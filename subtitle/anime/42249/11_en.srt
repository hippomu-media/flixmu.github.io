1
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:10,040
It's our victory!

2
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:12,150
Crap! It's the cop!

3
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:13,540
What should we do, Red?!

4
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:24,750
Let's get out of here!

5
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:26,070
Okay!

6
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:27,770
What about Kiyomasa-kun?

7
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:28,950
Leave him!

8
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:40,970
I've been running around,
doing stuff I'm not good at.

9
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:44,960
But none of them are pointless.

10
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:48,670
Because they're always
watching after me.

11
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,240
Thank you.

12
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,310
We did it, Takemichi.

13
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:58,190
Did you see my super miracle punch?

14
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,930
I did see you getting punched.

15
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:03,180
Everyone, don't just stand there!

16
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:06,350
Hurry up and take Draken-kun
and Takemichi to the ambulance!

17
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:09,070
-Ouch.
-Takemichi, stop your bleeding with this.

18
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,820
Draken-kun, can you stand?

19
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:14,070
-Somehow.
-Just where's the ambulance?!

20
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:15,990
Over here! Hurry!

21
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:18,270
Everyone! Here!

22
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:19,720
Hurry up!

23
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:23,390
-Come on! Come on!
-Hey, over here!

24
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,210
Man, I'm beat.

25
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:32,960
Heey!

26
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:35,320
We're done over here.

27
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,940
This guy just busted up his foot.

28
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,840
Got it, where's Mikey?

29
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:42,460
Over there.

30
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:53,940
Dull, isn't it, Mikey?

31
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:57,820
You don't even lose your breath,
what a monster.

32
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:59,110
Shut up.

33
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:00,350
Just die already.

34
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,990
Hanma-san, 'bout time.

35
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:08,610
Yeah.

36
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,540
Crap! It's the cop!

37
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:16,760
Get out of here!

38
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,120
Mikey.

39
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:25,960
The strongest and worst Bosozoku
alliance in Kanto will be born soon.

40
00:02:26,829 --> 00:02:28,770
It's Valhalla!

41
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:33,760
I am Valhalla's first Vice-President.

42
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:35,710
Shuji Hanma.

43
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:38,490
Remember that, Mikey.

44
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:41,870
From now on, there will
be no peace for Toman.

45
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:56,140
We got our collars grabbed
and took an intense punch

46
00:02:56,170 --> 00:03:01,050
After we got beaten up
Together we crouched

47
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:03,470
The anticipated rain came

48
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:11,810
"This should clean your bruise"
you lied with a smile

49
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:19,810
Even though you're bad at argument

50
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:25,030
So stop making such lame jokes

51
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:30,160
It's so bad I teared up

52
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:37,750
Getting blue bruises all the time
I cry, cry, and cry

53
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:44,420
Leaning our unstable heart together

54
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:49,090
We fight against the rotten Bad End

55
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:50,850
I wonder why

56
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:58,980
The pleasant pain was more vivid,
even more than the happiness

57
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:03,610
Clicking our tongue over our wet clothes

58
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:06,990
We look at each other's face and laugh

59
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:19,170
The Revenge we swore in that rainy night

60
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:33,400
Please be okay!

61
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:41,900
Draken-kun!

62
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:46,870
Thank you.

63
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:48,640
Takemicchi.

64
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:52,130
You're my savior.

65
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,250
Please, don't say that.

66
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:57,310
It isn't like you at all, Draken-kun.

67
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:03,130
Take care of... Mikey for me.

68
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:04,490
Eh?

69
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:08,440
He's going into cardiac arrest!
Sit back!

70
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:10,810
His JCS has dropped! Initiating CPR!

71
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:13,440
One! Two! Three!

72
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:15,770
Four! Five! Six!

73
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:17,860
-He's not coming back!
-One more time!

74
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,170
No way!

75
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:22,440
No way!

76
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:24,540
Draken-kun!

77
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:49,260
(Now Operating)

78
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:52,480
Takemichi-kun.

79
00:05:57,930 --> 00:05:59,100
Hina...

80
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,650
Emma-chan... Everyone...

81
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:11,370
-No way...
-Cardiac arrest?

82
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:13,080
This can't be true.

83
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,620
Tell me it's not.

84
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:18,270
I'm scared. Hina....

85
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:20,500
Emma-chan...

86
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:24,220
Takemicchi!

87
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:25,820
How's Draken?!

88
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:28,510
Mitsuya-kun! Peh-yan-kun!

89
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:39,310
Before we got to the hospital,
his pulse was already...

90
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:40,500
SHIT!

91
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:49,530
Mikey-kun...

92
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:53,940
Draken-kun is--

93
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:55,870
-Mikey.
-Mikey, I..!

94
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:57,500
You're being too loud.

95
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,540
We're in the hospital,
so keep it down.

96
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:02,170
Where's the waiting room?

97
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:08,630
Mikey...

98
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,150
Ken-chin.

99
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:22,780
He's the type of guy
who always keeps his words.

100
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:25,840
He won't drop at a place like this.

101
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:29,500
I definitely won't let it end like this.

102
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:31,650
He...

103
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:35,110
He promised me that
we'd take the top together.

104
00:07:36,659 --> 00:07:39,780
So Emma, Mitsuya, Peh-yan...

105
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:41,480
Takemicchi.

106
00:07:42,659 --> 00:07:44,320
Believe in Ken-chin.

107
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:51,840
Everything will be fine.

108
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,020
He's right.

109
00:07:57,330 --> 00:07:59,130
Losing our cool isn't gonna help.

110
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:03,540
Mikey-kun really is strong.

111
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:07,440
Listen, don't make commotion.

112
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:13,030
(Now Operating)

113
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:27,250
We stopped his life from passing.

114
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:28,340
Eh?

115
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,210
The surgery...

116
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,800
...was a success.

117
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:39,390
HELL YEEEEEAAAAH!!!

118
00:08:39,429 --> 00:08:42,289
Draken-kun is saved!

119
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:46,730
-Hina!
-Thank goodness! I'm so happy for you!

120
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:48,380
Yes! Yes! Yes!

121
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,230
Keep it down, guys.

122
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:52,530
Let's go tell the guys waiting outside.

123
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:53,530
Yes!

124
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:00,080
Peh-yan-kun?

125
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:01,850
I...

126
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:04,410
I can't meet up with everyone.

127
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:07,000
Peh-yan.

128
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:12,260
Everyone will understand that
you did all that for Pah-chin.

129
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:14,120
Mitsuya...

130
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:20,450
But Peh-yan, the one who thinks about
Pah-chin the most is Draken.

131
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,230
Still going though you can't meet him?

132
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:25,310
Ah?

133
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:27,250
It's fine, no big deal.

134
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:33,400
Ever since that incident, he goes with
Pah-chin's parents and visits him every day.

135
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:37,080
He would always bring gifts even
though only relatives can meet him,

136
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:40,530
and he'd wait outside by himself
during the whole visit.

137
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:46,460
And that's the guy
you tried to kill!

138
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:49,070
Draken...!

139
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:51,630
You'd better apologize.

140
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:54,270
To Draken, to Pah-chin.

141
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:56,100
And to everyone.

142
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:02,460
Welcome back, Peh-yan.

143
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:15,230
Ooh, the rain stopped.

144
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:23,150
Ah! What should I do?
Look at the time!

145
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:24,350
It's past midnight!

146
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:27,120
It's August 4th already.

147
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:27,910
Eh?

148
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:31,880
You must save Ken Ryuguji on August 3rd.

149
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,970
That's your mission this time.

150
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:38,400
It's already August 4th.

151
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:44,890
Naoto.

152
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:47,090
I made it.

153
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:49,490
August 3rd is over.

154
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:51,820
I protected Draken!

155
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:54,910
Mission complete!

156
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:01,450
All of you be quiet!

157
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:03,700
There's no way Draken
would die like that!

158
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:06,020
-Yeah!
-But man, I'm so glad.

159
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:08,070
Okay, let's go home now.

160
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:11,790
Eh?

161
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:13,750
Where's Mikey-kun?

162
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:25,740
That's weird, where did he go to?

163
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:30,260
Ah, Mike-!

164
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:43,710
Thank goodness!

165
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:47,810
Ken-chin!

166
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:07,430
Don't make me worry like that.

167
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:23,470
August 10th.

168
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:27,200
One week after the big
brawl of August 3rd.

169
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,410
Rumor about the fight spreads...

170
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:31,500
Ah! It's Takemichi-senpai!

171
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:34,170
Eh? You mean that guy
who stopped the battle of 8/3?

172
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:36,040
Seriously?! He's so cool!

173
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:40,590
I've become "The Man of Hour" overnight
among the city's delinquents.

174
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:43,660
Crap! I can't return to the future now!

175
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:46,280
Why did we waste our
time saving this jackass?

176
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:50,240
Draken-kun!

177
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:52,130
I'm here to visit ya'!

178
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:54,490
How the things goin'?

179
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,690
Quit acting like a jackass.

180
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:59,190
E-Eh? How am I acting like one?

181
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:02,030
It's written all over your body.

182
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:06,140
Don't get carried away just because
you get a little attention, dumbass!

183
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:07,770
That's lame.

184
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:13,120
You would never understand, Draken-kun.

185
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,130
Just how I feel living under the shadow.

186
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:16,290
Huh? Creep.

187
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:20,460
I've never been looked up
by anyone before!

188
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:22,960
Just let me enjoy it a little, okay?!

189
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:26,340
I'm impressed you'd admit something
that depressing so loudly.

190
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:28,830
Tch, you're no fun.

191
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:32,860
You said I was your savior, but when
you start getting better it's back to this.

192
00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:35,950
That's right.

193
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:37,250
Here.

194
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:42,420
Mikey told me to give this to you.

195
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:47,490
A Tokko-fuku!

196
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:51,450
It's the uniform Mikey wore
when he first started Toman.

197
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,780
For Toman, it's as important as life itself.

198
00:13:56,830 --> 00:13:58,960
Why is he giving me something
this valuable?

199
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:01,710
It's up to you whether to
wear it or not.

200
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:04,900
But he said he wants you to keep it.

201
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:09,180
Takemicchi, you're a benefactor for Toman.

202
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:10,980
Everyone acknowledges that.

203
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:12,670
I'm one of them.

204
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:18,240
Let me give you my thanks once again.

205
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,270
Thank you.

206
00:14:25,610 --> 00:14:26,620
That uniform.

207
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,520
Take good care of it.

208
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:35,410
Mikey-kun's...

209
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:39,400
This is too heavy for me.

210
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:44,930
Do you think I can be a man
worthy of this one day?

211
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:47,920
Go see him.

212
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,040
Eh?

213
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:52,100
I'm sure he's taking a nap on the rooftop.

214
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,410
Mikey-kun.

215
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,930
This doesn't feel right.

216
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:07,910
Eh?

217
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:10,880
I can't shake off this
weird feeling in my head.

218
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:16,860
Why did Hanma try to start
an infight within Toman?

219
00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:21,100
Why did he try to kill Ken-chin
using Kiyomasa and his group?

220
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:23,690
But the biggest mystery...

221
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:26,920
You knew about the infight and
that Ken-chin would be targeted

222
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:28,840
before anyone else.

223
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:31,300
And you tried to stop both from happening.

224
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:32,890
Takemicchi.

225
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:38,810
Just what are you?

226
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:42,350
I...

227
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,860
I...

228
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:55,160
What's with that lame outfit?

229
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,010
Eh?

230
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:57,660
You always look lame, though.

231
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:00,200
E-Erm, well, this is just...

232
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,500
Well, whatever.

233
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,620
Eh?

234
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:05,970
Ken-chin is saved thanks to you.

235
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,410
Thank you, Takemicchi.

236
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:26,650
Mikey-kun, Draken-kun, Akkun.

237
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:30,410
To be honest, I want to
stay with them forever.

238
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,470
But I must go home now.

239
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:37,620
Everyone... goodbye.

240
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,090
Takemichi-kun?

241
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:49,040
You always come to my house
without notice.

242
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,930
Sorry 'bout that.

243
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,550
Anyway, is Naoto here?

244
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:57,390
Naoto! Takemichi-kun is calling you!

245
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:02,010
Just wait here.

246
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,340
Ah, Hina!

247
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:06,750
Here.

248
00:17:08,690 --> 00:17:11,030
Eh? A necklace?

249
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:14,950
You know, for failing to make it up to
you and getting you caught up in that.

250
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:17,700
Ah, you mean the festival?

251
00:17:18,069 --> 00:17:20,410
So I'm like making up
for not making up.

252
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:21,849
It's cheap though.

253
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:23,869
Four-leaf clover?

254
00:17:23,869 --> 00:17:24,970
Yeah.

255
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:27,040
Can I put it on?

256
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,160
Sure.

257
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:32,420
Actually, it's not just for that.

258
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:35,050
I want to leave something
tangible behind.

259
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:36,290
What do you think?

260
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:42,350
Because I won't be able to
meet the current you anymore.

261
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:46,080
Yeah, it looks good on you.

262
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:48,370
Thank you.

263
00:17:48,810 --> 00:17:50,210
I'll cherish it.

264
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,170
Errm...

265
00:17:52,610 --> 00:17:56,360
I'm sorry for interrupting while
you two are flirting...

266
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:57,920
But did you need something from me?

267
00:17:57,940 --> 00:17:59,570
Since when you're there?!

268
00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:01,220
Nice gift.

269
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:02,900
Hey, you were eavesdropping?!

270
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,650
I just came because you called.

271
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,550
Then why didn't you say something?!

272
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,110
Naoto.

273
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,040
Handshake.

274
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:11,920
Eh?

275
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:14,710
You like handshaking, Takemichi-kun?

276
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:16,920
Well yeah.

277
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,010
Hina.

278
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,180
Have a merry life.

279
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,390
What's up with that?

280
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:27,630
Naoto.

281
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:29,800
Okay.

282
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,240
I prevented Draken's death.

283
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:41,370
Now Draken will remain as the second
top member of Toman in the present.

284
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:43,420
And Kisaki won't be.

285
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:46,410
Mikey who changed because
of Draken-kun's death.

286
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:49,420
Akkun who committed suicide
because of his fear of Kisaki.

287
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:53,570
And lastly, Hina who was killed by
the evil Toman in the present.

288
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:57,560
If Draken's still alive,
everything should change!

289
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:00,800
Isn't that right, Naoto?

290
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:11,480
How many times are you going to make me
say the same thing, Takemichi Hanagaki-kun?

291
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,530
Eh?

292
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:14,150
Manager?

293
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:18,530
When a DVD gets returned,
put it back on display immediately.

294
00:19:18,530 --> 00:19:20,820
Please do it now.

295
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,080
I'm at work?!

296
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:24,990
Eh? Eh?

297
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:26,900
Wait a second, what's going on?

298
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,990
Didn't I get fired
from my part-time job?

299
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:30,920
Huh? Eh?

300
00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:32,420
What about Naoto?

301
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:34,500
Ah! My phone!

302
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:40,590
No matter how many times I searched,
I can't find the news of Hina's death!

303
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:43,090
Was my time leap all just a dream?

304
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,850
A-Anyway, I must call Naoto.

305
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:49,580
Why is Naoto's number not in here?!

306
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:04,140
It wasn't a dream.

307
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,120
My schedule notification?

308
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:13,700
Hairdresser? What's this?

309
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:28,830
Akkun!

310
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:31,100
Akkun!

311
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:35,000
What is he doing?

312
00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:38,650
That was fast,
what about your part-time job?

313
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:40,130
I left early.

314
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:42,240
Don't get fired, okay?

315
00:20:42,890 --> 00:20:43,920
Akkun.

316
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:45,870
Did you become a hairdresser?

317
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:48,410
Huh? I'm still in training.

318
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:50,680
I told you I am still an assistant.

319
00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:54,710
I called you today because...

320
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:58,000
I'll finally be allowed to
cut people's hair next month.

321
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,880
I want you to be my haircut model.

322
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:02,050
You know, as my first customer.

323
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:04,710
You promised, didn't you?

324
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,850
I will be your first customer.

325
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:09,680
O-Okay...

326
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:12,940
Great! It's a promise, okay!

327
00:21:15,770 --> 00:21:18,860
What is it? You didn't forget, did you?

328
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,690
Dumbass! No way I'd forget!

329
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:22,730
Are you crying?

330
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:25,320
Dumbass! I'm not crying!

331
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:28,780
You're a crybaby as always, Takemichi.

332
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:33,410
I finally understand.

333
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:36,170
I changed the present!

334
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,290
I really succeed!

335
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,040
I don't know this number.

336
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:46,630
Hello?

337
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:48,340
So you succeed.

338
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:50,170
Huh? Who?

339
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:53,680
And you returned
from the past just now.

340
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:54,930
Naoto!

341
00:21:54,930 --> 00:21:57,850
Amazing. You really did it.

342
00:21:57,850 --> 00:21:59,440
Everything has changed.

343
00:22:00,810 --> 00:22:02,070
Takemichi-kun.

344
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:05,460
Let's go meet my sister.

345
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:06,950
Eh?!

346
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:10,040
Hina is alive!

347
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:26,630
I just want to be right next to you

348
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:29,890
Next to your slightly sweaty shirt

349
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:35,430
The rain falls all of the sudden

350
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:38,980
So I kissed you on that lonely night

351
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:48,900
If you look back, I will always
be there and smiling at you

352
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,660
Please

353
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:57,160
Give up on that unachievable future

354
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:59,540
Take it now

355
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:01,580
In the real new world

356
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:06,380
If I have to give you a name,
it's "My Hero"

357
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:08,420
That straight wish

358
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:10,760
Will go beyond the stopped time

359
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:15,600
"I don't need anyone but you"

360
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:23,150
I will keep living here

361
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:31,780
Break down that crooked needle

362
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:34,030
Shout out that firm words

363
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:36,790
Kick away that unmeaning destiny
