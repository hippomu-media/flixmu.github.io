1
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:09,880
Akkun...

2
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:11,540
Akkun!

3
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:15,390
What is he doing?

4
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:18,780
I called you today because...

5
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,020
I'll finally be allowed to
cut people's hair next month.

6
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:24,030
I want you to be my haircut model.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,630
You promised, didn't you?

8
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:31,320
I understand now.

9
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:33,640
I changed the present!

10
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:36,760
I really succeed!

11
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:42,450
I don't know this number.

12
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:43,750
Hello?

13
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:45,670
So you succeed.

14
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:47,830
Huh? Who?

15
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:51,000
And you returned from the past just now.

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,260
Naoto!

17
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:54,940
Amazing. You really did it.

18
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:56,960
Everything has changed.

19
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,030
Takemichi-kun.

20
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:02,520
Let's go meet my sister.

21
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,730
Eh?

22
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:06,410
Hina is alive!

23
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:29,800
Innocent civilians have fallen victim to the
growing dispute in the Tokyo Manji Gang.

24
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:33,250
-No way, seriously? That's scary.
-Six were injured in the dispute,

25
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,050
with one person in cardiac arrest
has been taken to the hospital.

26
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:39,170
At the place of incident,

27
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:44,060
Tachibana's older sister, 26 year old
Hinata Tachibana is confirmed dead.

28
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:46,950
The TMPD state that they
will be more vigilant on the matter.

29
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:50,200
Hinata... Tachibana?

30
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:53,900
That time I could only
watch what happened on TV.

31
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,289
But now I can meet Hina.

32
00:01:56,539 --> 00:01:58,289
Hina is alive.

33
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:03,200
When I checked, the incident that
killed my sister never even happened.

34
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:05,520
Eh? The Toman dispute?

35
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:06,540
Yes.

36
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:10,460
But I never imagined you'd
pull it off, Takemichi-kun.

37
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:13,020
Hah? What do you mean by that?

38
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:15,880
I mean, you're kind of a screw-up.

39
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,720
Are you trying to pick a fight with me?

40
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,290
But that doesn't matter, right?
We can meet my sister now.

41
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:26,520
He's right. I can meet Hina.

42
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:28,380
Naoto.

43
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:30,850
My heart is beating so hard right now.

44
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:34,920
To think I can meet Hina in the present
is like a dream for me.

45
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:47,079
We've arrived.

46
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:09,080
We got our collars grabbed
and took an intense punch

47
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:13,990
After we got beaten up
Together we crouched

48
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:16,410
The anticipated rain came

49
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:24,750
"This should clean your bruise"
you lied with a smile

50
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:32,750
Even though you're bad at argument

51
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:37,970
So stop making such lame jokes

52
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:43,100
It's so bad I teared up

53
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:50,690
Getting blue bruises all the time
I cry, cry, and cry

54
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:57,360
Leaning our unstable heart together

55
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:02,030
We fight against the rotten Bad End

56
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:03,790
I wonder why

57
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:11,920
The pleasant pain was more vivid,
even more than the happiness

58
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:16,550
Clicking our tongue over our wet clothes

59
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:19,930
We look at each other's face and laugh

60
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:32,110
The Revenge we swore in that rainy night

61
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:37,730
Do you think Hina has changed?

62
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:39,490
Of course she has.

63
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:42,930
It's been 12 years since the last
you meet her.

64
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:44,940
She's a full-fledged adult now.

65
00:04:46,159 --> 00:04:47,740
Full-fledged adult?

66
00:04:49,909 --> 00:04:53,210
It seems like my sister is now working
as a teacher in an elementary school.

67
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:54,610
I see.

68
00:04:56,909 --> 00:04:58,080
Takemichi-kun!

69
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:00,490
I missed you!

70
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:02,140
Stop that, Hina.

71
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,080
Good grief, still lovey-dovey, aren't you?

72
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:06,900
Naoto is watching.

73
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:18,230
Why am I getting carried away?

74
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:20,900
Even if I meet her, there's
no way that would happen.

75
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:30,110
Let's break up.

76
00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:54,200
Naoto.

77
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,780
Yes?

78
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:58,270
I think...

79
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,650
...I shouldn't meet her.

80
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:01,720
Huh?

81
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:03,440
What's up all of the sudden?

82
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:09,950
On the second thought...
I did save her life.

83
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:13,110
But Hina doesn't know anything about that.

84
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:19,330
You should go see her,
you are her younger brother.

85
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:22,570
But I'm just a complete stranger to her.

86
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,170
Takemichi-kun...

87
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:31,500
As long as she's having a happy life,
that's enough for me.

88
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:39,130
12 years...

89
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:41,250
It has been 12 years.

90
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:46,340
There's no way she'd remember
some guy from 12 years ago.

91
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,460
What am I doing?

92
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:00,540
I worked so hard but
I haven't changed a bit.

93
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:05,320
I'm still a 26-year-old virgin part-timer.

94
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:07,990
There's no way I can meet Hina.

95
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:13,130
No matter how much I leaped through time,
I'm still the same worthless guy.

96
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:28,820
But Hina is alive.

97
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:31,150
That should be enough.

98
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:33,159
If I wish anymore than that...

99
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:36,780
I should go back.

100
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:40,330
Back to my ordinary life.

101
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:44,750
Ah, sorr--

102
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:45,870
Eh?

103
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:52,840
Am I hallucinating?

104
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:56,600
Takemichi-kun?

105
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:02,180
No!

106
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,400
Eh...?

107
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:40,370
You're here...

108
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:43,179
...in front of me!

109
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:49,230
You always come without notice.

110
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:51,930
Did something happen?

111
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:54,230
No, it's nothing.

112
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:56,310
Crap, I can't stop.

113
00:08:57,310 --> 00:09:01,660
You're here looking at me
the same way you did back then.

114
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,390
E-Ermm...

115
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:27,600
Yes?!

116
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,160
What a nice weather we're having.

117
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:31,300
-Yes!
-It's cloudy.

118
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:36,400
It's been a long since the last time
you two met, but what is this?

119
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,490
Don't you have a lot of
stuff you can talk about?

120
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:40,950
But the first thing you talked
about is the weather?

121
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:43,750
Well, I'm nervous okay.

122
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,460
I'm not sure what to talk about.

123
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,410
It has been a long time, after all.

124
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,340
I will go home now.

125
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:56,180
Eh?!

126
00:09:56,210 --> 00:09:58,530
W-W-Wait, Naoto!

127
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,800
I can't stand this atmosphere.

128
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,330
Please continue just the two of you.
Goodbye.

129
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:06,890
If you leave us alone, my heart
will pump so hard I'll die!

130
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:08,910
Do you want to kill me, Naoto?!

131
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:10,650
I thought you were my buddy!

132
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:12,150
I'm not your buddy.

133
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:14,790
-That's cruel!
-Please let go of me.

134
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:16,990
You fiend! Devil!

135
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,530
You didn't change at all, Takemichi-kun.

136
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:25,610
Eh?

137
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,720
That necklace...

138
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:31,000
Is it the one I gave her before?!

139
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:33,880
How about we go on a drive?

140
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,820
Should be easier to chat that way.

141
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:38,300
I will drive.

142
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:39,980
-Eh?
-Okay!

143
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:52,360
It's exactly the same as before.

144
00:10:57,070 --> 00:10:58,610
What's going on?

145
00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:01,610
That is undoubtedly the necklace
I gave her as a present.

146
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:04,260
Could that mean Hina
is still into me?!

147
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:10,790
No, it is possible that the necklace
she just bought has the same design.

148
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:12,890
Yes, that must be the case.

149
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:17,170
Thank goodness, I was so
close to getting carried away.

150
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:19,640
But I should take a close
look at it once again.

151
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,680
So we need you as backup.

152
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,080
Understood.

153
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:30,880
I'm sorry, I just got a call from work.

154
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:32,060
Eh?

155
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:33,980
I will come back for the car tomorrow.

156
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:35,060
Okay.

157
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:38,440
W-W-Wait! You're going
to leave us alone?!

158
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:41,030
You two should just
start talking already.

159
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:43,070
Both of you are adults, not children.

160
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,490
Eeh?

161
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,230
Crap.

162
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:16,610
I completely lost my chance just now.

163
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:19,690
I don't know what to say
and how to say it.

164
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:28,490
But more importantly, that necklace.

165
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:31,200
I want to confirm my suspicion, but...

166
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:34,920
Hey, can I stop the car here?

167
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,210
Yes!

168
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:49,350
Let's take a little walk, Takemichi-kun.

169
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:50,470
Okay.

170
00:12:57,770 --> 00:13:01,000
This park takes me back.

171
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:04,030
Did you have some memories here?

172
00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:09,370
I came here with someone I liked.

173
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:12,000
I-I see...

174
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,790
On Christmas Eve.

175
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:22,880
What the hell was I so happy about?

176
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,380
"Necklace"?

177
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,960
"Still into me"?

178
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:31,170
Cut it out, she's 26 now.

179
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:32,960
Of course she has a boyfriend.

180
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:37,810
I'm nothing but her ex
she dumped 12 years ago.

181
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:41,110
I see, so this place must've
been special for you.

182
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:49,430
Even now, I still can't forget that person.

183
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:53,660
That night on Christmas Eve,
he dumped me here.

184
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:55,160
I don't want to hear that!

185
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:01,250
Wow, I can't believe anyone
would dump you, Hina.

186
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:03,000
What am I saying?

187
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,760
Why was I dumped?

188
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,430
I still don't get it.

189
00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:15,270
Tell me why, Takemichi-kun.

190
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:19,890
Eh? She's crying...

191
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:22,610
Could it be...

192
00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:24,350
That person you like...

193
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:28,180
That person you can't forget...

194
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:35,700
Sorry! I-I need the toilet!

195
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:38,090
Just wait for me in the car!

196
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:52,550
She dumped me, didn't she?

197
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:57,000
But in this world, I'm the one
who dumped her?

198
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:02,140
Even now, I still can't forget that person.

199
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,960
Is she really... still into me?

200
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:10,150
There's no way.

201
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:15,150
But... I can't just stand here
doing nothing!

202
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:22,190
I must change.

203
00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:26,470
I will ask her out!

204
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,720
Of course it won't go well.

205
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:32,520
But this is a chance for
me to change myself!

206
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:36,470
Eh?

207
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:39,140
You're not in the car?

208
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:40,620
How dull.

209
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:45,190
He's talking to himself?

210
00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:46,900
What a weird guy.

211
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:49,690
And I was hoping to
kill 'em all in one go.

212
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:55,990
But I'm in charge of Moebius.
For this moment, at least.

213
00:15:55,990 --> 00:15:57,410
I'm Hanma.

214
00:15:58,180 --> 00:15:59,420
Hanma?!

215
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:05,120
I have bad feeling about this.

216
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:07,860
You're not in the car?

217
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:09,510
Car?

218
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,980
After I worked up all that courage...

219
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:51,870
Hina!

220
00:17:10,609 --> 00:17:13,900
HINA!!!

221
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:16,910
Take...michi...?

222
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:21,130
You...

223
00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:22,720
...Why?

224
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:28,670
Why... are you... not in the...car?

225
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:30,880
No way...

226
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:33,590
Akkun?!

227
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:37,120
Why... are you here?

228
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:46,020
Just how... did I end up... like this?

229
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:49,090
Just how did I end up like this?

230
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:54,200
I'm now one of Kisaki's men.

231
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:59,840
Everyone in Toman is controlled by Kisaki.

232
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:02,740
He's saying the same thing as before!

233
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:04,580
Why did you hit Hina?

234
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:08,400
You're a hairdresser! Toman should
have nothing to do with you!

235
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:10,470
I'm scared.

236
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:14,240
I'm simply too scared of Kisaki.

237
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:16,410
Stop it.

238
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:21,610
Save... everyone.

239
00:18:23,050 --> 00:18:26,370
Our crybaby hero.

240
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:27,980
Stop it!

241
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:29,900
I already heard you said that last time!

242
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,900
Isn't this the same again?

243
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:33,860
Nothing has changed!

244
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:35,760
It should have been changed, right?!

245
00:18:58,770 --> 00:18:59,970
Hina!

246
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:02,470
Hina!

247
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:05,850
She's alive!

248
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:08,920
Just wait, Hina! I will save you now!

249
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:22,440
Hina! Let's get out of here!

250
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:25,140
Takemichi-kun...

251
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:29,380
Hina! There's no time to talk!
This car will explode soon!

252
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:31,360
Thank you...

253
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,870
Save that for later! Hurry up!

254
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:36,560
I can't...

255
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:37,740
Eh?

256
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:42,330
My legs...

257
00:19:42,910 --> 00:19:45,510
I can't feel it.. anymore...

258
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:03,240
Eh?

259
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:07,030
No matter it's in the future or past...

260
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:09,660
I will always... and always...

261
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:12,440
Love you!

262
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:19,320
I'm glad.

263
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:23,470
Go now.

264
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:24,850
No.

265
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:26,930
I beg you.

266
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:31,740
I don't want the person
I love to die, too.

267
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:33,230
No!

268
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:43,350
Takemichi-kun!

269
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:47,600
Hina!

270
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:42,460
I will definitely save you!

271
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,800
No matter how many times I fail!

272
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,930
I will try over and over!

273
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:49,990
Until I reach the future where
you're saved...

274
00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:52,030
I definitely won't give up!

275
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:01,140
I've decided, Hina.

276
00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:05,190
I...

277
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:06,870
I will...

278
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:09,280
I will become the top member of Toman!

279
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:26,630
I just want to be right next to you

280
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:29,890
Next to your slightly sweaty shirt

281
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:35,430
The rain falls all of the sudden

282
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:38,980
So I kissed you on that lonely night

283
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:48,900
If you look back, I will always
be there and smiling at you

284
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,660
Please

285
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:57,160
Give up on that unachievable future

286
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:59,540
Take it now

287
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:01,580
In the real new world

288
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:06,380
If I have to give you a name,
it's "My Hero"

289
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:08,420
That straight wish

290
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:10,760
Will go beyond the stopped time

291
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:15,600
"I don't need anyone but you"

292
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:23,150
I will keep living here

293
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:31,860
Break down that crooked needle

294
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:34,120
Shout out that firm words

295
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:36,790
Kick away that unmeaning destiny
