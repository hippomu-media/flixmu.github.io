1
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:10,470
I must meet the leaders of
the Tokyo Manji gang.

2
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:14,920
Both Sano and Kisaki!

3
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:23,060
We got our collars grabbed
and took an intense punch

4
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:27,940
After we got beaten up
Together we crouched

5
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:30,360
The anticipated rain came

6
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:38,700
"This should clean your bruise"
you lied with a smile

7
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:46,700
Even though you're bad at argument

8
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:51,920
So stop making such lame jokes

9
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:57,050
It's so bad I teared up

10
00:00:57,050 --> 00:01:04,640
Getting blue bruises all the time
I cry, cry, and cry

11
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:11,310
Leaning our unstable heart together

12
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:15,980
We fight against the rotten Bad End

13
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:17,740
I wonder why

14
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:25,870
The pleasant pain was more vivid,
even more than the happiness

15
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:30,500
Clicking our tongue over our wet clothes

16
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:33,880
We look at each other's face and laugh

17
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:46,060
The Revenge we swore in that rainy night

18
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:58,710
I'll never be able to meet
them if I keep on being a slave!

19
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,430
You better not regret this.

20
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:08,509
I can't win.

21
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:12,170
Our difference in power was so big,
I can tell it in an instant.

22
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:14,690
What's wrong, Hanagaki?

23
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:17,130
Are you just all talk?

24
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:20,160
You better not get one-hit
KO'd like last time!

25
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:24,579
Takemichi!

26
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,540
Takemichi!

27
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:51,510
That's enough, Takemichi!

28
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:53,420
Give up or you will die!

29
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:03,160
I'm not done yet!

30
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:12,820
Kill him, Kiyomasa-kun!

31
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:16,190
Finish him!

32
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:17,530
Finish him!

33
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:19,750
Finish him!

34
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:21,329
Finish him!

35
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,120
Finish him!

36
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:24,400
Finish him!

37
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,190
Finish him!

38
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:28,000
Finish him!

39
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:31,770
Kiyomasa...

40
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:01,480
Not yet...

41
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:04,680
I'm not over yet!

42
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,680
That's enough, Takemichi!

43
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,380
You will seriously die!

44
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:10,690
Takemichi, stop this already!

45
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,550
Not yet!

46
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:17,410
This is not enough.

47
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:20,920
To heal...

48
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:23,350
...my broken heart...

49
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:27,050
...that has been through those 12 years!

50
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:30,480
What the heck is he saying?

51
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:35,810
I ran... I ran...

52
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:38,120
I ran and ran...

53
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:42,340
You're the only one
who can save my sister.

54
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:52,580
Give up already, Takemichi!

55
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,700
You already showed enough of your spirit!

56
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:57,260
I ain't giving up!

57
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,750
I have a reason to not give up!

58
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:05,590
Tokyo Manji Gang...

59
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:07,360
Kiyomasa...

60
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:12,440
The only way to win is to kill me!

61
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:17,270
I definitely won't lose!

62
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:21,830
I...

63
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,780
I will save Hina!

64
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:26,830
Bring me my bat!

65
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:27,880
This is bad!

66
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:29,430
We must go save Takemichi!

67
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,260
Fine by me!

68
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:34,650
I will kill you.

69
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:36,409
Did he say bat?

70
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:38,830
Isn't this supposed to be one-on-one?

71
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:41,050
Hurry up and bring me my bat, you shits!

72
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:43,230
Oi, Kiyomasa.

73
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:47,100
You're creeping the crowd.

74
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:52,680
Who's it?

75
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:55,430
Why are you getting so worked up?

76
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:57,020
You're the host here.

77
00:05:57,909 --> 00:05:59,750
A blond braid...

78
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:02,220
And a dragon tattoo on his temple...

79
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:03,700
No way...

80
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:07,650
The vice-president of the Tokyo Manji Gang...

81
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:10,760
Ken Ryuguji!

82
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:11,740
(Tokyo Manji Gang Vice-president - Ken Ryuguji)

83
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:13,830
Also known as Draken!
(Tokyo Manji Gang Vice-president - Ken Ryuguji)

84
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:16,630
Hey hey, Ken-chin.

85
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:17,880
Hah?

86
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:21,670
Don't call me by that
nickname at a place like this.

87
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:24,020
All my Dorayaki's gone.

88
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:25,840
What the hell is up with that guy?

89
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:28,610
He can't read the atmosphere at all.

90
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:32,370
Good work!

91
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:34,320
Good work!

92
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:36,400
Good work!

93
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:44,700
Could he be...!

94
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,840
Good work, President!

95
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:51,540
(Tokyo Manji Gang President - Manjiro Sano)

96
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:57,030
The leader of the Tokyo
Manji Gang, Manjiro Sano!

97
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,210
Sano-kun!

98
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:04,040
I'm Akaishi from the 3rd Squad!

99
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:06,680
You're in the way.

100
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:09,680
Mikey ain't talking to a guy
he's not interested in.

101
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:12,370
I... I'm sorry.

102
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,100
Is this real?

103
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:17,220
Even that Red-kun can't
say anything back at him!

104
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:21,580
Good work.

105
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:32,070
Kiyomasa, since when you
become so important?

106
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:36,080
You're seriously greeting the president
with that shallow bow?

107
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,010
I-I understand.

108
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,830
What's your name?

109
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:53,760
T-Takemichi... Hanagaki.

110
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,350
I see.

111
00:07:56,530 --> 00:07:57,909
Takemicchi.

112
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,570
Eh? Takemicchi?

113
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:04,870
That's what Mikey said,
so that's what is right, Takemicchi.

114
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,360
Eh?

115
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:11,480
Are you seriously a middle schooler?

116
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:18,900
Takemicchi, you're now my buddy, okay?

117
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:20,960
Eh?

118
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:27,780
Are you the host?

119
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:29,080
Ah, yes.

120
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,650
Who the heck are you?

121
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:48,640
Kiyomasa...

122
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:53,880
Well then...

123
00:08:54,890 --> 00:08:56,670
Let's go home, Ken-chin.

124
00:08:57,190 --> 00:08:59,430
Underground fights are stupid.

125
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:03,470
Don't do things that ruin
the name of Toman.

126
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:05,600
Takemicchi.

127
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:07,850
See ya later.

128
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:12,290
Don't just stand there.
Go away already.

129
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:24,280
So he's the boss of Toman, Manjiro Sano.

130
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:29,310
You were awesome, Takemichi!

131
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:31,630
I was deeply moved!

132
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:32,610
Eh?

133
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:35,890
You got that invincible Mikey to like you!

134
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:38,190
You're amazing, Takemichi!

135
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:39,810
As I thought...

136
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:44,070
I got myself liked by that monster!

137
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,200
Lick it.

138
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:48,480
-Yes, Master!
-I just went from being Kiyomasa's slave

139
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:52,210
to a toy of monster I can't understand!

140
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:54,230
It's just another hell!

141
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:57,040
Why it must be me?!

142
00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:00,480
From today onward,
you're Takemicchi, got it?

143
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:04,140
That's what Mikey said,
so that's what is right, Takemicchi.

144
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:07,450
Idiots sure have it easy.

145
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:12,250
They sure are idiots, aren't they?

146
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:14,270
Mmn? Yeah.

147
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:19,490
But it's been long since last time
I saw them acting like idiots.

148
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:26,600
Takemichi.

149
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,670
I....

150
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:33,740
...actually tried to stab Kiyomasa-kun.

151
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:34,690
Eh?

152
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:36,000
Think about it.

153
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:39,020
If things stay as they were, we'd
spend the rest of our lives as slaves.

154
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,060
We'd have no choice but to kill him.

155
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,210
Akkun...

156
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:47,270
You do care about your friends a lot.

157
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:49,750
Thank you, Takemichi.

158
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:51,200
Eh?

159
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:56,290
Thanks to your hard work, we're
finally freed from being slaves.

160
00:10:56,810 --> 00:10:58,430
You were really cool.

161
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:01,680
Cut it out, you're making me blush.

162
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:07,670
Yamagishi! You don't even sound like him!

163
00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:09,600
Shut up, Takemicchi!

164
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:18,790
School sure is a pain in the ass.

165
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:24,660
Why eighth in the morning?
It's too early!

166
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:27,080
Morning, Takemichi-kun!

167
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,320
Hina!

168
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:32,840
You're going to school in
the morning! Good boy!

169
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:36,690
I'll be going to cram school
this afternoon.

170
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:38,650
Oh, is that so?

171
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:40,500
Let's have a date on
our way to cram school.

172
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:41,870
Oh, okay.

173
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:44,380
So you would even call that a date?

174
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:47,460
Going to school together is also a date.

175
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:52,640
Aaaah, if only I'm in
the same class as you.

176
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:56,710
School is the best!

177
00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:01,410
This part is important.
Make sure you remember this.

178
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:05,310
But still, it's not the time to
be happy about it.

179
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:09,290
Tetta Kisaki and Manjiro Sano.

180
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:11,480
Stop them from meeting each other.

181
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:15,180
If you can do that,
my sister will be saved.

182
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:20,260
Naoto... I met Manjiro Sano.

183
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:22,460
By coincidence, though.

184
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:25,730
In order to save Hina who got
caught and died in their mess,

185
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,840
I must stop Tokyo Manji Gang's dispute.

186
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:35,700
And to do that, I must prevent the two
leaders of Touman from meeting each other!

187
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:40,770
I somehow managed to meet
one of the leaders, Manjiro Sano.

188
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:45,790
But I have no idea
what to do from now on!

189
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:50,330
Preventing them from meeting is really
difficult if you think about it, isn't it?

190
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:52,270
From what school are you?!

191
00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:54,360
Don't just barge into someone's
school as you like!

192
00:12:56,070 --> 00:12:58,090
Oh, there you are.

193
00:12:58,450 --> 00:12:59,360
Eh?

194
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:02,070
Let's play, Takemicchi.

195
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:04,360
E-Erm, we're in middle of class...

196
00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:07,750
This guy... is absurd!

197
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:12,020
A-All the 3rd years...

198
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:14,770
Umm, what's happening here?

199
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:17,060
Ah, this?

200
00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:19,100
They pissed me off,
so I knocked 'em down.

201
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,990
All of you, line up right here.

202
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:25,620
Laying face down, okay?

203
00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:29,220
Hey, too much space in-between.

204
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:31,140
It's you guys who will
get hurt from that.

205
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:32,230
Eh?

206
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,250
Just what are they gonna do?

207
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:41,470
The Tokyo Manji Gang
is crazy as I thought.

208
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:45,120
I heard the team from Udagawa is
making Shinsen their territory.

209
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:47,840
Sounds fun. Let's go beat them up.

210
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:53,170
Tormenting people is an
everyday occurrence for them!

211
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,660
To them, it's the same
as washing their face.

212
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:59,200
You feelin' good?

213
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:01,250
Well, last we met was yesterday.

214
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,430
You're free today, right?

215
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:04,430
Well... not exactly.

216
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:05,950
Let's hang out for a little.

217
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:06,840
Eh?

218
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:09,460
Mikey-kun, did you listen
to what I said?

219
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:13,370
Is he actually friends with Mikey?

220
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,310
We got someone that
amazing in this school?

221
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:17,970
Hey, isn't that Takemichi?

222
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:20,730
Didn't Mikey like him?

223
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:23,460
What did he do in these past few days?

224
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:26,150
This is bad, they will kill him!

225
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:29,370
Tachibana?

226
00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:32,800
Mikey? As in Mikey from Toman?

227
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:34,750
Does that mean the other guy is Draken?

228
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:37,300
You're too loud. Do you want
them to beat you again?

229
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:41,180
-There's no need to be so tense.
-I see, this is a chance!

230
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:45,880
I just have to stay close to Mikey and
prevent him from meeting Tetta Kisaki.

231
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:48,040
-Let's go then.
-Hold it right there!

232
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:53,410
Who?

233
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,780
Hina?!

234
00:14:57,300 --> 00:15:00,270
Sorry, turned out I had
something else to do today.

235
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:11,740
Takemichi-kun, let's go.

236
00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:14,350
You mustn't let people
like them dictate you.

237
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:15,300
Eh?

238
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,100
I will protect you.

239
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:18,630
Hina...

240
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,450
She's trembling.

241
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:25,260
Hey.

242
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:26,880
Do you want me to kill you, bitch?

243
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:30,410
You gonna slap someone
and leave just like that?

244
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:32,130
Don't you play around with me!

245
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:34,480
Who's the one playing around here?

246
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:39,870
Coming to others' school
and take someone by force...

247
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:42,430
It's not what a friend would do!

248
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:46,020
Takemichi-kun have been getting
nothing but injuries lately.

249
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,720
If that was because of you guys...

250
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:52,340
I will not forgive you!

251
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:55,170
Huh?

252
00:15:58,090 --> 00:16:00,490
Let go of her hand.

253
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:04,930
What are you saying? I can't hear you!

254
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,590
I will protect you.

255
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:14,110
I told you to let go of her hand, idiot!

256
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:19,750
I already promised that I will
protect Hina this time!

257
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:24,290
Do you know who you're talking to?

258
00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:29,930
I ain't gonna give her up ever again!

259
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,200
Huh?

260
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:32,740
Again?

261
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,070
Aaaaah...

262
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:39,940
And here I thought we can
be great buddies. Too bad.

263
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:42,000
Well then...

264
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:44,250
How do you want to die?

265
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:50,250
Promise me....

266
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:53,930
Promise me this one thing!

267
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:59,170
Don't you dare lay your hand on Hina!

268
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:03,760
Huh? Who cares.

269
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:06,859
Just kidding.

270
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:09,359
Eh?

271
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:13,010
Takemicchi, you dummy.

272
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:17,950
There's no way I'd lay a hand on a girl.

273
00:17:20,579 --> 00:17:22,119
Takemicchi.

274
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,329
You were trying to threaten me, huh?

275
00:17:24,329 --> 00:17:26,010
S-Sorry...

276
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:27,290
It's fine.

277
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:28,030
Eh?

278
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:30,750
"I ain't gonna give her up."

279
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:34,030
No one says that in front of a girl
nowadays, you know?

280
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:35,330
You're so Showa.

281
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:44,430
You surprised me, you know.

282
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:47,720
Huh? Takemichi-kun...

283
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:49,940
Are they...

284
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:54,560
I'm very sorry!

285
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:57,990
I've misread the situation.

286
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:00,100
It's fine.

287
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:02,470
That was an amazing slap.

288
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:04,230
I'm sorry!

289
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,860
Doing your best for the sake of
someone you love is good and all,

290
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,510
but you mustn't do anything reckless.

291
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:12,360
Depending on who you're dealing with,
it might not end up good.

292
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:13,680
Yes!

293
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,320
I'll go now.

294
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:18,750
Ah, yeah.

295
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:20,700
Then what about our date?

296
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,260
We can do it in another day.

297
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:26,040
Your friends came all the way here
to play with you, after all.

298
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,840
Bye bye!

299
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:29,600
Don't slap me next time, okay?

300
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:35,610
What a good girl.

301
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:39,130
Girls like her are rare, you know.

302
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:41,560
You should treat her well.

303
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:50,250
I learned about the Tokyo Manji Gang
12 years in the future from Naoto.

304
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:54,700
They're a heinous gang who would
do gamble, fraud, assault, murder,

305
00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:57,070
and a bunch of other crimes.

306
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:00,500
Underground fights are stupid.

307
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:03,340
There's no way I'd lay a hand on a girl.

308
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:08,470
Is this person really the leader
of that hideous Toman gang?

309
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,980
Umm, Mikey-kun.

310
00:19:12,010 --> 00:19:13,040
Nnn?

311
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:14,330
Well...

312
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:17,250
Why did you take a liking
in someone like me?

313
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:19,360
What a stupid question.

314
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:21,410
Aah... I'm sorry.

315
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:28,340
I have a brother ten years older than me.

316
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:31,820
He's dead, though.

317
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
He was a reckless guy.

318
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:39,810
He'd pick a fight against someone
stronger than him like it's normal.

319
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:41,740
Ooh.

320
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:43,820
He sounds like a cool person.

321
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:46,540
You're like my older brother, Takemicchi.

322
00:19:46,570 --> 00:19:49,700
Eh? N-No, I'm not as cool as him!

323
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:51,330
No matter how you look at me.

324
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:53,750
Well, true he wasn't as lame as you.

325
00:19:53,770 --> 00:19:55,420
That's mean...

326
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:03,510
People call delinquents "lame"
in this era, isn't it?

327
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:08,080
I see... So that way of thinking
already spread even back now.

328
00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:15,200
There were a lot of Bosozoku
back during my brother's era.

329
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:18,760
They'd ride through the street
with their loud pipes.

330
00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:23,840
Everyone acted big.

331
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:25,730
All they do was fighting.

332
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:29,110
But they would always take
care of their own mess.

333
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:32,510
What was so lame about those guys?

334
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:43,520
That's why I'm going to create
an era for delinquents.

335
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:47,430
You should come with me.

336
00:20:51,770 --> 00:20:53,660
I like your guts.

337
00:20:54,050 --> 00:20:55,350
Takemichi Hanagaki.

338
00:20:57,740 --> 00:21:00,950
There are plenty of guys who
are good at fighting.

339
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,580
But...

340
00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:07,220
There aren't that many guys like you
who would stand against anyone

341
00:21:07,790 --> 00:21:10,480
for what they can't give up.

342
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:15,290
Think about it, Takemicchi.

343
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:30,100
Mikey is a delinquent,
but he's not a bad guy.

344
00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:33,850
At the very least, he's not the type of guy
who would drive a truck into a festival

345
00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:36,140
and kill innocents like Hina.

346
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:42,560
He's definitely not the boss of an organization
like Tokyo Manji Gang 12 years in the future.

347
00:21:44,290 --> 00:21:46,550
Just what changed Mikey?

348
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:54,170
Manjiro Sano and Tetta Kisaki.

349
00:21:54,850 --> 00:21:59,400
If these two hadn't met, the current
Tokyo Manji Gang wouldn't exist.

350
00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:01,890
Eh?

351
00:22:04,550 --> 00:22:05,630
Mnn?

352
00:22:06,290 --> 00:22:09,290
It feels like I have seen
him somewhere before.

353
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:26,630
I just want to be right next to you

354
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:29,890
Next to your slightly sweaty shirt

355
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:35,430
The rain falls all of the sudden

356
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:38,980
So I kissed you in that lonely night

357
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:48,900
If you look back, I will always
be there and smiling at you

358
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,660
Please

359
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:57,160
Give up on that unachievable future

360
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:59,540
Take it now

361
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:01,580
In the real new world

362
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:06,380
If I have to give you a name,
it's "My Hero"

363
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:08,420
That straight wish

364
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:10,760
Will go beyond the stopped time

365
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:15,600
"I don't need anyone but you"

366
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:23,150
I will keep living here

367
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:31,820
Break down that crooked needle

368
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:34,070
Shout out that firm words

369
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:36,790
Kick away that unmeaning destiny
