1
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:05,800
I didn't expect my life
would end up like this.

2
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:09,410
I live in a beat-up apartment
with thin walls.

3
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:12,310
My manager who's younger
than me treats me like an idiot.

4
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:16,430
Even kids made fun of me,
and I had to apologize for them.

5
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:20,140
I've only ever got one girlfriend in life,
and that was back in middle school.

6
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:23,210
Just where did I go wrong?

7
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:26,840
Eh?

8
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:29,930
No way...

9
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:36,630
Eh?

10
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:39,120
Who is this lame delinquent?

11
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,850
It's me! It's me from middle school!

12
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:43,500
So lame!

13
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:45,500
I'm hungry

14
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:47,470
I wanna eat some katsudon.

15
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:52,930
What's wrong, Takemichi?

16
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,040
Sorry, I gotta go.

17
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:58,210
Eh? Go where?!

18
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:03,190
Yes?

19
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:05,349
Eh? Hanagaki-kun?

20
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,640
Did you get into a fight again?

21
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:10,390
You shouldn't go fighting
all the time, you know?

22
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:17,380
Eh?

23
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,500
Are you one of my sister's friends?

24
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,789
Naoto Tachibana.

25
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:28,289
That's right. This guy will die
in the next 12 years, too.

26
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:31,430
On July 1st, 12 years from now on,

27
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:34,890
your sister... will die.

28
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:39,390
And you will die with
her at the same time.

29
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:42,789
July 1st, 2017.

30
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:45,270
Remember that date, Naoto.

31
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:47,570
And protect your sister.

32
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:50,680
I understand.

33
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:57,120
Please help me out.

34
00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:01,070
I'm sure you can save my sister!

35
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:03,620
I can...

36
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,630
...save Tachibana?

37
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:22,180
Time leap.

38
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:26,329
I have my own theory on
how your power works.

39
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:34,500
You jumped from July 4th, 2017 in
the present to July 4th, 2005 in the past.

40
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:38,370
In other words, you can return to
the same day 12 years in the past.

41
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,780
I believe that's the power that you have.

42
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:51,060
We got our collars grabbed
and took an intense punch

43
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:55,940
After we got beaten up
Together we crouched

44
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:58,360
The anticipated rain came

45
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:06,700
“This should clean your bruise”
you lied with a smile

46
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:14,700
Even though you're bad at argument

47
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:19,920
So stop making such lame jokes

48
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:25,050
It's so bad I teared up

49
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:32,640
Getting blue bruises all the time
I cry, cry, and cry

50
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:39,310
Leaning our unstable heart together

51
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:43,980
We fight against the rotten Bad End

52
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:45,740
I wonder why

53
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:53,870
The pleasant pain was more vivid,
even more than the happiness

54
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:58,500
Clicking our tongue over our wet clothes

55
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:01,880
We look at each other's face and laugh

56
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:14,060
The Revenge we swore in that rainy night

57
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,470
I'm sleepy.

58
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,950
That part is important.

59
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:25,160
Did you read that part properly?

60
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:28,040
And this, too.

61
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:31,140
You went too far.

62
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:33,780
Yes, there. Remember that, too.

63
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:36,480
Two days has passed since then.

64
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:40,159
I'm confined inside Naoto's room
and haven't slept since.

65
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:48,290
I'll teach you everything there is
to know about Tokyo Manji Gang.

66
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,340
Naoto is crazy.

67
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,409
He's planning to kill me.

68
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:58,560
Five days ago on July 1st.

69
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:01,200
Hinata Tachibana got caught in a dispute

70
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:04,830
between the criminal organization,
Tokyo Manji Gang and died.

71
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,400
During the day of the festival,

72
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:10,730
a truck hit the stall she was in and die.

73
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:13,070
She was 26 years old at that time.

74
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:17,120
You can find detail about the
Tokyo Manji Gang's actions

75
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:20,690
that has yet been disclosed
to the public in that repot.

76
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:24,270
My predecessor risked his life
to investigate it.

77
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:28,060
The one in that last picture is him.

78
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:29,350
Eh?

79
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:33,000
His cover was blown during
the investigation and they killed him.

80
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:38,960
His eyeballs... were scoop open.

81
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:43,210
And a device that recorded the entire
thing were found inside his eye socket.

82
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,710
After countless request,

83
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:49,980
I was able to be left in charge
of this investigation half a year ago.

84
00:05:50,659 --> 00:05:55,450
The police decided to keep this a secret
to avoid commotion in the general public.

85
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,700
The name of the investigator is omitted.

86
00:05:57,730 --> 00:06:01,360
Even before this, the Tokyo Manji Gang
is primarily led by Tetta Kisaki.

87
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:08,110
Naoto is trying to teach me everything
he knows about the Tokyo Manji Gang.

88
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,640
But is this really necessary
to save Tachibana?

89
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:19,020
The issue with your ability is that you can
only go to the current date 12 years in the past.

90
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:22,350
That was just your theory, wasn't it?

91
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,160
But you're alive right now.

92
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:28,340
So what happens back then was real.

93
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:30,720
But how am I supposed to
back to the past again--

94
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:32,820
If you back to the day my sister died!

95
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:36,030
And stop her from going to
the festival by force,

96
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:38,440
we might be able to save her.

97
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:42,220
But since we can't choose
when in the past we can go,

98
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:44,580
we must do what we can do right now.

99
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,940
Please use the time leap,

100
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:50,150
go back to 12 years ago during
your middle school days,

101
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:51,840
and meet a certain person.

102
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:54,330
A certain person?

103
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:56,159
The two leaders of Toman.

104
00:06:56,159 --> 00:06:59,290
Manjiro Sano and Tetta Kisaki.

105
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:00,670
Scary.

106
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:02,590
Sano and Kisaki.

107
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:07,300
If these two hadn't met, the current
Tokyo Manji Gang wouldn't exist.

108
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:12,320
In other words, my sister wouldn't
get caught in their action and die.

109
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,030
I see.

110
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:16,230
So I have to go back to
my middle school days

111
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:18,680
and prevent them
from meeting each other.

112
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:23,440
I understand the plan, but how
do I get back to the past again?

113
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:28,020
Takemichi-kun, you told me you got back
when you shook hand with me, right?

114
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,690
Oh? Yeah.

115
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:32,060
That might be the trigger.

116
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:35,880
So it was that handshake?

117
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,730
That time, you saved me.

118
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:45,290
And because of that, I might
have become part of your power.

119
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,310
I see.

120
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,880
I thought he was some
kind of a crazy dude at first.

121
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:54,680
But he's this serious precisely because
he believes that I can leap through time.

122
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:56,810
Takemichi-kun.

123
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,100
Are you ready?

124
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,850
When it comes to the desire to
save Tachibana...

125
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:03,230
Yeah.

126
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:04,910
I won't lose to Naoto!

127
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:06,950
Sano and Kisaki.

128
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:10,010
They both met each other
in August, 12 years ago.

129
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:13,630
Get in contact with either one of them,
follow their movement,

130
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:15,380
and stop them from meeting each other.

131
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:18,280
Okay, I'll do my best.

132
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:24,960
You're the only one
who can save my sister.

133
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:41,950
Let's do this!

134
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:44,360
Eh? Where's Naoto?

135
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:48,960
Stop stallin' you idiot!

136
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:50,610
-Hurry up!
-Kill him!

137
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:51,990
Eh? Hold on...

138
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:54,070
Did you come here to eat breakfast?!

139
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:56,010
Don't put me to sleep, you dumbass!

140
00:08:57,290 --> 00:08:58,500
C'mon, do it!

141
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:02,700
Hanagaki, I bet 1000 yen on you!

142
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:06,210
What the heck is going on?!

143
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:07,380
Hold on a second!

144
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,160
(Wednesday, July 6th, 2005)

145
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,680
I'm in 12 years in the past!

146
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,650
It's just as Naoto said!

147
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,980
Wait, hold on--

148
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:20,510
I really leaped through time again.

149
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:25,500
Hey, Hanagaki is awake.

150
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:29,020
Did I pass out?

151
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:32,730
Why did you get knocked
out in one punch, dumbass?!

152
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,610
Everyone bet money on you.

153
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:37,520
Don't show us a lame-ass match like that.

154
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:39,070
Match?

155
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:40,830
Ain't that right, Kiyomasa?

156
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:49,050
That scar on his eyebrow.

157
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,060
The leader of Shibuya Third Mid.

158
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,840
Masataka Kiyomizu!

159
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:58,980
This underground fight is over
if there's no one to watch.

160
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,130
Underground fight?

161
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,830
I see.

162
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:05,050
People were betting money
on that fight.

163
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:06,820
I remember now.

164
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:09,560
These guys were a bookie.

165
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:14,100
For now, teach that piece of shit a lesson.

166
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,560
What are you, a freaking turtle?

167
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:19,860
Stand up, you shit!

168
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:21,290
I'll beat some guts out of you!

169
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:22,330
That's right!

170
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:25,470
I was their slave!

171
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:27,890
I was forced to do what they told me.

172
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:29,510
What the heck's wrong with this turtle?

173
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:31,990
Leave me some spot to hit too, Red.

174
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:33,350
There!

175
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,700
What a lame nerd!

176
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:44,650
They force me to fight some random guy.

177
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:46,850
And if I lose they will beat me up.

178
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,350
Every single day.

179
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:51,520
It was a living hell.

180
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:55,340
That's why I ran.

181
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,160
O-Ouch...

182
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:01,910
I abandoned my friends and
even my girlfriend, Tachibana.

183
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:07,670
Tachibana...

184
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:10,270
You better try a little harder next time.

185
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:11,830
You were so pathetic today.

186
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:13,740
Let's go.

187
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:15,100
Wanna eat some ramen?

188
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:16,450
Umm...

189
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:20,660
Man, you're persistent.
You're still awake?

190
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:22,360
Umm...

191
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:27,050
You guys are in
the Tokyo Manji Gang, right?

192
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:32,100
I'd like to meet the leaders,
like Sano or Kisaki...

193
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:35,540
So I wonder if you could help me out...

194
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:39,540
Ah, if that's not possible,
then that's okay.

195
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:48,150
Bring me my bat.

196
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:04,480
S-Sorr--

197
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:15,500
H-Hey, shouldn't we stop him now?

198
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:20,020
Kiyomasa! Stop it! He will die!

199
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,320
Wake up, Hanagaki.

200
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:41,030
The next time Sano-kun's name
comes out of your mouth...

201
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:43,180
Do you know what will happen?

202
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:44,780
I will kill you.

203
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,890
SCARY!!

204
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:51,760
What's wrong with this guy?!
You can't even talk with him!

205
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:54,090
It's impossible! I can't meet them!

206
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:57,170
He said he'll kill me if I say their name!
I'll seriously die at this rate!

207
00:12:57,190 --> 00:12:59,740
Is this guy seriously a middle schooler?

208
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:17,240
Meeting the leaders of the Tokyo Manji Gang?

209
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:19,060
A slave like me?

210
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:20,300
It's impossible!

211
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:23,180
It's impossible, Naoto!

212
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:27,450
I forgot.

213
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:29,750
I completely forgot.

214
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,510
I'm still me.

215
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:36,930
It won't change even in
my second chance at life.

216
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,550
Let's go back.

217
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:42,550
Back to the future.

218
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:47,210
How can I go back?

219
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,600
That's right.

220
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,910
Our handshake is the trigger.

221
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:56,200
I just have to meet Naoto.

222
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,670
Eh? Is no one at home?

223
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:08,050
It has to be Naoto.

224
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:11,560
As long I can shake my hand with
Naoto, I can return to the future.

225
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:15,710
You're the only one
who can save my sister.

226
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:20,660
Am I going to run away again?

227
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:24,350
Eh?

228
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:25,440
Hanagaki-kun?

229
00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:28,060
Tachibana? Why?

230
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:30,550
Why you ask?

231
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:32,130
That's my house.

232
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:36,140
I see.

233
00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:37,470
Well, of course--

234
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:39,210
Did you get in a fight again?

235
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:40,550
Sorry.

236
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,540
You look really bad today.

237
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:44,840
Are you okay?

238
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,300
Umm, yeah.

239
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:47,670
I'm totally fine.

240
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:53,720
Why do boys always get into a fight?

241
00:14:55,090 --> 00:14:56,960
If only I were a boy, too.

242
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,970
And then... Eiyah!

243
00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:06,390
I will protect you.

244
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:11,940
I trained in Karate, so if I were a boy,
I'd be really strong.

245
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:17,970
In that case...

246
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,570
I will also protect you, Hina.

247
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:21,970
Ah...

248
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,420
I accidentally called her Hina...

249
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:26,360
Okay!

250
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:29,130
Ah, well, I got caught in the moment...

251
00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:31,320
I like it that way.

252
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:41,610
But I'll be the one to protect you, okay?

253
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:42,470
What?

254
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:46,130
Because you're a crybaby, Takemichi-kun.

255
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:51,020
If I'm a boy, I'd definitely
be stronger than you.

256
00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:54,480
C'mon, that ain't true!

257
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:56,470
I only cried that one time, okay?

258
00:15:56,890 --> 00:15:57,900
Was it?

259
00:15:58,030 --> 00:15:59,390
Forget it!

260
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:01,210
No, I won't!

261
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:11,800
Bye bye! See you tomorrow.

262
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:13,340
Yeah!

263
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:17,580
I'm home!

264
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:47,250
In 12 years in the future...

265
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:52,770
I'm not dating Hina anymore,
and I haven't seen her in years.

266
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:59,310
I have no obligation to save Hina.

267
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:02,680
I will protect you.

268
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:05,450
But...

269
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:06,819
She...

270
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:11,109
She shouldn't die!

271
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:17,960
Takemichi!

272
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,630
Takuya?

273
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:22,940
Why did you lose to a guy like him?

274
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,859
That just ain't like you.

275
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,450
Eh? Aaah...

276
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:28,109
The yesterday's fight?

277
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:29,920
Sorry.

278
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:30,880
Hey.

279
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:34,010
Come here.

280
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:39,580
They said they will be doing
the underground fight again today.

281
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,710
They've been doing it nearly every day.

282
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:46,260
He said the fighter today is Takuya.

283
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:51,430
Takuya Yamamoto.

284
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:53,680
His body is weak.

285
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:56,970
If I remember correctly,
he nearly died that day.

286
00:17:57,870 --> 00:17:59,470
Takuya can't do it!

287
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,090
He's not good at fighting!

288
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:03,160
Say that to Kiyomasa-kun.

289
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:05,990
Can you do it?

290
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:10,740
If I could take his place, I would.

291
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,080
Akkun...

292
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:14,340
He tried to cover up for Takuya...

293
00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:17,370
They won't listen to what others say.

294
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:21,610
Akkun...

295
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:25,020
Thank you, Akkun.

296
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:26,820
I couldn't do anything.

297
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:29,080
Takemichi.

298
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:30,110
Eh?

299
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:32,380
Watch me.

300
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:35,190
I will avenge you.

301
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:38,950
Treat me some gyudon if I win.

302
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,120
Takuya...

303
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:43,580
Dammit!

304
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:48,120
Anyway, keep your spirit up, okay?

305
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:49,710
Yeah, I know.

306
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:51,120
Do your best, Takuya--

307
00:18:51,290 --> 00:18:52,920
Wash your hand first, Magishi.

308
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:57,600
That was close.
I nearly touch you like that.

309
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:04,920
I thought they were lame.

310
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:07,020
But they're actually very cool.

311
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:12,050
So I had such great friends like
them back in middle school.

312
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:15,160
-Let's go!
-Yeah!

313
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:17,050
Don't be too tense or
you will fart yourself.

314
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:18,460
That's just you.

315
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,380
Takemichi, hurry up.

316
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:21,920
Ah, yeah.

317
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:32,420
Greetings to all gentlemen
who have gathered here!

318
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:36,200
The competitors today are
just as it said in the email!

319
00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:38,190
We have Kojima from Sakura Mid!

320
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:39,370
Yeah~!

321
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,260
Don't "Yeah" us you dumbass!

322
00:19:41,290 --> 00:19:43,010
Don't you get carried away, baldy!

323
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:45,200
If you lose I'll make you go
home in your underwear!

324
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:47,930
And Yamamoto from Mizo Mid!

325
00:19:47,930 --> 00:19:49,510
Die, you long haired bastard!

326
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:51,080
Don't piss your pants, you shit!

327
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,130
The odds are 4 to 6 slightly
in Kojima's favor.

328
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,220
Give it your all, Yamada!

329
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:57,560
It's Yamamoto.

330
00:19:57,590 --> 00:19:59,290
I bet 500 yen on ya!

331
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:03,400
If ya lose, I'll be bankrupt!
Don't ya dare to lose, dumbass!

332
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:22,330
Alright, come on.
I'll chop you into three pieces.

333
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:32,390
Begin.

334
00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:36,820
WAIT--!!!

335
00:20:43,770 --> 00:20:45,970
T...Takemichi?!

336
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,360
The heck are you doing?

337
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:49,330
Who's this guy?

338
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,340
2nd year should just shut the hell up!

339
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:53,220
Huh? 2nd year?

340
00:20:56,040 --> 00:21:01,130
Well, ain't it boring to watch the same
type of match every single time?

341
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:03,690
Don't cha want to watch
something more interesting?

342
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:06,030
Didn't you get your ass beaten
in one punch yesterday?

343
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:07,180
Get outta here, you buffoon!

344
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:10,400
Something more interesting?

345
00:21:12,050 --> 00:21:13,730
I have to fight.

346
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:16,600
F-For example...

347
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:18,590
I mustn't run away.

348
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:22,120
Who the hell are you?
Don't get in our way!

349
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:23,180
H-Hey...

350
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,550
Takemichi...

351
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:29,250
King versus slave.

352
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:31,650
Hey hey hey, this guy is nuts!

353
00:21:31,670 --> 00:21:33,640
The heck is he saying?

354
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:36,020
What do you mean by that?

355
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:37,610
Takemichi...

356
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,520
Could he be...

357
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,670
Kiyomasa-senpai.

358
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:55,210
Fight me one-on-one.

359
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:02,130
Both in the past and the future.

360
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:05,600
I have to change myself, or else,
I can't change anything.

361
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:09,460
I won't run anymore!

362
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:26,630
I just want to be right next to you

363
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:29,890
Next to your slightly sweaty shirt

364
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:35,430
The rain falls all of the sudden

365
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:38,980
So I gave you a kiss in that lonely night

366
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:48,900
If you look back, I will always
be there and smiling at you

367
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,660
Please

368
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:57,160
Give up on that unachievable future

369
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:59,540
Take it now

370
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:01,580
In the real new world

371
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:06,380
If I have to give you a name,
it's "My Hero"

372
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:08,420
That straight wish

373
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:10,760
Will go beyond the stopped time

374
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:15,600
"I don't need anyone but you"

375
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:23,150
I will keep living here

376
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:31,820
Break down that crooked needle

377
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:34,070
Shout out that firm words

378
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:36,790
Kick away that unmeaning destiny
