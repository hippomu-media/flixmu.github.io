1
00:00:01,790 --> 00:00:03,870
I didn't know.

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:06,930
That you're on death row.

3
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:09,420
What happened?!

4
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:11,760
Why did you commit murder?

5
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:16,210
If I can really redo my life
one more time...

6
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:21,410
I'd kill Kisaki!

7
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:23,530
Naoto.

8
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:26,840
Just what kind of guy is Kisaki?

9
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:29,440
Tetta Kisaki.

10
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:31,570
In the current Tokyo Manji Gang,

11
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:35,110
he holds one of the most important
position as acting president.

12
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:40,140
He's likely the one responsible
for the repeated murder of my sister.

13
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:43,880
The police are pouring all their
effort into the investigation,

14
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:46,000
but we can't find any lead.

15
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,130
Naoto.

16
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,720
As I thought, there's only one way.

17
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:58,780
I will become the top member of Toman!

18
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:02,510
If I become the top member of Toman,
I can stop Kisaki.

19
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:05,780
I can also protect everyone including
Draken, Mikey, and Hina.

20
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:09,020
Our old ways was not good enough.

21
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:10,450
We must go to the root.

22
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:13,700
I understand.

23
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,430
I trust you.

24
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:19,660
Yeah.

25
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:31,640
'Bout time.

26
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:37,490
Takemicchi, let's go.

27
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:42,710
To the new 3rd squad captain
nomination ceremony.

28
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:44,320
Eh?!

29
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:51,110
We got our collars grabbed
and took an intense punch

30
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:56,020
After we got beaten up
Together we crouched

31
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:58,440
The anticipated rain came

32
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:06,780
"This should clean your bruise"
you lied with a smile

33
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:14,780
Even though you're bad at argument

34
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:20,000
So stop making such lame jokes

35
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,130
It's so bad I teared up

36
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:32,720
Getting blue bruises all the time
I cry, cry, and cry

37
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:39,390
Leaning our unstable heart together

38
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:44,060
We fight against the rotten Bad End

39
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:45,820
I wonder why

40
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:53,950
The pleasant pain was more vivid,
even more than the happiness

41
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:58,579
Clicking our tongue over our wet clothes

42
00:02:58,579 --> 00:03:01,960
We look at each other's faces and laugh

43
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:14,140
The Revenge we swore in that rainy night

44
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:51,430
Good work!

45
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:18,880
We will now begin the Tokyo Manji Gang
3rd squad captain nomination ceremony!

46
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:23,210
3rd squad captain nomination ceremony!

47
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:25,570
Who do you think will be nominated?

48
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,970
-Peh-yan?
-That can't be.

49
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:31,390
You think the guy who attacked
Draken-kun gets to be a captain?

50
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:32,850
Hell nah.

51
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:34,600
Then who?!

52
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,860
How the heck am I supposed to know?

53
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:38,680
No main candidate?

54
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:41,280
Could it be...

55
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,290
No, that can't be.

56
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:46,430
3rd squad captain!

57
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:48,020
Step forward!

58
00:04:49,909 --> 00:04:51,080
Eh?

59
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:54,460
Did Mikey-kun just... call me?

60
00:04:56,010 --> 00:04:57,670
-Who?
-Dunno.

61
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:00,790
-Let's go.
-Yes!

62
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:08,070
Outta the way!

63
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:18,230
He's the new 3rd squad captain?

64
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:21,500
The big one? The small one?

65
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:28,190
Well, of course it's not me.

66
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:34,800
Eh?

67
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:56,850
I've seen him before.

68
00:05:56,850 --> 00:05:58,100
Who was it?

69
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:12,760
-Hey!
-Is he serious?

70
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:16,380
That bastard, is he fooling around?

71
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,520
What's up with him?

72
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:20,180
Is he for real?

73
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:22,840
He just sat while showing
his back to the President!

74
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,200
The heck's wrong with you?!

75
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:27,430
Hey you, don't act like you're hot shit!

76
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:35,060
Hey, is he not going to say anything?

77
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:37,230
The heck is his deal?

78
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,190
You guys listen up!

79
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:41,940
This person sitting behind me!

80
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:44,320
He's the new 3rd squad captain!

81
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,360
Tetta Kisaki!

82
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,820
(Tokyo Manji Gang 3rd Squad Captain
- Tetta Kisaki)

83
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:53,840
I'm scared.

84
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:57,520
I'm simply too scared of Kisaki.

85
00:06:58,170 --> 00:07:00,170
I'd kill Kisaki!

86
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:03,890
Kisaki's behind everything.

87
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,650
This guy is Kisaki?!

88
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:13,750
The real Kisaki is now right
in front of me?!

89
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:15,930
What should I do?

90
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:17,510
What should I do?!

91
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:20,560
I've seen him before!

92
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:22,400
Isn't he from Moebius?

93
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:24,440
Kisaki's from Moebius?

94
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,900
What's a Moebius doing here?!

95
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:28,940
Get the heck out of here, Moebius!

96
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:30,650
Yeah, get out!

97
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:35,100
Get out!

98
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,690
Get out!

99
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:38,200
Get out!

100
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:39,720
Get out!

101
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:41,350
Get out!

102
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:42,080
Get out--

103
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:45,310
Shut up! It's Mikey's decision!

104
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:48,140
If you got a problem with that,
step forward!

105
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:58,350
Our gang will soon clash with Valhalla!

106
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:04,270
Valhalla is a raising power,
way bigger than Moebius ever was!

107
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:07,160
To beat them, Toman will have
to be more powerful as well!

108
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:10,280
That's why we have Tetta Kisaki here.

109
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:13,490
He's the man in charge of the guys
from our generation in Moebius.

110
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:17,650
We need Kisaki to win against Valhalla!

111
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:21,330
The 3rd squad captain is Tetta Kisaki!

112
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,520
Remember that!

113
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:28,160
This concludes the 3rd squad captain
nomination ceremony!

114
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:36,720
Crap! This is the worst
possible situation!

115
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:40,929
Kisaki joined Toman and immediately
became a captain?!

116
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:48,450
President!

117
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,900
Thank you very much!

118
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:02,820
Yeah.

119
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:14,490
Just what is he thinking?

120
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:16,760
Our president.

121
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:21,680
Let's go home.

122
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,780
Yes!

123
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:30,130
Dammit!

124
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:34,370
At this rate, Hina will once again...

125
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:57,170
What are you doing, Takemicchi?!

126
00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:03,140
Hey, what is he doing?

127
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:05,890
-Isn't this bad?
-The managers will kill him!

128
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,060
Hey, who the heck are you?!

129
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:12,480
Crap!

130
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,830
I did it!

131
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,850
You're not even from Toman,
what are you doing?!

132
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,980
Are you trying to crush
this nomination ceremony?!

133
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:23,120
Draken-kun...

134
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:26,960
N-No...

135
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,550
What do you mean?! Takemicchi!

136
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:32,900
Hey, you.

137
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:36,380
Are you trying to ruin Mikey's
reputation here?

138
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:41,470
E-Everyone, you got the wrong idea.

139
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:46,220
I... I just...!

140
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,060
Hey, hey, what's going on?

141
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:56,110
Looks like this is getting interesting.

142
00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:57,630
Baji...

143
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,740
Shouldn't you be on house arrest?

144
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:02,660
Eh? Baji?

145
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:03,790
Who?!

146
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:17,800
Baji.

147
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,200
Stop it.

148
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,550
Let go, Mitsuya.

149
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:22,840
I might kill you.

150
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:25,590
Just what do you want to do?

151
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:34,310
Mikey!

152
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,630
What are you doing here, Baji?

153
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:41,350
You've been banned from our
gatherings for causing that infight.

154
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:45,420
I just punched another lame brat.

155
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:47,370
Eh?

156
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:51,250
Since I ruined your precious gathering,

157
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:53,490
will you finally throw me out this time?

158
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:56,950
What? What is this guy talking about?

159
00:11:58,090 --> 00:11:59,270
Baji...

160
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:02,130
I'm joining Valhalla.

161
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:08,260
You don't need troublemaker, right?

162
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,460
Mikey.

163
00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:11,200
Baji!

164
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,160
I quit.

165
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:23,360
From now on, Keisuke Baji,
the 1st squad captain...

166
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,270
...will be Toman's enemy!

167
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:34,810
1st squad captain?

168
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:48,340
Toman's falling apart.

169
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:53,730
Baji...

170
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,960
Don't mind him, Mikey.

171
00:12:58,150 --> 00:13:00,400
He's that kind of guy.

172
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:03,400
Yeah...

173
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:10,370
Hey, Takemicchi.

174
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:14,660
Face or stomach, which do you prefer?

175
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:16,330
Eh? As in what?

176
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:18,500
I recommend face.

177
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:19,890
Which one?

178
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,010
T-Then stoma--

179
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:31,430
You tighten up your stomach, didn't you?

180
00:13:56,290 --> 00:13:57,790
Ouch...

181
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:00,590
I see...

182
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:03,620
Kisaki punched me.

183
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:08,110
Why did I attack him?

184
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:11,600
Kisaki is the 3rd squad captain.

185
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:17,250
I said I will become
the top member of Toman.

186
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:19,480
But is it impossible now?

187
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:22,820
Eh?

188
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:26,150
You awake?

189
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:28,460
M-Mikey-kun?

190
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:33,860
Why is he here?

191
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:36,290
Takemicchi.

192
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:38,750
You don't like Kisaki?

193
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:41,290
Eh... well...

194
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:42,590
Umm...

195
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:51,970
It sure is hard to make
your organization bigger.

196
00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:56,980
Just when we welcomed new people,
some became to quit.

197
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:08,530
The road to achieve the dream is long.

198
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,590
Mikey-kun...

199
00:15:13,530 --> 00:15:16,030
I have a favor for you, Takemicchi.

200
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:18,770
Yes.

201
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,460
I've got this childhood friend.

202
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:24,590
Yes?

203
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:29,070
But we were just neighbors,
not particularly close or anything.

204
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:31,920
Mikey-kun's childhood friend?

205
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:34,760
I bet he's one crazy dude.

206
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:37,930
He would always pick a fight with me.

207
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:40,390
And I beat him up every time.

208
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,480
He kept trying to fight you
over and over?!

209
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:45,110
Doesn't sound like a smart guy.

210
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:46,320
Yeah.

211
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,820
That's the guy who punched you earlier.

212
00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:53,130
I got punched by two guys,
so which one?

213
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:56,930
The 1st squad captain.

214
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,770
Keisuke Baji.

215
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:07,230
You just can't tell what
he's thinking, right?

216
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:08,750
Yeah.

217
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:11,470
I don't even know why he punched me.

218
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:15,050
He's always been like that.

219
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:18,100
He would punch people he met
just because he was sleepy.

220
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:21,270
And he would put a car on fire
when he was hungry.

221
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:22,980
E-Eeehh...

222
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,550
That's a level beyond common
comprehension.

223
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,940
Anyway, even a guy like him.

224
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:33,170
He's still one of Toman's founding members.

225
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:35,740
The founding members?

226
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:40,120
I started Toman in my first
year of middle school.

227
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:46,170
Along with Draken, Mitsuya,
Pah-chin, and Baji.

228
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:53,220
With those five?

229
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:55,350
Yeah.

230
00:16:56,680 --> 00:17:00,820
We gathered and made this gang together.

231
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:06,589
Takemicchi.

232
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:10,069
Bring Baji back from Valhalla for me.

233
00:17:10,819 --> 00:17:13,960
I really like that guy.

234
00:17:16,569 --> 00:17:18,190
Can you do that for me?

235
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,329
Yes!

236
00:17:20,329 --> 00:17:22,500
If it's for you, of course!

237
00:17:25,869 --> 00:17:26,990
But...

238
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:31,340
Can I also ask just one thing from you?

239
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:33,640
Nnn? What is it?

240
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,060
Kisaki...

241
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:39,760
That guy...

242
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,750
Please expel him from Toman!

243
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:45,110
Hah?

244
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:49,360
Why did you let a guy
like him join Toman?

245
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:53,480
I can't explain why,
but he's a bad news!

246
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,780
He...

247
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:56,440
Kisaki...

248
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:59,390
He'll surely ruin Toman in the future!

249
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:03,620
There is no way he'll understand
no matter how I explain it.

250
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:11,420
Okay.

251
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:13,410
Eh? Really?!

252
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:16,870
We will clash with Valhalla soon enough.

253
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:20,600
Your job is to get Baji back before then.

254
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:24,180
Prove that you're more useful than Kisaki.

255
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:29,600
I can also tell that
Kisaki is a dangerous guy.

256
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:33,440
But at the same time,
I acknowledge his strength.

257
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:38,300
Toman needs Kisaki's strength
to move forward.

258
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,970
Contribute something for me, Takemicchi.

259
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:45,700
That's my condition.

260
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:47,050
And if you fail...

261
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:49,250
I will kill you.

262
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,750
Mitsuya!

263
00:18:57,050 --> 00:18:59,380
What've you been
eavesdropping on us for?

264
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,300
C'mon out.

265
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:04,390
I can see your silver hair peeking
out from behind the tree!

266
00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:07,380
You got me.

267
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:11,650
I was looking for the toilet
and heard you guys talking.

268
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:13,830
Mitsuya-kun...

269
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:17,510
That's right, perfect timing.

270
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:19,030
Mitsuya.

271
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:22,450
I've decided to put Takemicchi
to your 2nd squad.

272
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:23,530
Eh?

273
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:24,560
Huh?

274
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,580
Takemicchi.

275
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:29,810
You're now an official member of Toman.

276
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,410
Welcome aboard.

277
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,180
I'm excited to work with you!

278
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:40,970
Why'd I even eavesdrop on them...

279
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:43,740
Let's go back now.

280
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:44,760
Okay.

281
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:48,520
I'll go home after I wash off my blood,
so please go without me.

282
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:16,710
Come to think of it, I wasn't
a member of Toman until now.

283
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:20,970
And I told Naoto that I was going
to be the top member of Toman,

284
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:22,600
how embarrassing.

285
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:24,250
But...

286
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,530
I've got a goal now, Naoto.

287
00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:34,060
If I can just bring Baji-kun back,
I might be able to get Kisaki out of Toman.

288
00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:35,920
Eh?

289
00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:40,360
Why did Baji-kun even quit
Toman in the first place?

290
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:49,790
A good luck charm?

291
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,580
Did someone drop this?

292
00:20:56,690 --> 00:20:57,700
What's this?

293
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:00,160
A photo?

294
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:06,150
It's Mikey-kun and Draken-kun!

295
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:07,780
They look so young!

296
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:10,040
There's Mitsuya-kun.

297
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:12,400
And Pah-chin-kun too.

298
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:14,520
Baji-kun...

299
00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:17,440
Could this be the photo
of the founding members?

300
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:20,860
Feels like I just picked up
something super important.

301
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:25,850
One, two, three, four, five...

302
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:28,200
There's six of them.

303
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:31,120
I thought there were supposed
to be just five founding members.

304
00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:36,090
This guy who looks really
close with Baji-kun...

305
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:39,210
He has a tattoo on his neck.

306
00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:40,590
Who's this?

307
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,100
Long time no see.

308
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:03,110
Kazutora.

309
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:21,710
A sword is perfect for
an earnest fella like you

310
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:25,330
You're a hero with no fire

311
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:29,490
You are weak and powerless
in front of a gun

312
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:32,890
It's not something to take lightly

313
00:22:32,910 --> 00:22:37,400
Just try it, just try it, just try it

314
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:40,100
There is no correct answer

315
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:40,980
Mayday

316
00:22:41,010 --> 00:22:44,300
Just a no no,
for a lazy lazy head

317
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:47,940
Look, for a fast and furious
Be-bop lifestyle

318
00:22:47,970 --> 00:22:51,240
Stagnate, daydream, it's bad no no NO

319
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:55,830
An obvious pray to god,
bye bye to next life

320
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:08,630
Your number of excuse is wonder

321
00:23:08,670 --> 00:23:11,600
Vomiting prejudice and urge

322
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:14,790
Most emotions are soda

323
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:16,970
Say it

324
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:20,770
Just a no no,
for a lazy lazy head

325
00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:24,450
Look, for a fast and furious
Be-bop lifestyle

326
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:28,990
Stagnate, daydream, it's bad no no NO

327
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:32,670
Goodbye bye bye to next life
