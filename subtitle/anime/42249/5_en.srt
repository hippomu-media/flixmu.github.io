1
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:07,060
We got our collars grabbed
and took an intense punch

2
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:11,940
After we got beaten up
Together we crouched

3
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:14,360
The anticipated rain came

4
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:22,700
"This should clean your bruise"
you lied with a smile

5
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:30,700
Even though you're bad at argument

6
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:35,920
So stop making such lame jokes

7
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:41,050
It's so bad I teared up

8
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:48,640
Getting blue bruises all the time
I cry, cry, and cry

9
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:55,310
Leaning our unstable heart together

10
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:59,980
We fight against the rotten Bad End

11
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:01,740
I wonder why

12
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:09,870
The pleasant pain was more vivid,
even more than the happiness

13
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:14,500
Clicking our tongue over our wet clothes

14
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:17,880
We look at each other's face and laugh

15
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:30,060
The Revenge we swore in that rainy night

16
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:35,340
Takemichi Hanagaki-kun?

17
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:37,750
You're fired.

18
00:01:38,259 --> 00:01:39,259
Eh?

19
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:41,840
Don't give me "Eh," it's obvious.

20
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:43,940
You missed work for two weeks
without permission.

21
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:48,610
And who do you think
took the flank for that?

22
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:49,750
I-I'm sorr--

23
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:51,710
You're fired.

24
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:53,600
I see.

25
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:55,610
Two weeks has passed.

26
00:01:56,229 --> 00:02:00,410
When time passed in the past,
the same goes for the present.

27
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,070
Um, what about my wages--

28
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:04,950
It will be sent to your bank account.

29
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:10,789
Hey, Naoto.

30
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:15,150
At this point, why don't we just
tell the past Hina about the future?

31
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:16,810
Just like I did with you--

32
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:17,980
Denied.

33
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:21,070
Takemichi-kun, are you trying
to just phone it in?

34
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:23,079
No, that's not my intention!

35
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:26,990
It's not that I want to take it easy
because it put a strain on my livelihood.

36
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:32,020
And what will you do if my sister
think you're crazy because of that?

37
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:35,980
People normally wouldn't
trust something like that.

38
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:37,150
Are you stupid?

39
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:42,820
I only believed you because I just happened
to be hooked in the occult at the time.

40
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,160
Yeah, you were awfully sharp about it.

41
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:49,040
But do you have to call me
stupid for that?

42
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:52,800
Sendo is dead and we can't
meet up with Sano anymore.

43
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:57,730
In the end, our only way to save my sister
is to return to the past and change Toman.

44
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:00,670
So we're back to square one.

45
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,880
If only Draken is still alive...

46
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,050
You're talking about Ken Ryuguji?

47
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:09,420
Yeah.

48
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,380
You looked him up for me?

49
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,680
Yes.

50
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,230
This is the newspaper from that time.

51
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,150
On August 3rd, 2005,

52
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:22,560
in a parking lot in Musashi shrine,
at Tokyo's Shibuya-ku,

53
00:03:22,579 --> 00:03:24,780
50 people from a Bosozoku had a brawl.

54
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:27,350
A 15 years old middle
school student passed away

55
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:31,310
after being stabbed in
the abdomen with a knife.

56
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:36,750
I found some posts on the internet
at the time of the incident.

57
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,420
According to those posts,

58
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:42,050
Ryuguji passed away
due to the infight

59
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:44,640
between the Mikey faction and
Draken faction of Toman.

60
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,980
Huh? Hold on a second!

61
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:50,250
August 3rd?
That's 2 weeks from now!

62
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,600
Yes, 12 years ago.

63
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:56,640
Mikey and Draken get into a fight?
There got to be a mistake!

64
00:03:58,010 --> 00:04:01,360
Draken knows Mikey more
than anyone else!

65
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,450
Anyway, that's impossible!

66
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,410
So there's something behind this?

67
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:08,740
Eh? W-Well, I don't know.

68
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:11,340
But I'm sure that it's impossible!

69
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:15,360
But Ryuguji certainly died that day.

70
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:18,320
Let's look into it.

71
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,870
Today is July 19th.

72
00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:22,870
The deadline is 2 weeks from now on.

73
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:28,310
You must find the reason behind his death
and save Ken Ryuguji on August 3rd.

74
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:30,850
That's your mission this time.

75
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:34,760
Manjiro Sano who has changed
because of Ryuguji's death.

76
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:38,620
Atsushi Sendo who was afraid of
Tetta Kisaki and committed suicide.

77
00:04:39,409 --> 00:04:43,240
And Hinata Tachibana who was
killed by the current evil Toman.

78
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:44,870
My sister...

79
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:49,830
If this mission is successful,
you could save them all!

80
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:53,770
Draken, Akkun, and Hina...

81
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:55,340
Yes!

82
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:57,580
That's awesome!

83
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,010
I'll definitely save Draken!

84
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:04,470
I'm counting on you.

85
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:15,210
Huh?

86
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,190
So dark.

87
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:21,800
Something heavy is on me.

88
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:27,920
No kissing.

89
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:30,120
Eh?

90
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:33,050
What is this situation?!

91
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:35,300
No kissing?

92
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:38,750
Then what other stuff is on the menu?!

93
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,850
Yes? I'd like a 30 minute extension.

94
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:52,790
Do you want something to drink?

95
00:05:53,909 --> 00:05:54,980
Eh?

96
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,080
What the hell?!
What's going on?!

97
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:05,910
It's completely different
from my previous life!

98
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:09,300
An eternal virgin like me being
together with such a cute girl?

99
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:12,630
I must not let Hina know about this.

100
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:13,540
About what?

101
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:19,380
Hina?! W-Why are you here?

102
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:21,010
I'm on my way home from cram school.

103
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,330
And what are you doing here,
Takemichi-kun?

104
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:25,250
Well! Erm, actually...

105
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:30,770
W-What?

106
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,550
Do I have something on my face?

107
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:36,930
C-Could it be...

108
00:06:38,909 --> 00:06:40,340
She figured it out?!

109
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:44,480
U-Um, I actually don't have
any memory about that!

110
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:46,090
What are you talking about?

111
00:06:48,159 --> 00:06:50,990
Takemichi-kun, you're acting
weird recently.

112
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:51,880
Eh?

113
00:06:51,909 --> 00:06:53,830
You're the "adult Takemichi-kun" today.

114
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:58,060
Like in that day we watched
fireworks together on the rooftop.

115
00:06:58,090 --> 00:06:59,870
You suddenly panicked and went home.

116
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,590
And you also gave me
the cold attitude at school.

117
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:05,950
And yet, you're making
gentle expression today.

118
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:08,360
I see...

119
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:13,890
When I returned to the present, what's
left here is the past me who knows nothing.

120
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:19,890
No kissing.

121
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,760
Just what leads me to that situation?

122
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,980
The past me is so dumb!

123
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:27,420
Takemichi-kun, your phone is ringing.

124
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:28,510
Hmm?

125
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:29,510
Yeah.

126
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,220
Oh! Draken-kun!

127
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:34,960
Hello?

128
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,570
Takemicchi, what are
you doing right now?

129
00:07:37,909 --> 00:07:39,800
Well, right now I'm...

130
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:41,550
Come to Musashi shrine now.

131
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,000
Everyone will be there.

132
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:45,400
Eh? But right now...

133
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:51,220
Hina, Draken-kun wants
me to meet up with him.

134
00:07:51,890 --> 00:07:53,500
I'll go too, then!

135
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:55,060
Seriously?

136
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:57,540
He's your friend, right?

137
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,160
Takemichi-kun.

138
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,320
Hm?

139
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:10,660
What is the thing that's important to you?

140
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:12,760
Eh? Important?

141
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:18,230
For me, it's times like these.

142
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:20,140
When we don't have to do anything.

143
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:25,280
When we walk together and
talk about random stuff.

144
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:28,270
The time I can be with you like this.

145
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:32,419
I want to have a lot of time like that.

146
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:34,159
Time...

147
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:35,500
That's right.

148
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:38,539
What's important to me is to save Hina.

149
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:42,020
To save Hina who gets killed
by Toman in the future!

150
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:47,270
You guys are meeting up here?

151
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:48,630
Yeah.

152
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:00,690
Is this really the place?

153
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:01,930
Y-Yeah...

154
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:08,470
They look scary.

155
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:10,750
I-It will be fine!

156
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:12,050
I'm here with you.

157
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:14,600
But you mustn't stare at them too much.

158
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:17,410
A Tokko-fuku at this day and age?

159
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,000
And so many of them.

160
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:20,370
Hey!

161
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:24,780
This ain't a freaking exhibition!
Get the hell outta here!

162
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:27,950
What the crap do you want?!

163
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:29,460
Want us to kill you, dimwit?!

164
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,710
W-We're just here because
someone called us.

165
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:36,170
Huh? Do you even know
what place this is, you imbecile?!

166
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,930
M-Musashi shrine...

167
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:41,630
Who the heck told you to come to
a Toman meeting place, huh?!

168
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:43,160
I oppose violence!

169
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:47,100
(Tokyo Manji Gang Captain of the 2nd Squad - Takashi Mitsuya)

170
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:49,450
Could you be Takemicchi?
(Tokyo Manji Gang Captain of the 2nd Squad - Takashi Mitsuya)

171
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:51,280
Y-Yes.

172
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:55,060
Why are you scaring President's guest?

173
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:56,910
I-I'm sorry!

174
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,890
Are you okay, Takemichi-kun?

175
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:01,970
Yeah.

176
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,370
Follow me.

177
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:04,490
Eh?

178
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:05,890
Ah, yeah.

179
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:11,790
Yo, Takemicchi.

180
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:16,020
Sorry for calling you all of the sudden.

181
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:19,450
Why are you bringing your wife along?

182
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:21,160
I'm sorry.

183
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:23,610
I had no idea it was gonna be like this.

184
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:25,060
Oh, Hina-chan.

185
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:27,560
Sorry for scaring you last time.

186
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:28,780
It's alright.

187
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:30,380
I'm completely fine.

188
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:33,810
And also, I'm sorry for
what I did last time.

189
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:35,740
Hey, Emma!

190
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,880
Comin'!

191
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:40,390
This girl is Takemicchi's wife,
so you better protect her.

192
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,330
Roger~

193
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,390
Yo, lil' coward!

194
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:54,450
Lil' coward? What is this about?

195
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:57,120
What? You knew Emma?

196
00:10:57,370 --> 00:10:59,310
I-It's not what it seems, Hina!

197
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:02,520
Draken-kun, I seriously
don't remember a thing!

198
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,660
He saw me in my underwear
and ran away.

199
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:09,930
Oooh? So something like
that happened, huh?

200
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,950
Did it really happen?

201
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:14,820
I seriously have no memory of it!

202
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:17,360
Eh?! Hina-san?!

203
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:23,490
I'm very sorry.

204
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:25,160
Don't care!

205
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:30,470
So you had a girl like that,
yet you still took a swing at me.

206
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:32,430
But don't get the wrong idea.

207
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:35,590
I don't have any feeling about
you or anything.

208
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:36,740
Eh?

209
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:40,570
I just wanted to become
an adult quickly.

210
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:44,460
He didn't care about me at all.

211
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:47,350
All he thinks about is fighting,
bike, and being with Mikey.

212
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:51,010
I thought he would at
least get a little angry.

213
00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:53,230
I see.

214
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:56,300
So she wanted Draken-kun to feel jealous.

215
00:11:56,840 --> 00:12:00,150
At any rate, a woman's heart is a mystery.

216
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,550
Takemicchi.

217
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:03,530
Are you done?

218
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:05,580
Sorry for keeping you waiting.

219
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:08,050
You guys, gather around!

220
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,810
It's time for the meeting!

221
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:13,680
Good work, President!

222
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,590
Amazing.

223
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:49,690
The atmosphere changed just from
Mikey standing in front of everyone.

224
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:53,350
So this is... the president of Toman!

225
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:56,750
We're gathered here to talk about Moebius.

226
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:59,630
If both of us clashes,
it will be a big dispute.

227
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:01,250
Moebius?

228
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:03,320
What dispute?

229
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:04,950
I didn't hear anything about this!

230
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:06,590
Now then,

231
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,900
I want to hear what you all think.

232
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:13,060
Ouch...

233
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:14,170
What are you doing--

234
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:18,970
You got a problem?

235
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:21,080
You're Hanagaki, right?

236
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:22,100
(Tokyo Manji Gang Vice-Captain of the 3rd Squad - Peh-yan)

237
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:26,420
So ya took care of Kiyomasa
from our squad, didn't ya?

238
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,600
(Tokyo Manji Gang Captain of the 3rd Squad - Pah-chin)

239
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:30,010
How are ya planning
to pay for the losses?

240
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:32,570
L-Losses?

241
00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:34,520
Cut it out, Pah.

242
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:39,280
We all agreed that Kiyomasa just
used Toman's name without permission

243
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:42,480
to start some silly underground
fights on his own, didn't we?

244
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:46,440
I'm dumb so I ain't gonna
know about stuff like that!

245
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:49,360
Pah-chin's brain is
pitifully small, you know!

246
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,570
If you don't know then
don't butt in, dumbass!

247
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:53,200
Hey, Pah.

248
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:55,550
Shut up.

249
00:13:56,490 --> 00:13:57,900
Sorry, Draken!

250
00:13:58,510 --> 00:13:59,510
Tch.

251
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:05,260
Forgive 'em, Takemicchi.

252
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:07,860
Pah is on edge right now.

253
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:11,590
He sure is absurd.

254
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:14,970
His bud had a fight with Moebius.

255
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:17,560
That's what started this dispute.

256
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:18,460
Eh?

257
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,750
What happened?

258
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:24,660
A small thing happened with
the Moebius leader called Osanai.

259
00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:29,290
Pah's bud got beaten up
by those in Moebius.

260
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:33,690
They raped his girlfriend in front
of him and took all of his possession.

261
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:36,620
They even beat up his parents
and sibling later on.

262
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,260
How awful...

263
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:42,210
Moebius is that type of gang.

264
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:45,880
They're two generations older than us
and currently controlling Shinjuku.

265
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:46,960
Eh?

266
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:49,260
I thought Toman is the one
who controlled this area.

267
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:52,720
Toman controls Shibuya,
but Shinjuku is a different story.

268
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,460
Not to mention,
we're still just a new gang.

269
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:57,010
I see.

270
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,470
There's still a bigger gang out there
than Toman back in this era.

271
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,430
What will you do, Pah?

272
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,730
Do you wanna do it?

273
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:10,660
They're two generation older than us.

274
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:16,040
And Toman wouldn't get away unscratched.

275
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:18,700
It will cause trouble for everyone.

276
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,580
But...!

277
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:25,150
It's so frustrating, Mikey!

278
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:27,180
That's not what I'm asking.

279
00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:29,260
You wanna do it?

280
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:31,510
or not?

281
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:35,250
I wanna do it!

282
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:37,620
I want to beat them to death!

283
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:40,020
-That's what I thought.
-Eh?

284
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:49,710
Anyone here thinks it's too much
hassle to help out Pah's friend?

285
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:55,500
Anyone here stays chilled even though
Moebius beat up Pah's friend?!

286
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:58,840
Surely you're not, right?!

287
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:07,150
We're going to crush Moebius!

288
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:12,700
On August 3rd, during Musashi festival,
we're going for battle!

289
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:20,570
August 3rd?

290
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:25,080
Save Ken Ryuguji on August 3rd!

291
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:27,540
It's the day Draken dies!

292
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:31,650
Naoto said that on August 3rd,

293
00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:34,020
in an infight between
Mikey faction and Draken faction,

294
00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:35,940
Draken will die.

295
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:39,500
But, now I get back in time 12 years ago...

296
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:42,800
it turns out a fight between Toman
and Moebius is about to start.

297
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,670
That means...

298
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:49,930
I'm too stupid to figure this out!

299
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:52,730
I've got it, Naoto!

300
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:57,320
I will become Draken's bodyguard!

301
00:16:57,780 --> 00:17:00,970
Okay! It's a genius idea,
if I do say so myself!

302
00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:02,370
Bodyguard?

303
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:03,740
No way.

304
00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:04,930
Thank you!

305
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:07,730
Eh? What did you say?

306
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:10,270
Having a bodyguard would be annoying.

307
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:12,319
Besides, what help can you do anyway?

308
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:14,240
You don't have to say it like that...

309
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,490
Mission failed before it even started.

310
00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:20,829
But I'm not the type who
would give up so easily!

311
00:17:20,829 --> 00:17:22,900
Time for Plan B! I'll tail him!

312
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,740
What the heck is this?

313
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:28,020
Is it a fight?

314
00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:29,880
I'll never forgive this!

315
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:30,780
Huh?!

316
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,580
Is this the start of their fight?

317
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:34,680
There's no flag!

318
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:39,180
Eh?

319
00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:42,720
I got the kid's meal because
I was excited about the flag!

320
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,570
I'm sorry, I'll bring it right away--

321
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:46,020
Here Mikey.

322
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:47,310
Your flag.

323
00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:50,610
You're the best, Ken-chin!

324
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:53,080
Where did he get that?

325
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,580
I've had enough!

326
00:17:57,610 --> 00:17:58,650
What is it?

327
00:17:58,680 --> 00:17:59,970
Is it fight this time?

328
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:04,940
He's sleeping?

329
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:08,120
You really should fix your habit
sleeping right after you eat!

330
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:12,240
Sheesh, you're so helpless.

331
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:16,940
So that's how Mikey-kun usually acts...

332
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,110
Draken-kun is amazing.

333
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:28,330
He supports him like that everyday.

334
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:31,860
But if he ever flipped out...

335
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:36,530
Mikey, we're here.

336
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:40,110
What are we here for?

337
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:42,690
A little visit.

338
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:46,340
Who?

339
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:48,800
Pah's friend's girlfriend.

340
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:53,320
The cause of their
dispute with Moebius.

341
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:57,270
They said she have been
unconscious for five days.

342
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:02,310
What the hell you guys are here for?

343
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:05,520
Don't you dare show
your face here! Get lost!

344
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:06,580
Honey...

345
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:10,940
What is that for?

346
00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:14,180
My daughter nearly died
because of you guys!

347
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:16,480
You don't have to lower your head, Kenchin.

348
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,070
We did nothing wrong.

349
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:20,710
Why this old man taking
it out on us anyway?

350
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:22,620
You worthless imbeciles!

351
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:27,260
You guys are garbage to the society with
those annoying noises you make all night!

352
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,030
Please stop it, Honey!

353
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:32,220
You brats caused nothing but
trouble and hurt a lot of people!

354
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:35,800
You think you will be forgiven just
by behaving yourself for one day?!

355
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:37,870
You nasty piece of turd!

356
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:41,050
Who do you think you're talking to--

357
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:43,510
Hey, what are you doing!

358
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:45,890
It's all our fault.

359
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:46,840
Hey!

360
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:50,610
Two scumbags lowering their head
won't make my daughter any better!

361
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:51,400
Huh?!

362
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:53,310
Pipe down, Mikey!

363
00:19:53,970 --> 00:19:55,980
Mikey-kun's right.

364
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:58,120
It's not their fault.

365
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:02,490
My daughter has been in a coma since.

366
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:05,940
Her face...

367
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:08,420
Her body...

368
00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:11,100
It's all full of wound...

369
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:16,700
Why?

370
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:20,280
Just what did she even do to you guys?

371
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:26,730
She's a very kind girl.

372
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:29,030
She's our precious daughter.

373
00:20:29,050 --> 00:20:32,720
But now she has been
completely disfigured.

374
00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:37,010
Please leave.

375
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:40,660
Please never show up
in front of us ever again.

376
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:49,430
We're going to fight Moebius soon.

377
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:54,040
The problem in our world is something
we must deal with ourselves.

378
00:20:54,910 --> 00:20:59,330
All of our members have families
and people they care about.

379
00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:02,680
We must not let outsiders involved.

380
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:05,580
We must not make people
around them cry.

381
00:21:06,930 --> 00:21:09,150
You don't have to force yourself to bow.

382
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,230
Have a heart and care about others.

383
00:21:15,530 --> 00:21:17,480
You're so kind, Ken-chin.

384
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:20,450
Sorry, Ken-chin.

385
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,350
I...

386
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:25,980
...am glad that you're here with me.

387
00:21:28,170 --> 00:21:30,530
I think I understand now.

388
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:34,670
The reason why Mikey
changed after Draken died.

389
00:21:35,450 --> 00:21:39,660
Just why Toman 12 years in the future
ended up becoming a criminal organization.

390
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:43,650
Draken is not a person
who deserves to die.

391
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:47,050
Draken is Mikey's heart.

392
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,630
He fills in what he lacks.

393
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,390
I'm hungry now.

394
00:21:54,390 --> 00:21:57,230
Huh? You just ate.

395
00:21:57,230 --> 00:21:59,170
I get hungry after I sleep.

396
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:01,270
How does that even work?

397
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:03,680
Naoto.

398
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:09,630
There is no way an infight would happen
in Toman because of these two!

399
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:26,630
I just want to be right next to you

400
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:29,890
Next to your slightly sweaty shirt

401
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:35,430
The rain falls all of the sudden

402
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:38,980
So I kissed you on that lonely night

403
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:48,900
If you look back, I will always
be there and smiling at you

404
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,660
Please

405
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:57,160
Give up on that unachievable future

406
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:59,540
Take it now

407
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:01,580
In the real new world

408
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:06,380
If I have to give you a name,
it's "My Hero"

409
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:08,420
That straight wish

410
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:10,760
Will go beyond the stopped time

411
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:15,600
"I don't need anyone but you"

412
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:23,150
I will keep living here

413
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:31,820
Break down that crooked needle

414
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:34,070
Shout out that firm words

415
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:36,790
Kick away that unmeaning destiny
