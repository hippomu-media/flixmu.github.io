1
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:03,970
Look at this picture, it's nuts!

2
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:07,020
Oh crap, it's really nuts!

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:08,090
Like legit nuts!

4
00:00:08,109 --> 00:00:09,670
Seriously nuts!

5
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:10,710
Right?

6
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:12,820
So noisy.

7
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:16,760
Hey!

8
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:20,930
H-Hina?!

9
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:23,040
You're taking too much space.

10
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:25,250
It's fine when there isn't
anyone around.

11
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:27,440
But there's an old lady standing.

12
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:28,930
How about letting her sit?

13
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:31,620
Kay.

14
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:33,000
Scoot over.

15
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:35,460
Thank you.

16
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:37,430
-Cute!
-So cute.

17
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:39,980
Ma'am, there's a free seat over there.

18
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:43,060
Oh, thanks for all the trouble.

19
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:46,190
Hina... she's amazing.

20
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:52,960
We got our collars grabbed
and took an intense punch

21
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:57,840
After we got beaten up
Together we crouched

22
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,260
The anticipated rain came

23
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:08,600
"This should clean your bruise"
you lied with a smile

24
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:16,600
Even though you're bad at argument

25
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:21,820
So stop making such lame jokes

26
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:26,950
It's so bad I teared up

27
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:34,539
Getting blue bruises all the time
I cry, cry, and cry

28
00:01:34,539 --> 00:01:41,210
Leaning our unstable heart together

29
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:45,880
We fight against the rotten Bad End

30
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,640
I wonder why

31
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:55,770
The pleasant pain was more vivid,
even more than the happiness

32
00:01:55,770 --> 00:02:00,400
Clicking our tongue over our wet clothes

33
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:03,780
We look at each other's face and laugh

34
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:15,960
The Revenge we swore in that rainy night

35
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:21,240
Thank you for coming
to shop with me.

36
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:23,110
Yeah, don't mention it.

37
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:24,940
How did your finals go?

38
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:27,980
Oh, finals? That's so nostalgic!

39
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:30,800
Nostalgic?
But we just had them earlier.

40
00:02:30,829 --> 00:02:32,840
Ah, yeah, that's true.

41
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:35,250
Crap, I said it out loud.

42
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,620
You should study properly.

43
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:39,660
You got a dream, don't you?

44
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:41,390
A dream?

45
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:43,790
Did I have a dream before?

46
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:48,320
Okay, I've decided.

47
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,090
I'll help you study.

48
00:02:58,190 --> 00:02:59,190
What's wrong?

49
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,210
This is my first time being
inside a girl's room.

50
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,880
Don't look around that much.

51
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:07,060
Sorry.

52
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,080
You have no tact.

53
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:10,460
I'm sorry.

54
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:13,580
It was sudden so I didn't
have much to prepare.

55
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:17,180
Even though this is the first time
Hina brought a boy over.

56
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:19,290
-Mama!
-Don't worry about it.

57
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:21,220
What a cute boy.

58
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,610
How did you meet him?
Is he from the same class?

59
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,820
That's enough, Mama! Get out!

60
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,990
Eeeh?

61
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:28,880
-Is he your boyfriend?
-Mama!

62
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:32,380
I don't get this at all.

63
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:34,460
Ah, that's right.

64
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:36,270
Thank you for helping
out my brother.

65
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:40,360
He told me you saved
him from delinquents.

66
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:45,600
Our father is usually really busy,
so he rarely comes home.

67
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,490
Naoto said he hates him for that.

68
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:51,680
But now he suddenly says that
he wants to be like him someday.

69
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:56,590
Our dad is a police officer.

70
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,470
So that's why Naoto
became a police officer!

71
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:01,450
Eh?

72
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,830
But he isn't though.
He's still too young.

73
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:07,470
Y-Y-Yeah!
What am I even talking about!

74
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:12,500
But maybe, I'm the one
who was saved that day.

75
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:13,660
Eh?

76
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,550
I'm sure he will become a great
police officer one day.

77
00:04:17,149 --> 00:04:20,570
Well, he might be a bit
crazy in some places.

78
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,400
You sure have changed, Takemichi-kun.

79
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:25,230
D-Do you think so?

80
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:26,890
In what way?

81
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:33,200
It's like you've become kinder,
or act more like an adult.

82
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:36,260
It's like I'm talking to someone
much older than me.

83
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,330
Really~?

84
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:39,570
She's sharp! I am 12 years older now!

85
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:44,320
I guess there are things that
I have yet to know about you.

86
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,390
Eh?

87
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:49,659
I want to know more
about you, Takemichi-kun.

88
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:57,330
Oh! Fireworks!

89
00:04:57,350 --> 00:05:00,570
That's right! There's a
firework festival today!

90
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:07,120
Hey, let's watch them from the rooftop.

91
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:12,790
So pretty!

92
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:16,030
Hurry up, Takemichi-kun!

93
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:21,390
Crap, this is so much fun!

94
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:25,580
I never experienced this
in my previous life.

95
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:29,300
Whoa, it's heart shaped!

96
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:31,010
Hey, did you see that?

97
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:32,930
I want to stay here forever.

98
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,130
I don't want to go back to the future.

99
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:38,560
After all, in the future....

100
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:41,510
Hina... doesn't exist.

101
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:46,500
It should be okay to
hold her hand, right?

102
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:54,690
So warm.

103
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,150
Hina...

104
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,260
Nnn?

105
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:07,080
H-Hey...

106
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:09,030
Naoto?!

107
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:12,190
That handshake is the trigger.

108
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:16,890
Na... Naoto?!

109
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:18,970
Eh? You're here, too, Naoto?

110
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:20,080
Yeah.

111
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:23,490
You got to be kidding me!!!

112
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,090
Takemichi-kun!

113
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:31,010
Now I'm back...!

114
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:33,810
So that means you managed
to return to the past?

115
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,490
So our handshake is the trigger!

116
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:39,909
Just why were you there!

117
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:41,870
Eh? What are you talking about?

118
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:46,300
Anyway, my theory wasn't wrong!

119
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:48,310
Yeah, yeah, you were right.

120
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,360
And you've made it back.

121
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:51,570
Nnn?

122
00:06:51,659 --> 00:06:54,240
I understand now...
about everything.

123
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:55,909
How about you?

124
00:06:55,909 --> 00:06:58,730
You come back because you
made a progress, right?

125
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:01,350
Well...

126
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:04,360
You shook my hand on accident?!

127
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:06,170
Get yourself together!

128
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:10,300
I learned something from
your second time leap.

129
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:11,800
Oh?

130
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:17,820
Your ability to time leap allows you to
go to the same date 12 years in the past.

131
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:21,760
For example, if you were to
return to the past today,

132
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:23,950
you'd arrive at the same date 12 years ago.

133
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:27,060
And if you stay for a week
there and then return,

134
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:30,400
you would arrive in the present
a week after your departure.

135
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:36,440
And during your trip to the past,
your body is in suspended animation.

136
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:38,670
Eh? You mean I was dead?

137
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:42,610
It means your body that remains
in the present is an empty shell.

138
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,570
Oh, so that's why I was
in suspended animation?

139
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:50,470
It's dangerous, so next time you do
a time leap, let's do it in my room.

140
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:55,010
So, how did the mission to prevent
Sano and Kisaki from meeting go?

141
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:58,850
Well, I did meet Mikey-kun.

142
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:01,530
Mikey? Ah, you mean Sano?

143
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:03,250
Hear me out, Naoto!

144
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,540
Mikey is a delinquent,
but he's a good guy.

145
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:06,570
Huh?

146
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:08,640
Why didn't you kill him?

147
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:10,050
Eh? Kill?

148
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:12,100
The person who killed
my sister is a good guy?

149
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,290
Did he trick you into
believing that in the past?

150
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:15,950
-No!
-Listen up!

151
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:19,130
That "Mikey" guy is now a man who has
been involved in every crime imaginable

152
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,250
that even the police can't control!

153
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:25,230
If it's possible,
I'd like to kill him myself.

154
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:35,940
Naoto.

155
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:38,070
Let's go meet Mikey-kun.

156
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,460
It's dangerous!

157
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:42,559
I want to meet him in person
and ask him directly.

158
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:44,920
Whatever you say to him,
it's pointless.

159
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:47,810
Mikey-kun is a trustworthy person.

160
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:52,530
I want to ask Mikey's opinion
on why Toman changed.

161
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:57,320
I want to ascertain that
before I go back to the past.

162
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:01,600
Let's look for Mikey-kun together.

163
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,730
I beg you, Naoto.

164
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:11,280
I don't know what happened in the past.

165
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,730
But you sure have changed, Takemichi-kun.

166
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:15,810
Eh? You think so?

167
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:16,840
In what way?

168
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:19,490
You have become less frail.

169
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,020
Just by a little, though.

170
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:25,100
S-So you're saying I've become cool?

171
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:27,490
Well then, let's look for
a way to meet Mikey now.

172
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:30,150
Hey hey, or you're saying I'm hot now?

173
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:32,870
-Hey hey!
-Don't get so full of yourself.

174
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,280
Takemichi-kun, sort
through those documents.

175
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:40,590
The Tokyo Manji Gang is real nuts.

176
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,700
Mikey is a frighteningly cautious person.

177
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:45,900
Even the police haven't
gotten any leads on him.

178
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:50,130
The phone number he uses is
probably registered under a fake name.

179
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:52,710
Who is this?

180
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:53,560
Mnn?

181
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:59,640
One of the managers of Toman,
Atsushi Sendo!

182
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:00,980
It's Akkun!

183
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:06,310
Akkun? Is he your friend?

184
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:07,420
Yeah.

185
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:09,580
That's weird.

186
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,920
If it's him, when he was 16,

187
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:15,240
he should be arrested for stabbing
Masataka Kiyomizu from Toman,

188
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:18,460
and become a small-time hoodlum
after being released from prison.

189
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:23,030
I actually tried to stab Kiyomasa-kun.

190
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:25,260
He did say that!

191
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,050
Could it be...

192
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:28,880
Because the past was changed?!

193
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:33,910
Since Akkun didn't attack Kiyomasa-kun,
he didn't get arrested by the police.

194
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:36,630
And since you become close with Mikey...

195
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:37,670
So does Sendo?

196
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:40,710
Akkun is a manager in Toman?

197
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:44,310
Oh right!

198
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:46,030
Can you contact Sendo?

199
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:47,920
Eh? Yeah.

200
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:49,720
If he didn't change his phone number.

201
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:54,210
If Sendo Atsushi is a manager there,
then he might be able to contact Mikey.

202
00:10:58,330 --> 00:11:00,530
It's dirty so you should prepare yourself.

203
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,850
Well, I can imagine.

204
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:05,550
So dirty!

205
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:07,810
I did tell you to prepare yourself.

206
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:09,690
How can someone even live here?

207
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:11,860
Just hold on for a minute.

208
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:16,590
I'm gonna look for the memo
book I used a long time ago.

209
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:17,550
Ouch.

210
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:20,970
The house dust is giving me the hives!

211
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:22,370
I'll go buy masks.

212
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:24,750
Yeah yeah, go run for it!

213
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,230
(Secret)
Ah, found it!

214
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:32,760
This is it!

215
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:35,230
Whoa, so nostalgic!

216
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:38,320
All those memories are coming back!

217
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,240
Who was this guy? So nostalgic!

218
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:44,020
Can you please hurry up?

219
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,810
Ah, yeah.

220
00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:47,030
Akkun, right?

221
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:48,580
I got it, okay.

222
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,520
Found him.

223
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:53,490
Let's hope he didn't change his number.

224
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:01,420
Akkun...

225
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,600
See you guys tomorrow.

226
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,350
See ya!

227
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:11,710
Man, my body hurts all over the places.

228
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,200
Hey, Akkun.

229
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:21,860
If we all go to our separate ways
after graduating and stop meeting up...

230
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:26,020
What do you think we'll talk
about after becoming adults?

231
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:28,740
Nothing will change, dumbass.

232
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:29,990
Eh?

233
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:31,560
We will always be friends.

234
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:41,920
You think Sendo is here?

235
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:43,300
Yeah.

236
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:46,200
He told me this is the hostess
club he runs right now.

237
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:49,250
Is it really safe to just show up
here nonchalantly?

238
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:52,200
Sendo is one of the manager
in Toman right now.

239
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:56,470
Touman's manager or not,
Akkun is still Akkun.

240
00:12:57,170 --> 00:13:00,610
He does sound a bit
older on the phone,

241
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:02,270
but he's still the same as always.

242
00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:07,000
I'm concerned that you told him
that we're looking for Mikey.

243
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,280
Why?

244
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:10,120
You're being too frank.

245
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:12,490
Not even the police can
get close to this guy.

246
00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:15,250
We might get killed inside.

247
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:17,440
Naoto, you're such a dummy!

248
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:20,580
Real friendship won't change that easily.

249
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:23,090
Just shut up and follow me!

250
00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:30,190
Welcome! Who would you like to pick?

251
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,490
Eh? Ah, ermm...

252
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:33,940
Are you okay?

253
00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:37,130
W-We're here to meet
up with Sendo-san.

254
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:40,320
Huh? You? With our president?

255
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,880
Hey! Some shabby-looking guy is here!

256
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:46,410
Did the president have appointment today?

257
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:50,370
Oh jeez! You should've just
say so earlier, Hanagaki-san!

258
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:53,880
If we know you were president's friend,
we would let you go see him immediately!

259
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:56,290
Two VIPs coming in!

260
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:58,790
He's making fun of he, isn't he?

261
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:00,350
Nah, no way.

262
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:07,160
Your hand is trembling, Takemichi-kun.

263
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,200
It's not because I'm scared!

264
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:11,220
It's okay!

265
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:13,580
No matter how much his
social status changed...

266
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,710
No matter how distinguished
he has become...

267
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,920
Akkun is still Akkun!

268
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:20,780
Takemichi.

269
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,720
Behind you.

270
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:29,490
You haven't changed at all, Takemichi.

271
00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:32,280
(Tokyo Manji Gang Manager - Atsushi Sendo)
You haven't changed at all, Takemichi.

272
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:34,080
Akkun!

273
00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:38,000
Didn't recognize me without
my pompadour, huh?

274
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,640
Yeah.

275
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:42,670
I thought about calling you earlier.

276
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:45,370
But it was so nostalgic seeing
you so I didn't.

277
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:47,590
It's Akkun!

278
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:50,840
He looks completely different,
but he's still Akkun!

279
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:54,060
So you want to meet Mikey-san?

280
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:58,370
I've been waiting for you, too.

281
00:14:58,750 --> 00:14:59,780
Takemichi.

282
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,820
What do you mean?

283
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,130
Let's talk about this outside.

284
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:10,200
Just the two of us.

285
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,200
Is it okay?

286
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:15,030
I will be waiting here.

287
00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:17,790
Be careful.

288
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:19,190
It's fine.

289
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,740
There's no need to worry.

290
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:32,300
Have you been doing well, Takemichi?

291
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:35,190
T-T-T-That hurts, Akkun!

292
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:38,420
I'm just so happy to meet
you after so long!

293
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:40,310
A lot of time has gone by!

294
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:43,900
You remember that time with Yamagishi?

295
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:45,830
When he farted and
ruined the whole thing?

296
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:46,920
Yes!

297
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:49,110
Man, even though I was
so in the zone then!

298
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:52,450
You were really lame that time.

299
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:55,280
It's been since middle school, huh?

300
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,390
Yeah.

301
00:15:56,930 --> 00:15:59,760
I suppose it has been 10 years
from your perspective.

302
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:04,540
But man, you're amazing, Akkun.

303
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:06,500
You're the owner of a huge hostess club.

304
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,630
And you're a manager in Toman, right?

305
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:10,310
Yeah...

306
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:13,180
You get to drive the best car,
wear the best clothes,

307
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,740
and sleep with the best woman.

308
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:17,170
You're living in a completely
different world from me.

309
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:20,640
There's a limit in how much stuff
you can get with money.

310
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:23,750
Man, I really want to be able to say that.

311
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:27,320
The guy you're with is
a police officer, right?

312
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,360
Eh?

313
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:29,790
Well...

314
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:32,230
You don't have to hide it. It's obvious.

315
00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:35,910
He's Hinata Tachibana's
little brother, isn't he?

316
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:39,440
I didn't know she had a little brother.

317
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:42,940
Why do you know about that?

318
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:48,530
The Tokyo Manji Gang is that
type of organization.

319
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:52,880
Hey, do you remember?

320
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,510
Summer, our second middle school year.

321
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:57,140
That day you rebelled
against Kiyomasa-kun.

322
00:16:57,530 --> 00:17:01,040
After everyone else had
gone home, you told me...

323
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:08,950
"What'd you think we will talk
about after becoming adults?"

324
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,890
Yeah! I remember that!

325
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,170
So how about this...

326
00:17:16,569 --> 00:17:19,040
The one who pushed you
onto those train tracks...

327
00:17:20,369 --> 00:17:21,450
...was me.

328
00:17:27,819 --> 00:17:28,820
Eh?

329
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,710
You should've died back then.

330
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:34,430
But someone saved you.

331
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:37,290
It's Naoto Tachibana!

332
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:42,770
To me, it looks like he knew for sure
that you will fall onto the train tracks.

333
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,140
This might sounds crazy, but...

334
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:49,810
Are you perhaps...
able to return to the past?

335
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:54,340
And then you asked Tachibana Naoto
in the past to save you.

336
00:17:54,610 --> 00:17:55,890
Isn't that right?

337
00:17:55,910 --> 00:17:57,520
It would be weird if it isn't!

338
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:00,990
He shouldn't be able to save you there
if he hadn't known beforehand!

339
00:18:01,370 --> 00:18:03,570
Right?! It's weird right?!

340
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:04,840
Stop it!

341
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:06,870
Who's the weird one here?!

342
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:08,760
What are you saying, Akkun?!

343
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,870
You're not like this!

344
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:13,680
You were always composed.

345
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:18,650
You can sacrifice yourself
for your friend's sake.

346
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:20,790
You were kind.

347
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:22,720
Dependable.

348
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:24,870
That's why...

349
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,470
That's why...

350
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:28,690
You have to be lying!

351
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:32,110
There's no way Akkun would kill me!

352
00:18:32,530 --> 00:18:35,330
Akkun is my friend!

353
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:44,220
Takemichi.

354
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:49,670
Just how did I end up like this?

355
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:54,180
I'm now of one of Kisaki's men.

356
00:18:54,410 --> 00:18:55,730
Kisaki?

357
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,210
You mean Tetta Kisaki?

358
00:18:57,260 --> 00:19:00,370
Everyone in Toman is controlled by Kisaki.

359
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:03,470
I haven't even seen Mikey-kun in years.

360
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:06,350
Akkun...

361
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:09,020
It's not too late!

362
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:10,770
You should just quit Toman!

363
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,440
No... that's impossible.

364
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,530
I'm scared.

365
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:19,120
I'm simply too scared of Kisaki.

366
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:21,920
Akkun...

367
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:27,900
Takemichi.

368
00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:32,780
Mikey changed after Draken died.

369
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:34,130
Eh?

370
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:35,960
Draken is dead?!

371
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:39,160
He's not the type of person
who deserves to die.

372
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,580
Draken who shouldn't die, died.

373
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,550
And I'm here playing around
with filthy money.

374
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:49,670
I always admired you.

375
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:52,060
You always stand firm even while crying.

376
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,220
Akkun?

377
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:58,750
The person you want to save
by returning to the past...

378
00:19:59,090 --> 00:20:00,090
It's "her," right?

379
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,870
It's dangerous.

380
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,510
Get down from there.

381
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,850
It sure is the "ultimate love," isn't it?

382
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:10,080
Good luck, Takemichi.

383
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,680
Please save everyone.

384
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:16,880
Akkun!

385
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:18,970
Our crybaby hero.

386
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,760
Stop it Akkun!

387
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:22,330
Akkun!

388
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:22,220
I'm sorry but please leave
him alone for now.

389
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:24,350
It's fine.

390
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:26,460
They want to ask me stuff, right?

391
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,080
Please don't force yourself.

392
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:36,590
Let's take a rest for a while.

393
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:38,380
Naoto.

394
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:42,690
Please investigate
Ken Ryuguji's death for me.

395
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:48,610
The man who turned Toman into
a crime organization is Tetta Kisaki.

396
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:51,400
Naoto...

397
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:52,850
I want to...

398
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:57,230
Draken... Akkun...

399
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:00,550
and Hina...

400
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:07,550
I want to save all of them!

401
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:26,630
I just want to be right next to you

402
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:29,890
Next to your slightly sweaty shirt

403
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:35,430
The rain falls all of the sudden

404
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:38,980
So I kissed you in that lonely night

405
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:48,900
If you look back, I will always
be there and smiling at you

406
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,660
Please

407
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:57,160
Give up on that unachievable future

408
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:59,540
Take it now

409
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:01,580
In the real new world

410
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:06,380
If I have to give you a name,
it's "My Hero"

411
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:08,420
That straight wish

412
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:10,760
Will go beyond the stopped time

413
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:15,600
"I don't need anyone but you"

414
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:23,150
I will keep living here

415
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:31,820
Break down that crooked needle

416
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:34,070
Shout out that firm words

417
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:36,790
Kick away that unmeaning destiny
