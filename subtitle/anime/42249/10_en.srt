1
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:10,970
-It's just around that corner!
-Okay!

2
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,030
It's Moebius.

3
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:25,060
Draken-kun!

4
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:27,070
Hey, Mitsuya.

5
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:28,850
Takemicchi.

6
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:32,500
Takemicchi! Mitsuya!

7
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:33,680
Emma-chan!

8
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:36,410
Peh-yan, you bastard!

9
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:38,840
Why are you teaming up with Moebius?!

10
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:41,990
Shut up, Mitsuya! We will kill you too!

11
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:45,080
You guys really think you can win
with just the two of you?

12
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:49,060
Mikey...

13
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,180
Mikey-kun!

14
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:54,970
Who made you do this?

15
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:00,220
It doesn't matter who I am.

16
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:03,930
But I'm in charge of Moebius.
For this moment, at least.

17
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:05,200
I'm Hanma.

18
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:08,810
Moebius's entire gang, 100 people!

19
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:11,210
Versus four guys from Toman!

20
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:24,640
Good grief.

21
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:26,460
You guys...

22
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:31,560
The entire Tokyo Manji
Gang's now here, jackass!

23
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:36,390
This is getting fun.

24
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:39,870
Let's go!

25
00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:42,509
Kill 'em all!

26
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:52,150
This is bad! It started!

27
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:54,580
I must protect Draken-kun no matter what!

28
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:56,640
Draken-kun!

29
00:01:57,050 --> 00:02:00,510
I... don't want to fight you.

30
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:03,450
Come back to us, Peh-yan.

31
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:13,500
There he is.

32
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:17,510
I found him! It's Kiyomasa-kun!

33
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:21,460
I did it! I finally did it!

34
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:33,470
Draken...

35
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:34,960
Draken!

36
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:36,320
Draken-kun!

37
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,829
Draken-kun!

38
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:39,850
Draken-kun!

39
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,840
Draken-kun!

40
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:55,310
Draken-kun!

41
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:00,870
No way! It can't be true!

42
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:08,560
What happened, Takemicchi?!

43
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:10,510
Draken-kun...

44
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:12,730
Draken-kun...

45
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:15,530
...he got stabbed!

46
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:24,340
Move out!

47
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:28,140
Get out of my way!

48
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,270
Hanma!

49
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:40,350
Mikey.

50
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:42,110
Found cha'!

51
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:17,470
How dull~

52
00:04:19,209 --> 00:04:24,050
We got our collars grabbed
and took an intense punch

53
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:28,960
After we got beaten up
Together we crouched

54
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,380
The anticipated rain came

55
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:39,720
"This should clean your bruise"
you lied with a smile

56
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:47,720
Even though you're bad at argument

57
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:52,940
So stop making such lame jokes

58
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:58,070
It's so bad I teared up

59
00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:05,660
Getting blue bruises all the time
I cry, cry, and cry

60
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:12,330
Leaning our unstable heart together

61
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:17,000
We fight against the rotten Bad End

62
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,760
I wonder why

63
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:26,890
The pleasant pain was more vivid,
even more than the happiness

64
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:31,520
Clicking our tongue over our wet clothes

65
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:34,900
We look at each other's face and laugh

66
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:47,080
The Revenge we swore in that rainy night

67
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,710
It's over!

68
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:57,940
Everything is over!

69
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:01,810
Draken... died!

70
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,400
Takemicchi!

71
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:09,660
He's still alive!

72
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:10,940
Mikey-kun!

73
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:14,290
Take care of Ken-chin!

74
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:19,790
Eh?

75
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,860
Me?

76
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:43,370
That's right.

77
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:46,990
I...

78
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:52,340
I...

79
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:55,920
...must do something!

80
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,650
He's heavy.

81
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:19,840
I feel like my body is giving up already.

82
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,070
Draken-kun!

83
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,920
It'll be fine.

84
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:33,330
I will carry you to the hospital.

85
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:38,790
I promise you...

86
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:43,260
Everything is gonna be alright!

87
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:47,560
Keep it together, my body!

88
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:51,780
Takemichi-kun!

89
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,530
Hina! Emma-chan!

90
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:55,940
I will call the ambulance now.

91
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,409
How's Draken?

92
00:07:57,530 --> 00:07:59,970
Don't worry. He's still alive.

93
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:11,080
It's taking too much time.

94
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:15,310
Hina, we're supposed to wait
for the ambulance here, right?

95
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:17,340
Yeah, but...

96
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,540
It seems like the road's packed
because of the festival and the rain.

97
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,720
Seriously?

98
00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:32,799
Takemichi-kun?

99
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:37,289
Why... are they here?

100
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:43,150
Oooh? The little sweet
Draken ain't dead yet!

101
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:46,750
Hey! Why Wimpy-michi is here?

102
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:52,080
How dare a little shit like you
giving me trouble here?

103
00:08:56,950 --> 00:09:00,550
Hey, someone go get
some duct tape again.

104
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,900
It's over.

105
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:15,440
Takemicchi.

106
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:23,790
Draken-kun...

107
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:25,770
You shouldn't move.

108
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:32,510
Thank you.

109
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:34,470
Takemicchi.

110
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:41,400
Take Hina-chan and Emma
with you and run.

111
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:46,950
I... am fine.

112
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:50,100
Run?

113
00:09:55,850 --> 00:09:59,570
Did I... try to run just now?

114
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:02,440
And he noticed that?

115
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:05,880
Hurry up, Takemicchi.

116
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:08,490
Even though he was beaten up this bad?

117
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:13,620
And I...

118
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:17,790
...already lost everything
because I kept running away.

119
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:23,580
Am I going to run away for the second time?

120
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:31,410
Takemichi-kun?

121
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,590
I'm so pathetic.

122
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:37,300
Just why did I come here
in the first place?

123
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,640
Hina, stay back.

124
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:46,590
Draken-kun.

125
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:47,940
I'm sorry.

126
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:50,210
Thank you for giving me courage.

127
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:52,460
Takemicchi?

128
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:56,550
If I run now, everything will be over.

129
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:59,770
It's not just for other people's sake.

130
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,560
What do you want?

131
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:11,440
Do you want to die, shithead?

132
00:11:11,890 --> 00:11:14,960
You sure you don't wanna
run away, Moron-michi?!

133
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:19,630
I won't run away.

134
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:24,060
This time, I won't run anymore.

135
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:28,400
For everything
that happened in my life...

136
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:32,020
...This is my revenge!

137
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:44,880
Kiyomasa-kun.

138
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:48,010
We haven't settled it, have we?

139
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:49,520
Huh?

140
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:52,770
That one-on-one back
at the underground fight.

141
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,290
Huh?

142
00:11:54,290 --> 00:11:56,760
What the heck are you talking about?

143
00:11:56,780 --> 00:12:00,060
No matter how you look at it,
it's your darn lost!

144
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:01,440
I didn't lose.

145
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,470
Ooh.

146
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:09,190
Then I bet 100 million yen on Takemicchi.

147
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,720
-Eh?
-Huh?

148
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:14,430
It's bullshit, but I'll play along.

149
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:17,570
I bet 100 million yen on Takemichi, too!

150
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:19,210
I bet 300 million yen!

151
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:21,140
Hina? Emma-chan?!

152
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:27,080
These guys just lost their
damn minds, didn't they?

153
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:29,540
We didn't.

154
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:32,730
Huh?

155
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:36,040
Takemicchi will win.

156
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:40,830
Huh?

157
00:12:42,650 --> 00:12:44,190
Thank you, everyone.

158
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:47,180
Let's go, Kiyomasa!

159
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:49,680
Let's fight!

160
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:03,730
Really? I thought that'd do the trick.

161
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,810
You surprisngly got a nice reflex, huh?

162
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,300
Takemichi-kun!

163
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:09,720
Hina, it's dangerous! Stay back!

164
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:12,290
Let go! Takemichi-kun is in danger!

165
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:19,390
I have no interest in doing one-on-one.

166
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:23,210
This is an execution!

167
00:13:24,090 --> 00:13:26,040
Kiyomasa you rad!

168
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:31,760
I will kill you, Hanagaki.

169
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:50,750
We'll dominate the whole country!

170
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,050
Huh?

171
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,520
What is it, all of the sudden?

172
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,610
If you wanna live as a delinquent,
then the question is

173
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:01,920
how far you can climb up
with just your fist!

174
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:05,720
I thought I could become
the number one delinquent in Tokyo.

175
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:10,180
The first step is Shibuya Third Mid.

176
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:14,390
But that dream was quickly crushed.

177
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:19,150
I couldn't become Mikey-kun.

178
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,820
What's wrong, Hanagaki?

179
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:27,550
You haven't landed a single
punch on me yet.

180
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:32,630
"My awful life was all this guy's fault."

181
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:35,210
I'll beat you to death.

182
00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:37,080
"I was unlucky."

183
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:39,340
That's what I thought.

184
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,190
But I was wrong.

185
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,890
All of that...

186
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:50,500
It's all my fault!

187
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:55,200
I didn't fight back
just because I lost once.

188
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,790
It's all because of my weakness!

189
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:03,860
Takemichi-kun!

190
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:07,500
Hanagaki, your girl gonna
get disillusioned hard.

191
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:10,110
She'll learn you're as weak as flies.

192
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:14,180
Is clinging to him all you can do?
That's just lame!

193
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,630
That hurt!

194
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:20,290
He bit him!

195
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,750
That's just pathetic, wimp-michi!

196
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:24,370
What are you, an elementary schooler?

197
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:26,980
Let go of me, you bastard!

198
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:29,420
It doesn't matter if I'm lame.

199
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:31,730
It doesn't matter if I'm pathetic.

200
00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:45,020
It doesn't matter if I can't
become Mikey-kun!

201
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,940
I am...

202
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:50,420
TAKEMICHI HANAGAKI!!!

203
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:56,560
You are you.

204
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:04,990
This is my second life.

205
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:09,060
I won't give up on it this time!

206
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:12,380
Let me go!

207
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:17,840
Don't let go of him, Takemicchi!

208
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:22,810
You shit!

209
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:52,620
I won.

210
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:01,480
My revenge...

211
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:04,960
...Succeeds!

212
00:17:07,339 --> 00:17:09,569
-Takemichi-kun!
-Don't come, Hina!

213
00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:21,130
I showed my guts, Naoto.

214
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:25,619
I... beat Kiyomasa.

215
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:30,940
But, sorry... Naoto.

216
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,990
The mission failed.

217
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:37,890
Don't mind it.

218
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,570
Kiyomasa's so lame.

219
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:42,630
Now you got a nice story
to tell in the afterlife.

220
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:48,730
Hina.

221
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,220
Run with Emma-chan.

222
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:53,240
Takemichi-kun...

223
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:58,100
We'll handle this ourselves somehow.

224
00:17:58,950 --> 00:17:59,990
But...

225
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:02,830
It'll be okay.

226
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:07,530
We will surely be okay.

227
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:10,010
I beg you.

228
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:25,700
Draken-kun.

229
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:30,250
What do you think heaven is like?

230
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:44,080
You'll go straight down to hell.

231
00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:48,360
But I didn't do anything bad.

232
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:53,070
Oh, look, they're getting all fired up.

233
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:54,850
They pissed me off.

234
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:59,470
I can't feel my left hand anymore.

235
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:02,060
And I can't even lift my right hand.

236
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:15,150
You look like someone could topple
you with just one finger, Takemicchi.

237
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:18,510
Same goes for you.

238
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,010
End them!

239
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:28,510
In the end, I couldn't change the future.

240
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,550
But I did my best.

241
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,920
I won't look down until the very end!

242
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:53,040
Why are you sobbing like that?

243
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:57,230
Crybaby hero!

244
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:01,750
Akkun!

245
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:05,490
Everyone!

246
00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:07,790
Mizo Mid Five has arrived!

247
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,130
Tachibana called us.

248
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:17,670
Leave this to us!

249
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:20,700
We can kick some ass
when we put our minds to it!

250
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:22,320
Float like a crane!

251
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:24,560
Sting like a horsefly!

252
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:33,660
You dumbass!

253
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:36,310
You guys are just
some pussies in a group.

254
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,320
What can you even do?

255
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:47,510
Draken-kun.

256
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:49,380
I'm sorry.

257
00:20:51,810 --> 00:20:56,130
I couldn't protect you just by myself.

258
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:01,920
Since my first time coming to this place,

259
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:04,110
I haven't been able to do anything right.

260
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:06,720
But!

261
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,260
Your effort here is useless.

262
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:15,180
Useless?

263
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:20,130
Even if it's really useless...

264
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:24,400
Fight me one-on-one.

265
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:27,390
Even so!

266
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:29,610
I ain't giving up!

267
00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:32,910
There is time where
giving up is not an option!

268
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:36,980
Isn't that right, Takemichi?

269
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:48,760
I definitely won't lose!

270
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:01,820
Everyone...

271
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:03,570
Thank you.

272
00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:06,570
It's our...

273
00:22:07,950 --> 00:22:09,280
...victory!

274
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:26,630
I just want to be right next to you

275
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:29,890
Next to your slightly sweaty shirt

276
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:35,430
The rain falls all of the sudden

277
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:38,980
So I kissed you on that lonely night

278
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:48,900
If you look back, I will always
be there and smiling at you

279
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,660
Please

280
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:57,160
Give up on that unachievable future

281
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:59,540
Take it now

282
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:01,580
In the real new world

283
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:06,380
If I have to give you a name,
it's "My Hero"

284
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:08,420
That straight wish

285
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:10,760
Will go beyond the stopped time

286
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:15,600
"I don't need anyone but you"

287
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:23,150
I will keep living here

288
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:31,860
Break down that crooked needle

289
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:34,120
Shout out that firm words

290
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:36,790
Kick away that unmeaning destiny
