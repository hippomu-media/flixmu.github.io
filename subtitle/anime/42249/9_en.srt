1
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:06,800
Draken-kun!

2
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:13,360
Are you prepared?

3
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:14,750
Yeah.

4
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:22,530
I lost everything because of him.

5
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:24,480
Kiyomasa-kun!

6
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:28,580
I will kill Draken.

7
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:30,940
Look what I found!

8
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:32,710
Ouch! Let go of me!

9
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:37,010
Once this is over, I will
blame everything on you.

10
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:41,500
Takemichi-kun!

11
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:50,750
Sorry for leaving you alone like that.

12
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:51,870
Eh?

13
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:55,850
I'm so pathetic.

14
00:00:56,650 --> 00:00:58,100
Takemichi-kun...

15
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,770
I can't change a damn thing!

16
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,450
I can't save anyone!

17
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:08,060
Of course I can't.

18
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:13,900
Just how can someone as worthless
as me save anyone?

19
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:16,380
How stupid am I?

20
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,570
That's not true.

21
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:20,090
Leave me alone!

22
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,150
I'm just a garbage human.

23
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:37,990
It's my first kiss.

24
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:39,970
Why?

25
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,850
I give it to you because
you're special to me.

26
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:47,740
You're not Draken-kun nor Mikey-kun.

27
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:50,810
You are you.

28
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:53,860
You would shed tears for others,

29
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:56,789
and you would worry about
others from the bottom of your heart.

30
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:58,740
You're Takemichi-kun.

31
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:02,400
There is no other guy as cool as you.

32
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:16,470
Hina, thank you.

33
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:18,700
I didn't do a thing.

34
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,030
I...

35
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,450
It'll be okay!

36
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:24,760
I'm sure you will succeed.

37
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:31,030
I must go now.

38
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,760
This time for sure
I will stop Kiyomasa-kun!

39
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:40,100
And I will put an end to this life trauma
I've been running away from!

40
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:45,000
This is bad, Mitsuya-kun!
Draken-kun gonna get attacked!

41
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:46,880
Yeah, I know.

42
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,570
-By Kiyomasa-kun!
-By Peh-yan, right?

43
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,150
-Huh?
-Eh?

44
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:54,360
Wouldn't they already go home
because of the rain?

45
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:56,250
Draken!

46
00:02:57,730 --> 00:02:59,760
Oh, Peh, what's up?

47
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,480
What's with the sash?

48
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:10,900
Peh-yan believes that Toman
abandoned Pah-chin.

49
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:13,250
But that's not true.

50
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:16,950
That dumbass Peh teamed up with
the remnants of Moebius

51
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:19,020
and said he will give Draken a lesson.

52
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:21,050
That means...

53
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:23,990
It's Draken hunt.

54
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:28,190
Why are you looking
so serious, Peh-yan?

55
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:33,320
Emma.

56
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:35,490
Take this and stay back.

57
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:40,810
Peh.

58
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:43,670
Still don't agree how it went down, huh?

59
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:46,460
You can't stand me, can you?

60
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:48,220
You wanna fight?

61
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:50,920
I'll take it on.

62
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,610
Draken!

63
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:20,040
We got our collars grabbed
and took an intense punch

64
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:24,950
After we got beaten up
Together we crouched

65
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:27,370
The anticipated rain came

66
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:35,710
"This should clean your bruise"
you lied with a smile

67
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:43,710
Even though you're bad at argument

68
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:48,930
So stop making such lame jokes

69
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:54,060
It's so bad I teared up

70
00:04:54,060 --> 00:05:01,650
Getting blue bruises all the time
I cry, cry, and cry

71
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:08,320
Leaning our unstable heart together

72
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:12,990
We fight against the rotten Bad End

73
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:14,750
I wonder why

74
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:22,880
The pleasant pain was more vivid,
even more than the happiness

75
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:27,510
Clicking our tongue over our wet clothes

76
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:30,890
We look at each other's face and laugh

77
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:43,070
The Revenge we swore in that rainy night

78
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:48,840
We must tell Draken-kun!

79
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:53,810
Since Peh-yan's bike was there,
the fight may have already started.

80
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,690
On August 3rd, 2005,

81
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:02,020
in a parking lot in Musashi shrine,
at Tokyo's Shibuya-ku,

82
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:04,660
50 people from a Bosozoku had a brawl.

83
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:06,880
A 15 years old middle
school student passed away

84
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:10,750
after being stabbed in
the abdomen with a knife.

85
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:14,580
That middle school student is Ryuguji.

86
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,620
Mitsuya-kun!

87
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,310
It's the parking lot.

88
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:22,440
Is there any parking lot other
than the one we were in?

89
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:25,660
I think there's one on the back.

90
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:26,880
That's it!

91
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:28,550
Hey!

92
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:30,140
Please make it in time!

93
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,100
Takemichi-kun?

94
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:49,060
-It's just around that corner!
-Okay!

95
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:53,830
It's Moebius!

96
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:05,780
Draken-kun!

97
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,990
Hey, Mitsuya.

98
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,690
Takemicchi.

99
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:13,120
Takemichi! Mitsuya!

100
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:14,320
Emma-chan!

101
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:17,020
Peh-yan, you bastard!

102
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:19,600
Why are you working with Moebius?!

103
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:22,800
Shut up, Mitsuya! We will kill you too!

104
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,570
It's the 2nd Squad Captain Mitsuya.

105
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:28,740
He's strong.

106
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:31,570
Peh-yan, this is unfair!

107
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:35,620
You guys attacked him from behind
with a bat and gang out on him!

108
00:07:35,909 --> 00:07:37,640
And you call yourself a man?!

109
00:07:40,659 --> 00:07:42,230
I'm tired.

110
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:44,540
Draken-kun, are you okay?!

111
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:49,800
Seems like... this is my limit.

112
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:52,610
I'm leaving the rest to you.

113
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:54,409
Mitsuya.

114
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,600
Got it.

115
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:58,860
My head hurts.

116
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:02,410
You guys really think you can
win with just the two of you?

117
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,390
Shut up, dimwit.

118
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,250
Kiyomasa-kun is not here.

119
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,690
This is bad.

120
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:12,710
I don't even know where
he's going to attack from.

121
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:16,070
With all these people surrounding us,
how am I supposed to protect him?

122
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:17,880
What should I do?

123
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:20,460
Take all three of them out.

124
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,790
YEAH!

125
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:23,200
Let's do it!

126
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:52,250
Right about time.

127
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:54,220
This exhaust sound...

128
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:56,410
It's Mikey's Bobber.

129
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:08,320
-Hey, isn't that...
-Are you kidding me?

130
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:09,930
No one told me about this.

131
00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:12,400
Mikey...

132
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:14,630
Mikey-kun!

133
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:20,720
Thank goodness!

134
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,660
Now we can stop Peh-yan!

135
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,160
I see.

136
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:33,030
You called me out elsewhere
so you guys can attack Ken-chin.

137
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:34,130
Eh?

138
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:35,950
Someone planned this out?

139
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:41,240
So you're planning to blame this
on me and split Toman in half?

140
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,670
I just want to save Pah-chin--

141
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:44,710
This is not how you do things.

142
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:48,420
Who told you to do this?

143
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:56,420
Does that mean there's someone
behind Peh-yan pulling the strings?

144
00:09:57,510 --> 00:10:01,150
All of that was part of that man's scheme.

145
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:05,860
According to him, someone was
plotting to start an infight in Toman.

146
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:07,500
And Osanai was being used for that.

147
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:11,310
Does that mean Kiyomasa-kun
is also being used by someone?

148
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:14,440
Oh, that's unexpected.

149
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:18,660
Didn't know you're that
sharp in the head.

150
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:24,540
Who are you?

151
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:28,490
Who is this guy?

152
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,530
How dull.

153
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:41,300
It doesn't matter who I am.

154
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:45,490
But I'm in charge of Moebius.
For this moment, at least.

155
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,350
I'm Hanma.

156
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:48,690
(Moebius "Temp" President - Shuji Hanma)

157
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:52,280
So you're the squirming creep
behind all this?

158
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,540
You're a pain in the ass, Mikey-cha--

159
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,030
(Sin)

160
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:07,950
That hurt.

161
00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:11,020
He blocked Mikey's kick?!

162
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:14,420
There's no need to rush, Mikey.

163
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:17,920
My goal is to crush Toman.

164
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:21,430
But it's a pain, so I was trying to
make you fight amongst yourselves.

165
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:24,600
But well, it all worked out in the end.

166
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:28,020
Because now I can take on
the "invincible Mikey"...

167
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:31,520
...and kill you with my own hand!

168
00:11:32,770 --> 00:11:35,060
Is this guy the one behind everything?

169
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:38,870
Moebius's entire gang, 100 people!

170
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:41,360
Versus four guys from Toman!

171
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:44,410
Don't wuss out like you
did last time, you fools!

172
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:48,120
I'm not that soft like Osanai was.

173
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:49,430
Yes, sir!

174
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:54,870
If you run away, I'll hunt you down
and beat you 'till all your teeth are gone!

175
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,600
Yes, sir!

176
00:11:56,630 --> 00:12:00,510
Take on Mikey, Draken,
and every one of them...

177
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:02,930
...and kill 'em all!

178
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:07,220
What's this?

179
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:10,770
Naoto didn't tell me anything about this.

180
00:12:10,770 --> 00:12:15,520
I stopped the infight,
but a different fight just started.

181
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:18,710
Could this be my fault?

182
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:21,600
Did I changed the history
into a weird direction?

183
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:26,040
This is way beyond just
about stopping Kiyomasa-kun.

184
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:28,230
What should I do?

185
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:38,230
-They made it.
-Eh?

186
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,580
Sheesh.

187
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:20,090
Look how big you made this into.

188
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:22,670
(Tokyo Manji Gang 5th Squad Captain -
Yasuhiro Muto)

189
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:25,720
Infighting's not really my thing.

190
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:26,840
(Tokyo Manji Gang 4th Squad Captain -
Nahoya Kawata)

191
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:30,890
But if it's against Moebius,
we can go all-out!

192
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:32,180
(Tokyo Manji Gang 1st Squad Captain -
Keisuke Baji)

193
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:35,990
Which means tonight's the big showdown.

194
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:38,030
You guys...

195
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:43,740
The entire Tokyo Manji
Gang's now here, jackass!

196
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:46,430
Which one of you wants to die first?

197
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:49,060
Peh! I'll kill you first!

198
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:54,300
This is getting fun!

199
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:04,470
This is bad!

200
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:07,100
I can't even tell how many
people are here now!

201
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:10,340
A big brawl on the day of the festival...

202
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:12,820
It makes your blood pumpin'.

203
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,380
Isn't that right, Mikey?

204
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:20,450
You're right, Ken-chin.

205
00:14:22,530 --> 00:14:24,150
Draken-kun!

206
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:25,260
This is bad.

207
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:30,540
Let's go!

208
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,920
Kill 'em all!

209
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,630
This is bad! It started!

210
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:08,260
I must protect Draken-kun no matter what!

211
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:10,230
Draken-kun!

212
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:23,200
You bastard!

213
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:26,170
Down you go! Die you go!

214
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:29,020
Up we go!

215
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:36,720
Who's next?

216
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:53,940
Draken-kun!

217
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:55,480
Draken-kun!

218
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,550
Why are you just standing there?!

219
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:00,710
I'm sorry!

220
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:21,030
Dammit!

221
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:23,850
It's useless after all!

222
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:31,070
I'm sure Draken-kun will get killed
by Kiyomasa-kun in this fight.

223
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:33,610
I...

224
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:36,650
...must protect Draken-kun in this past.

225
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:39,710
I don't want to see that ever again.

226
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:43,250
Akkun's death... Hina's death...!

227
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:55,600
I will stop Kiyomasa-kun.

228
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:57,650
And I...

229
00:16:58,710 --> 00:17:00,630
...will change the future!

230
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:08,599
Don't you get carried away!

231
00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:23,980
Got 'cha!

232
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:44,320
You bastard!

233
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:46,640
You shit!

234
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:52,610
C'mon, what's wrong?!

235
00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:54,140
Is that all?!

236
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:58,850
PEH---!!!

237
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:03,920
Mikey...

238
00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:06,710
It's their boss.

239
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:08,350
Let's get him!

240
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:11,810
The invincible Mikey is just shit!

241
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:16,800
Peh!

242
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,660
Why you attacked Ken-chin?!

243
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,420
You bastard!

244
00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:25,600
You knew that Ken-chin
and I made up already, right?

245
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:33,320
Don't use Moebius to fight dirtily with us!

246
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:38,150
You guys can't just come to
an understanding that easily!

247
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:40,260
I won't accept it!

248
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,440
We're done arguing over Pah.

249
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:44,120
It's not done yet!

250
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:56,890
Pah-chin got arrested, and you just
gonna sit still and do nothing?

251
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:59,060
Don't make me laugh!

252
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:02,550
This is the only thing left I can do!

253
00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:06,310
Pah-chin was everything to me!

254
00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:11,520
If Toman gonna abandon Pah-chin...

255
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:14,150
...then they're my enemy!

256
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:16,700
Come at me, Mikey!

257
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:20,490
Why won't you punch me back?!

258
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:22,370
You can just beat me in one punch!

259
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:29,360
Look at me.

260
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:35,050
Am I laughing?

261
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:40,330
How can I laugh over Pah-chin's arrest?

262
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:43,120
It hurts.

263
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:50,240
It is sad that me and Ken-chin fought
and Toman got split in two.

264
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:52,290
That's what Takemicchi told me.

265
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:56,810
He told me that everyone would
end up fighting because of that.

266
00:19:57,490 --> 00:19:59,750
And I never even thought about it.

267
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:05,160
Punch me as much as you like, Peh-yan.

268
00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:07,810
Mikey...

269
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:12,670
I... don't want to fight you.

270
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:18,300
Vent all your anger with that
and come back to us.

271
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:20,190
Peh-yan.

272
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:39,070
Draken-kun!

273
00:20:39,850 --> 00:20:41,190
Draken-kun!

274
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,500
I'm in a hurry!

275
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:58,500
DAMMIT---!!!

276
00:21:00,330 --> 00:21:04,180
I can't find Draken-kun or Kiyomasa-kun.

277
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:07,350
Just where did the two of them go?

278
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:20,910
There he is.

279
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,600
I found him! Kiyomasa-kun!

280
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:29,600
I will kill Draken.

281
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:32,270
I will stop him no matter what!

282
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:45,340
I did it! I finally did it!

283
00:21:58,690 --> 00:22:00,060
Draken!

284
00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:01,660
Draken!

285
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:03,530
Draken-kun!

286
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:08,920
DRAKEN-KUN!

287
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:26,630
I just want to be right next to you

288
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:29,890
Next to your slightly sweaty shirt

289
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:35,430
The rain falls all of the sudden

290
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:38,980
So I kissed you on that lonely night

291
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:48,900
If you look back, I will always
be there and smiling at you

292
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,660
Please

293
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:57,160
Give up on that unachievable future

294
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:59,540
Take it now

295
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:01,580
In the real new world

296
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:06,380
If I have to give you a name,
it's "My Hero"

297
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:08,420
That straight wish

298
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:10,760
Will go beyond the stopped time

299
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:15,600
"I don't need anyone but you"

300
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:23,150
I will keep living here

301
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:31,820
Break down that crooked needle

302
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:34,070
Shout out that firm words

303
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:36,790
Kick away that unmeaning destiny
