1
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:07,120
Entering July this year, the temperature
on Mainland China is reportedly high.

2
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:10,300
The warm air is expected to flow to Japan
due to the current pressure pattern,

3
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:13,290
resulting in a higher average temperature
compared to previous years.

4
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:18,910
Sunny days will continue in Kanto-Koshinetsu
and Tokai region, showing bright summer sky.

5
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:22,960
The inland area is expected to experience
a sudden increase in temperature,

6
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:26,850
so be wary of sudden heavy rain
near the mountains.

7
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:28,980
Moving to the next news.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,430
Innocent civilians have fallen victim to the
growing dispute between the Tokyo Manji Gang.

9
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:39,430
-No way? Seriously? That's scary.
-Six were injured in the dispute,

10
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:42,760
with one person in cardiopulmonary arrest
has been taken to the hospital.

11
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:44,770
At the place of incident,

12
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:48,150
25 year old Naoto Tachibana who lives
in Shibuya-ku, Tokyo is confirmed dead

13
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:49,980
Naoto Tachibana?

14
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:53,080
along with Tachibana's older sister who
also lives in Shibuya-ku, Tokyo,

15
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:55,900
26 year old Hinata Tachibana.

16
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,260
The TMPD state they will be more
vigilant on the matter.

17
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:02,240
Hinata.... Tachibana?

18
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,690
It seems like the only girlfriend I had
in my life back during middle school,

19
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:14,960
Hinata Tachibana, has died.

20
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:18,910
Come on, I know you're in there!

21
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:21,160
Yes?

22
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:24,880
How many times do I have to tell you?
Your TV is damn loud!

23
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:26,820
I'm sorry.

24
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:29,730
Sheesh, kids nowadays.

25
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:39,060
How many times are you going to make me
say the same thing, Takemichi Hanagaki-kun?

26
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:43,810
When a DVD gets returned,
put it back on display immediately.

27
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:45,259
How many times have I said this?

28
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,160
-I'm sor...
-Yes. All you do is apologize.

29
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:55,759
That's really lame!

30
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:58,140
Hey, old fart!

31
00:01:58,170 --> 00:01:58,900
Eh?

32
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:00,680
You got a problem?

33
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:03,070
Eh? No, sorry...

34
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:11,880
-Idiot!
-Run! Run!

35
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:14,380
Hey! What are you doing?!

36
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:23,960
I didn't expect my life
would end up like this.

37
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:27,960
I live in a beat-up apartment
with thin walls.

38
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:31,340
My manager who's younger
than me treats me like an idiot.

39
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:35,880
Even kids made fun of me,
and I had to apologize for them.

40
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:40,140
I've only ever got one girlfriend in life,
and that was back in middle school.

41
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:43,079
Not to mention, I'm still a virgin.

42
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,510
Just where did I go wrong?

43
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:56,790
Eh?

44
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:04,100
No way...

45
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:08,510
At that moment when I thought
I'm about to die...

46
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:11,800
I didn't think of my family or friends.

47
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:14,560
I thought of Hinata Tachibana.

48
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:22,730
I heard Tachibana-san from
Class 2 likes you, Hanagaki.

49
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:24,020
Cool!

50
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:26,640
Seriously, why it's you?

51
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:30,310
What you gonna do? I saw some
boys checking up on her yesterday.

52
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,560
Who, you ask? It's Tachibana!

53
00:03:33,579 --> 00:03:35,780
She's really popular, you know!

54
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:40,000
Now that I think about it, my middle school
life in second grade was my hayday.

55
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,990
I was the Number 2 of a cool
second-year delinquent group.

56
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:46,780
The time when I had
the only girlfriend I'd ever get.

57
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,990
Could this be that? My life
flashing before my eyes right now?

58
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:01,430
Shibuya. You've arrived at Shibuya.

59
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:03,850
Watch out for any missing belongings.

60
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:05,260
Ah, I'm sorry.

61
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:06,850
Hey, Takemichi!

62
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,720
Takemichi!

63
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,070
What are you doing? We're going.

64
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:18,959
Hurry up.

65
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:21,820
Whoa, so nostalgic!

66
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,970
Makoto who's always
playing with his dick!

67
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,220
Dumbass Yamagishi who thinks
wearing glasses will make him smart!

68
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:29,200
Our leader, Akkun!

69
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:31,210
And my childhood friend, Takuya!

70
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,670
Yamagishi, did you see this week's magazine?

71
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:35,940
I saw it. The pics were hot, right?!

72
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:38,870
Can't you guys be more
serious once a while?

73
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:41,260
I'm hungry. Wanna grab something?

74
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:43,210
I want some hamburger.

75
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:44,880
I got coupons.

76
00:04:44,909 --> 00:04:46,590
-Enough for everyone?
-Nope!

77
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:48,210
Are you kidding me?

78
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:52,710
Eh?

79
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:54,790
Open-necked shirts and baggy pants?

80
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:57,610
Who is this lame delinquent?

81
00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:00,700
It's me! It's me from middle school!

82
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,490
So lame!

83
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:05,160
This was supposed to be
the peak of my life!

84
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:06,350
What's in my pocket?

85
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:09,530
A 500 yen coin and a cellphone!

86
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,340
It's a flip-phone!

87
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,000
How nostalgic!

88
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:17,380
July 4th, 2005?

89
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,980
Erm, if I remember correctly...

90
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:22,450
One... two... three...

91
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,790
It's today, 12 years in the past?!

92
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,350
Hey, Takemichi.

93
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:28,700
What are you doing?

94
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:32,220
Everything feels so real...

95
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:42,280
Really, Takemichi? Just fries?

96
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:43,890
And it's the small one!

97
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:47,000
Well, I need to save for
my train ride back home.

98
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:49,030
C'mon, that will work itself out.

99
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:53,300
I'm so glad that your cousin is
the leader of Shibuya Third Mid.

100
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:58,220
If the 3rd years come out, we can
just bring out Masaru-kun's name.

101
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:01,850
My cousin?

102
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,000
Are they talking about Masaru-kun?

103
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:09,410
Hold on a second, what good does
it bring by having Masaru-kun with us?

104
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:11,950
I don't really understand the situation here.

105
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:14,860
W-What?

106
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:17,390
-Are you okay in the head?
-Hey hey, Takemichi!

107
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:21,930
We're going to start a fight!

108
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:24,080
Bring it on!

109
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:28,680
Come to think of it, Masaru-kun did
say he's the leader at Shibuya Third Mid.

110
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:33,340
It's a war between us Mizo Mid 2nd year
and Shibuya Third Mid 2nd year!

111
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:34,970
Eh?

112
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:37,800
So we're on our way to that
middle school and start a fight?

113
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:41,540
Hey, someone, say something.

114
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:45,360
Takemichi, they're looking down on us.

115
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,740
We have no choice but to fight.

116
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:48,470
Looking down on us?

117
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:49,600
Just because of that?

118
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:52,030
We don't need that pussy act!

119
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:56,090
You gonna give them the backfist as
soon as you see them like always, right?

120
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:57,230
Backfist?

121
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:59,360
You're full of energy, after all.

122
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:01,440
Our charge commander!

123
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,510
Hey, you spilled that!

124
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:10,690
Wait... wait, wait!

125
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,730
Too fast! Too fast!
Everything moves too fast!

126
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:14,350
This certainly did happen.

127
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:19,540
I talked with my cousin Masaru-kun before
going to the middle school in Shibuya.

128
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:20,780
Hey!

129
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:22,640
Are you guys from Shibuya Third Mid?

130
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:25,060
-Ah, y-yes.
-What year you fools from?!

131
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:28,190
A fight, huh...

132
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:29,950
A fight?

133
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:32,510
I haven't done any in 10 years!

134
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:35,100
Shit... I think I will piss myself!

135
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:38,620
W-We're 1st year, so we don't
know anything about the 2nd year...

136
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:40,430
What? You're just 1st-year punks?

137
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,430
Do you even have
hair on your dick yet?

138
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:45,860
Was everyone around me
this really gung-ho back then?

139
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:47,820
Crap, I can't keep up with them!

140
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:50,040
C-Calm down!

141
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:53,340
This is just a flashback!
Nothing big!

142
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:55,320
That's weird.

143
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:57,420
There aren't any 2nd years here.

144
00:07:57,650 --> 00:08:00,820
Everyone we talked to
were 1st and 3rd years.

145
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:01,900
What's going on?

146
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:03,640
Gang boycott?

147
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:08,030
Or maybe they heard we're
coming and got scared?!

148
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:09,060
Could be!

149
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:13,610
I remember this park...

150
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:19,880
Well, those Shibuya delinquents are
whipped and trendy "city boys" anyway.

151
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:23,300
Takemichi?

152
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:26,500
Trendy city boys?

153
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:30,920
No!

154
00:08:37,429 --> 00:08:40,559
So is it you guys who have been
meddling with our 2nd years?

155
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,350
These guys are the 3rd years!

156
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:50,390
The 2nd years are on a "school trip."

157
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:52,970
The rabble-rousing 3rd years!

158
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:55,150
A full-fledged....

159
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:57,490
Delinquents!

160
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:02,660
Anyway, we will beat you all
to a pulp one by one.

161
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:03,800
Line up.

162
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:08,070
You guys are the 3rd years, right?

163
00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:13,160
We already talked our way through
with the 3rd year leader, "Masaru-kun."

164
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:15,830
Masaru?

165
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:21,500
Hey, Masaru!

166
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:24,970
You don't have to yell that loud,
I can hear you...

167
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:28,100
Go buy juice for every
one of us here, Masaru!

168
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:31,050
Umm...

169
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:32,260
And the money?

170
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,910
My "fist" worth 100 yen a pop, you know?

171
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:40,660
Let's see... one... two...

172
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:41,870
I'll pay for it!

173
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:49,290
Hey, Takemichi!

174
00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:51,520
That's right.

175
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:54,300
Masaru-kun was a gofer.

176
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,910
He was just showing off to me,
his younger cousin.

177
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:02,630
I remember what will happen after this.

178
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:07,590
We were terrified and have
lost our last ray of hope.

179
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:21,080
Hey, wake up you punks!

180
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:23,000
And they beat the shit out of us.

181
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,020
We're very sorry!

182
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:36,010
Lame punks with no guts like you have
no right to call yourself a delinquent.

183
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:40,600
From now on, you shits are
soldiers of the Tokyo Manji Gang.

184
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:42,850
So work your asses off.

185
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:48,180
That hurts...

186
00:10:56,010 --> 00:10:57,410
Are you guys okay?

187
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,850
Tokyo Manji Gang...

188
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:05,240
That's right... it all started from here.

189
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:10,540
The hellish days they used
us like their slaves.

190
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:12,720
Each and every one of us.

191
00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:18,510
That's why I ran away from my hometown
right after I graduated from middle school.

192
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:21,960
I started living by myself
and did part-time jobs.

193
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:24,610
But I couldn't do anything right.

194
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,830
I'm sorry!

195
00:11:26,890 --> 00:11:27,840
I apologized.

196
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:29,240
I'm so sorry!

197
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:30,550
And apologized.

198
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:32,360
And apologized.

199
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:35,270
I spent the rest of my life apologizing.

200
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:41,400
Dammit!

201
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,390
This is the worst!

202
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:47,920
The worst flashback to get
at the end of my life!

203
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,550
I got it, God!

204
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:53,490
You're trying to say that my
life totally sucked, right?!

205
00:11:57,730 --> 00:12:00,570
You will surely succeed, Hanagaki-kun!

206
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,300
Tachibana...

207
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:07,050
Tokyo Manji Gang...

208
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:09,450
That's right.

209
00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:14,040
Tachibana died because of those
guys 12 years in the future!

210
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:21,240
Even if I know that now,
it has nothing to do with me.

211
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:25,420
Eh?

212
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:26,830
Tachibana...

213
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,370
O-Ouch.

214
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,980
Are you okay, Takuya?

215
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,970
Don't you dare telling
anyone I cried.

216
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:36,930
Dammit!

217
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:43,790
I'm hungry.

218
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:45,670
I wanna eat some Katsudon.

219
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:48,220
My mouth is all swollen,
I can't eat anything.

220
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:54,020
Takemichi?

221
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:56,010
What's wrong, Takemichi?

222
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,920
Sorry, I gotta go.

223
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:03,360
Eh? Go where?!

224
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:13,920
Tachibana...

225
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:16,620
How did she look again?

226
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:26,440
It's here.

227
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,690
Tachibana... Tachibana...

228
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:32,470
Found it!

229
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:46,980
Yes?

230
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:49,170
Eh? Hanagaki-kun?

231
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:50,910
Ah... yeah.

232
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:53,820
I remember this voice.

233
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,220
Hanagaki-kun?

234
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,020
Did you get into a fight again?

235
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:02,980
You shouldn't go fighting
all the time, you know?

236
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:06,570
You just fought like last week
over small stuff!

237
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:08,420
Are you okay?

238
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,150
That looks painful.

239
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:11,870
Have you disinfect it already?

240
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,960
You're swollen all over the places.

241
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:15,750
Should I bring you some band-aid?

242
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:17,740
Hinata...

243
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:19,690
Tachibana.

244
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:29,680
Huh?

245
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:35,190
Why am I crying?

246
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:38,440
Sorry, it's nothing.

247
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:39,570
I'm going home now.

248
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:41,070
Hanagaki-kun!

249
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:42,350
Well...

250
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:45,280
I just wanted to see your face, that's all.

251
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:47,460
No way. Did something happen?

252
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,810
You're acting different than usual.

253
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:56,740
Eh?

254
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:58,560
Tell me.

255
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,950
I want to know everything about you.

256
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:05,510
I'm your girlfriend, you know?

257
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:07,250
Dummy.

258
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:09,100
Sorry.

259
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:11,270
That's right.

260
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,550
She always yelled at me.

261
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:16,390
She was tiny and strong-willed.

262
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:20,470
Bye bye! See you at school tomorrow!

263
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:25,020
I loved the cheerful way she says "Bye bye."

264
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:28,380
And yet I've already forgotten about that.

265
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:32,850
Dammit!

266
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:39,340
That's not everything, is it?

267
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:41,150
Don't you lie to us!

268
00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:42,890
Jump up and down.

269
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:47,670
See, you still got somethin'.

270
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:49,440
So goddamn noisy.

271
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:51,950
Can't they see someone here's
basking in sentimentality?

272
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:53,250
Take it out already!

273
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:55,040
Stop dilly-dallying!

274
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:55,980
Hey!

275
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:59,150
Shut the hell up, you dimwits!

276
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:07,260
All you ever do is bitching around
like some broken toy!

277
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:13,200
I'm super pissed right now.

278
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:15,010
Get lost.

279
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:16,560
Or I'll kill you.

280
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:18,810
W-We're so sorry!

281
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,230
E-Excuse us!

282
00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:27,970
U-Umm...

283
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:32,890
You shouldn't leave sharp stuff
on the ground like that.

284
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:35,680
Aah... sorry.

285
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:40,610
Thank you very much.

286
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:52,000
Listen up. When you cross people
like them, you need to have some guts.

287
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:54,230
Be prepared to get punched.

288
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:55,380
But don't flinch.

289
00:16:57,540 --> 00:16:59,500
You don't have to write it down.

290
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,660
Anyway, face them head-on.

291
00:17:02,650 --> 00:17:05,810
Half-assed guys will definitely
be scared by that.

292
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:07,540
Okay!

293
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:10,319
Guts and preparedness.

294
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:13,150
It's all stuff I don't have in
my own life, too.

295
00:17:13,859 --> 00:17:15,020
Well...

296
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:17,280
What's your name?

297
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:20,569
Tachibana... Naoto Tachibana.

298
00:17:20,829 --> 00:17:24,230
Eh? Could you be Tachibana's younger brother?

299
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:26,050
I do have an older sister.

300
00:17:26,069 --> 00:17:28,300
Really? You should've just said that earlier!

301
00:17:28,329 --> 00:17:31,140
Are you one of my sister's friends?

302
00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:35,230
Naoto Tachibana.

303
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:39,250
That's right. This guy will die
in the next 12 years, too.

304
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:42,560
I'm Takemichi Hanagaki.

305
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:44,250
You can call me Takemichi.

306
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:46,580
Ah, okay. I won't call you that, though.

307
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,110
Do you like your sister?

308
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:50,820
Eh? Why all of the sudden?

309
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:52,270
I don't like her!

310
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:54,300
Really? Why?

311
00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:55,770
Why, you ask?

312
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:59,830
She's always so noisy, telling
me what I should do all the time.

313
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:01,710
I see.

314
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:06,300
But you should take care of your sister.

315
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:11,610
I loved your sister.

316
00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:16,520
I loved her so much I just couldn't help it.

317
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:19,660
And I remembered that today.

318
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:25,540
I bet you don't get what I'm saying.

319
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:30,660
This might sounds crazy, but...

320
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:36,190
Today, in 2017, I fell off the station
platform onto the tracks.

321
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:39,320
I thought I was dead, but when
I realized, I was a middle schooler.

322
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:41,520
I'm back to when I was 12 years ago.

323
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:43,770
What do you call this?

324
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:44,910
A time leap?

325
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:46,660
Yes, that!

326
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:50,340
I might be just seeing a really long dream.

327
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:52,320
But...

328
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:57,910
I'm sure God is letting me meet
Tachibana one last time.

329
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:00,410
Eh? What do you mean?

330
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:04,380
On July 1st, 12 years from now on,

331
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:07,890
your sister... will die.

332
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:13,320
And you will die with her
at the same time.

333
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,910
July 1st, 2017.

334
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,820
Remember that date, Naoto.

335
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,050
And protect your sister.

336
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:25,810
Just kidding.

337
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:28,630
I'm sure it's hard for you to believe this.

338
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:34,580
If all of this is real,
I want to change the future.

339
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:41,120
I've fallen so far that I forgot about
her until the day of her death.

340
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:46,920
I feel helpless and frustrated.
I want to redo everything.

341
00:19:50,050 --> 00:19:51,650
I'm counting on you.

342
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:00,150
I understand.

343
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:15,890
He's finally awake.

344
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:18,490
Umm... where am I?

345
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:20,120
The station medical office.

346
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:22,960
You fell off the station platform
onto the tracks.

347
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:28,180
July 4th, 2017!

348
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:30,740
So I was just dreaming?

349
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:32,850
Eh?

350
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:36,810
I was saved from that situation?

351
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:38,640
I didn't even have a single scratch!

352
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:42,100
May I speak with him alone
for a moment?

353
00:20:42,290 --> 00:20:43,340
Yes.

354
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,660
He's the one who saved you.

355
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:46,870
Eh?

356
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:49,860
Long time no see.

357
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:53,920
Who are you?

358
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:55,890
I'm Naoto Tachibana.

359
00:20:57,550 --> 00:21:00,720
You changed my fate that day.

360
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:03,380
Eh? That day?

361
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,320
But shouldn't you be dead?

362
00:21:05,810 --> 00:21:07,860
You just leaped through time.

363
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:12,910
You saved me and I was able
to save you, Takemichi-kun.

364
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:17,560
By leaping through time,
you changed the present!

365
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:23,240
Takemichi-kun.

366
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:27,380
Today, 12 years ago, you said this to me.

367
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:30,060
Remember that date, Naoto.

368
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,910
And protect your sister.

369
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:37,510
I studied my hardest and
became a police detective.

370
00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:40,090
To protect my sister.

371
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:42,590
T-Then, what about Tachibana?

372
00:21:44,610 --> 00:21:46,560
I'm sorry, Takemichi-kun.

373
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,640
My sister...

374
00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:50,480
...died.

375
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:54,670
I did everything I could think of!

376
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:57,640
And yet... yet...

377
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:00,340
Please help me out.

378
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:04,060
I'm sure you can save my sister!

379
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,570
I can...

380
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,900
...save Tachibana?

381
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:16,960
We got our collars grabbed
and took an intense punch

382
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:21,840
After some beaten up
Together we crouched

383
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,260
The anticipated rain came

384
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:32,600
“This should clean your bruise”
you lied with a smile

385
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:40,600
Even though you're bad at argument

386
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:45,820
So stop making such lame jokes

387
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:50,950
It's so bad I teared up

388
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:58,540
Getting blue bruises all the time
I cry, cry, and cry

389
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:05,210
Leaning our unstable heart together

390
00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:09,880
We fight against the rotten Bad End

391
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,640
I wonder why

392
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:19,770
The pleasant pain was more vivid,
even more than the happiness

393
00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:24,400
Clicking our tongue over our wet clothes

394
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,780
We look at each other's face and laugh

395
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:39,960
The Revenge we swore in that rainy night
