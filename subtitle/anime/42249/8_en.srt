1
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:04,260
You bastards...

2
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:10,760
I'm losing my patience now!

3
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,650
Takemichi's lost it!

4
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:16,379
This is bad!

5
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:20,370
You've taken my precious memories...

6
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:24,790
Goodbye, Takemichi!

7
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:28,780
...and trashed them!

8
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:36,110
We got our collars grabbed
and took an intense punch

9
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:41,020
After we got beaten up
Together we crouched

10
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:43,440
The anticipated rain came

11
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:51,780
"This should clean your bruise"
you lied with a smile

12
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:59,780
Even though you're bad at argument

13
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:05,000
So stop making such lame jokes

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,130
It's so bad I teared up

15
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:17,720
Getting blue bruises all the time
I cry, cry, and cry

16
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:24,390
Leaning our unstable heart together

17
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:29,060
We fight against the rotten Bad End

18
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:30,820
I wonder why

19
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:38,950
The pleasant pain was more vivid,
even more than the happiness

20
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:43,580
Clicking our tongue over our wet clothes

21
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:46,960
We look at each other's face and laugh

22
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:59,140
The Revenge we swore in that rainy night

23
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:09,860
I didn't notice...

24
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:13,210
Don't screw with me!

25
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,180
Are you okay, Takemicchi?

26
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:26,140
SHUT UP!!!

27
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,410
You don't even care about
my memories, don't you?!

28
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:30,370
Well, well, just chill, okay?

29
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,250
Just chill?! Screw that!
It was you guys who started this!

30
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,280
Takemichi!

31
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:36,390
Takemichi!

32
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:39,000
Stop it, Takemichi!
Do you want to die or something?!

33
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:41,040
Shut up! Let go of me!

34
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:43,850
Do you even care about people around you?!

35
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:45,250
I'm sorry, okay?

36
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,700
I didn't mean to hurt you.

37
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,350
That's because you don't even care!

38
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:51,140
Just stop it already, Takemichi!

39
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:54,490
You don't care about anyone...

40
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:56,610
That's why you're fighting, right?

41
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,340
Takemichi?

42
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:12,820
I bet you don't even know how much trouble
you cause for everyone when you fight.

43
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:14,440
It's not just about you....

44
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:21,220
Everyone who looks up to the
two of you will start fighting, too!

45
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:23,620
It's not just the problem
between you two!

46
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:27,030
Everyone in Toman is going
to be split in half!

47
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:29,380
That's just sad!

48
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,250
I don't want that!

49
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:33,890
I don't want to see that happen!

50
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:37,450
I want you guys to be cooler than that.

51
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,600
Takemicchi...

52
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:47,920
Forget it! Just leave already!

53
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:52,730
Listen... this whole time...

54
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,770
You got poop on your head.

55
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,430
EEEH?! What the heck is this?!

56
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:04,670
That's gross, Takemicchi!

57
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:07,280
Why didn't you tell me sooner?!

58
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:11,160
Because you were being so serious!

59
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:13,370
Of course I was serious!
You guys are--

60
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,840
Let's run, Ken-chin! The poop is coming!

61
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:16,940
Gross!

62
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,600
Eh?

63
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:24,680
They made up?

64
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:28,740
But man, my head stinks.

65
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,000
What should I do with this...

66
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:34,680
-Crap!
-You stink!

67
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:37,520
-Run!
-Don't you run away from me!

68
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:40,870
You guys are so cruel!

69
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:45,860
That was hilarious.

70
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:48,250
It has been a while since
I laughed this hard.

71
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:50,000
And it was stinky as hell.

72
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:52,680
I already washed my hair, okay?

73
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:58,850
I'm sorry, Mikey.

74
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,360
It's fine.

75
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,930
I'm sorry, too.

76
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:06,180
But why were you
guys fighting, anyway?

77
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:09,280
-I forgot.
-I forgot.

78
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:15,550
But Ken-chin's right.

79
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:19,080
Pah turned himself in.

80
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:25,800
I'll turn myself in.

81
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,910
Mikey wanted to free
Pah-chin from his crime.

82
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:32,770
Even though he knew that'd be wrong.

83
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:37,110
Mikey who wanted to save
Pah-chin as his friend.

84
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:40,500
Draken who wanted to
respect Pah-chin's resolve.

85
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,600
They both have principles
they refuse to bend,

86
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:45,450
and that's why they started fighting.

87
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:52,780
Let's have a huge party
when Pah gets out.

88
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,170
Let me in.

89
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,290
Really?!

90
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:19,580
Toman is cool as I thought!

91
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:20,940
Takemichi!

92
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:22,730
You were awesome!

93
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,360
You actually made those two stop fighting!

94
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:28,220
You're the best!

95
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:36,310
Since I made them stop fighting,
the dispute won't happen.

96
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:38,570
And on August 3rd...

97
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:40,800
...Draken won't die.

98
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:45,760
I changed the past.

99
00:06:46,909 --> 00:06:48,690
Mission complete!

100
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:50,409
I did it!

101
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:51,930
Naoto!

102
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:54,300
Takemichi-kun!

103
00:06:56,409 --> 00:06:57,530
Hina?!

104
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,690
I'm here too.

105
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,660
What's wrong?

106
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:03,560
Well...

107
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:05,800
C'mon, just ask him.

108
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:09,730
Are you free on August 3rd?

109
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:11,110
Eh?

110
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:12,590
Well...

111
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:16,010
She's saying she wants to go
to the festival with you!

112
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:20,910
Yes! I'll go!

113
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:24,860
See? Told you he will say yes.

114
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:26,390
He's your boyfriend, isn't he?

115
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:31,540
Eh?!

116
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,990
Whoa! Mikey-kun, you're good!

117
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:36,070
Yo, Emma!

118
00:07:36,409 --> 00:07:38,120
Eh? You guys made up?!

119
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:40,640
What happened? You two
were so mad at each other!

120
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:42,070
Emma, shut up.

121
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:43,570
Did we?

122
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:45,840
I was worried, you know!

123
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:07,160
(August 3rd, 2005)

124
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:14,980
Sorry, kept you waiting!

125
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:20,180
You sure did.

126
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:24,890
Naoto, I'm sorry.

127
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:26,850
Please wait a little bit longer.

128
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:29,630
I do deserve a little reward, don't I?

129
00:08:37,419 --> 00:08:38,260
Hey.

130
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,250
Hurry up.

131
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:41,610
Got it!

132
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:46,200
Let's go, they'll leave us behind.

133
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:47,500
Yeah!

134
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,760
That! That! I want to eat that!

135
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:53,760
Huh? You'll get fat.

136
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:54,990
Leave it.

137
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:56,690
Eh?! Why?!

138
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,460
-Eh?
-Sheesh.

139
00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:00,520
Do your best, Emma-chan!

140
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:01,840
Eh?

141
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,410
I'm cheering on Emma-chan.

142
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,840
I mean, Draken-kun hardly
paid any attention to her.

143
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:11,250
Even though she's so cute.

144
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:13,810
Since when you become
friends with Emma-chan?

145
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:15,880
When I was helping her out.

146
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,830
Emma-chan is a pure girl.

147
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:22,600
But she's so in love with Draken-kun that
she goes a little out of control sometimes.

148
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:26,000
Like when she tried to do "that" with you.

149
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:31,690
Eh?

150
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:33,780
I still haven't forgiven you for that.

151
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:36,680
I understand Emma-chan's feeling now.

152
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:38,430
But I'm not forgiving you yet.

153
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,190
Well, but that was...

154
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:41,280
Cheater.

155
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:44,000
I-It wasn't like that! Hear me out!

156
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:47,300
Let's do that.

157
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:49,450
Huh? Shooting range?

158
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:52,330
If you hit the grand prize,
I'll forgive you.

159
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:55,020
You said it.

160
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:14,650
I'll make her forgive me!

161
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:21,490
(Knock down the target
for the fabulous prize)

162
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:27,750
Dammit!

163
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:30,420
I'm sure he did something
to make it stuck or something.

164
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:37,520
It's raining!

165
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:48,280
Hina! Over here!

166
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:50,480
I'm all wet.

167
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,150
Dang it!

168
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:54,530
I spent a lot of time
doing my hairdo today!

169
00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:02,340
Now it's just the two of us...

170
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,680
It's not stopping...

171
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:10,980
Yeah...

172
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,760
What is it?

173
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:16,530
I think my geta are the wrong size.

174
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:18,640
Ah! You're bleeding!

175
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:21,020
Are you okay? Can you walk?

176
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:22,930
Ouch!

177
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:32,380
That was close.

178
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:35,860
I'm sorry! Are you okay?!

179
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:41,600
Don't move.

180
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:42,970
Eh?

181
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:51,790
I'll forgive you.

182
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:53,300
Eh?

183
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:59,240
Because you were really wonderful,
doing your best back then.

184
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,320
C-Could this be...

185
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,550
...she's giving me the go sign?

186
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:16,900
She's telling me
I can kiss her now, right?

187
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,800
I will do it...

188
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:23,560
I will do it!

189
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:25,250
I will do it!!!

190
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:28,360
Takemichi-kun...

191
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:32,760
Your phone's ringing.

192
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:35,680
Who called me at such an important moment?!

193
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:36,910
Hello?!

194
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:38,490
Oh, Takemichi?

195
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,360
Man, what a rain, isn't it?

196
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:42,240
Yamagishi...

197
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:45,590
You bastard, don't call me
for crap like that!

198
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:48,670
I'm having my life-changing
moment right now!

199
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:51,400
Are you with Mikey-kun
and Draken-kun right now?

200
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:55,770
I was with Draken-kun a while ago.

201
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:58,690
Mikey-kun said he couldn't come today.

202
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:00,540
What about that?

203
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:04,600
-Sorry, Hina. It's Yamagishi.
-Then tell Draken-kun to be careful for me.

204
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:06,250
Eh? Why?

205
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,670
I just got this new intel.

206
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:13,640
I heard some guys from Mikey faction
in Toman are targeting Draken-kun.

207
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:15,750
Eh? What do you mean?

208
00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:18,310
I mean, the two of them already made up!

209
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:22,300
But seems like not everyone
agrees with what happened.

210
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:24,800
Looks like some guys even
got heated up because of it.

211
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:27,390
The second big dispute is about to start.

212
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:32,280
The dispute... still hasn't ended!

213
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:36,040
Hey, Takemichi, are you listening?

214
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:38,980
What's wrong?

215
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,690
No, it's nothing.

216
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:47,700
I'm sorry Hina!
Please wait here for a bit!

217
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:49,390
-Eh?
-I'll be right back!

218
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,840
Takemichi-kun?!

219
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:54,220
Sheesh! You will catch a cold!

220
00:13:56,990 --> 00:13:58,570
Draken-kun!

221
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:01,260
Dammit! I got carried away!

222
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:05,070
I thought the dispute will end
once they stop fighting!

223
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:08,280
On August 3rd, Draken will die!

224
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:11,170
Today is August 3rd, dammit!

225
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:13,310
Draken-kun!

226
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:17,050
Why? Why did I let my guard down?!

227
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:31,300
Toman?

228
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:32,990
Are they with Mikey and others?

229
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:35,780
Eh?

230
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,930
Why is Toman meeting up with Moebius?

231
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,620
Are you prepared?

232
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:42,340
Yeah.

233
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:49,910
I lost everything because of him.

234
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:51,970
Kiyomasa-kun!

235
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:59,450
I will kill Draken.

236
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:04,800
So the culprit who killed
Draken was Kiyomasa?!

237
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:12,790
Look what I found!

238
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:14,950
Let go of me!

239
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:24,260
The hell? What's Hanagaki doing here?

240
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,010
Kiyomasa-kun...

241
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:29,660
Why are you trying to kill Draken-kun?

242
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Huh?

243
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:33,180
Oi, Hanagaki!

244
00:15:33,890 --> 00:15:35,750
Buy us some juice.

245
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,690
Huh?

246
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:40,430
Get me a coke.

247
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:45,070
Eh?

248
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:47,200
My body is shaking...

249
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:50,760
I want coffee.

250
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:52,320
Where's the answer?!

251
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:55,240
I'm sorry!

252
00:15:55,890 --> 00:15:58,490
Why am I apologizing?

253
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:01,700
A slave like you don't have
the luxury to worry about others.

254
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:04,360
Looks like this guy need
some training to know his place.

255
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:06,900
That's right.

256
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:09,730
I didn't get stronger or anything.

257
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:12,720
By hanging out with Mikey-kun
and others,

258
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:15,970
I deluded myself into thinking
I have become stronger.

259
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:25,230
This is... who I am.

260
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:34,990
I'm very sorry.

261
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:39,020
Hey, get the duct tape.

262
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:51,040
Your eyes.

263
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:53,330
I hate it.

264
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:55,490
You don't understand a damn thing.

265
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:59,610
Once this is over, I will
blame everything on you.

266
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:02,420
Just lay there like a caterpillar.

267
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,589
You scum.

268
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:26,480
Takemichi-kun!

269
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,540
Takemichi-kun!

270
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:38,930
What is this? What happened?

271
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:41,170
Stay still, I'll peel this off.

272
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:55,570
Sorry for leaving you alone like that.

273
00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:00,550
I'm so pathetic.

274
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:02,830
Takemichi-kun...

275
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:06,680
I tried as hard as I could.

276
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:08,860
It's painful.

277
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,340
It's exhausting.

278
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:12,520
But I tried my best.

279
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:14,340
And yet...

280
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:17,170
And yet I can't change a damn thing!

281
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:19,070
I can't save anyone!

282
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:24,470
Of course I can't.

283
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:30,580
Just how can someone as worthless
as me save anyone?

284
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,870
How stupid am I?

285
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:35,810
That's not true.

286
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,240
Leave me alone!

287
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:40,340
I don't want you to see me
so pathetic like this!

288
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:43,580
If I were Draken-kun, or Mikey-kun,

289
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:45,870
I could've dealt with
those guys with no problem!

290
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:49,730
I'd just beat them up
and get the stuff done!

291
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,500
But I'm...

292
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:58,130
I'm just a garbage human.

293
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:13,850
It's my first kiss.

294
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:15,770
Why?

295
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:18,570
I give it to you because
you're special to me.

296
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:23,310
You're not Draken-kun nor Mikey-kun.

297
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:26,690
You are you.

298
00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:29,610
You would shed tears for others,

299
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:32,360
and you would worry about
others from the bottom of your heart.

300
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,320
You're Takemichi-kun.

301
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:38,140
There is no other guy as cool as you.

302
00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:56,890
Hina, thank you.

303
00:19:57,270 --> 00:19:59,230
I didn't do a thing.

304
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,730
I...

305
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:02,020
It'll be okay!

306
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:05,410
I'm sure you will succeed.

307
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:11,310
I'm so lame.

308
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:13,460
Don't cry again, okay?

309
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:14,670
I am not crying!

310
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,020
This is from the rain!

311
00:20:19,930 --> 00:20:22,380
I must go now.

312
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,490
This time for sure...

313
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:31,870
...I will stop Kiyomasa-kun!

314
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:33,990
And also...

315
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:38,570
I will put an end to this life trauma
I've been running away from!

316
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:44,310
Takemicchi?

317
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:45,530
Mitsuya-kun?

318
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:47,580
Eh? It's just you?

319
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:48,830
Where's Draken?

320
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:52,250
This is bad, Mitsuya-kun!
Draken-kun gonna get attacked!

321
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:53,960
Yeah, I know.

322
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:55,820
Eh? You knew?!

323
00:20:55,910 --> 00:20:57,300
And how'd you know?

324
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,950
-By Kiyomasa-kun!
-By Peh-yan, right?

325
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:00,800
-Huh?
-Eh?

326
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:07,040
Mikey tried to save
Pah-chin with money.

327
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:09,540
But Draken was against it.

328
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:14,600
Not even us captains can stop them
from fighting, so how'd you do it?

329
00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:17,050
Well, about that...

330
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:21,920
Thank you.

331
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:25,870
If you hadn't stopped them,
Toman would be in big trouble.

332
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:28,320
I didn't do a thing.

333
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:29,980
What a modest guy.

334
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:33,120
And plus, the situation
is still as crucial.

335
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:35,250
What is it?

336
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:37,450
I knew it, it's Peh-yan's bike.

337
00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:38,580
Eh?

338
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:41,210
Thanks to you, everyone
in Toman agreed that

339
00:21:41,210 --> 00:21:45,640
nothing could be done
about Pah-chin's arrest.

340
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:48,800
Peh-yan is the only one
who couldn't let it slide.

341
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:52,210
Should I give Hina-chan a quick call?

342
00:21:52,330 --> 00:21:55,480
Wouldn't they already go
home because of the rain?

343
00:21:56,090 --> 00:21:57,110
Draken!

344
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:03,090
Oh, Peh, what's up?

345
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:04,860
What's with the sash?

346
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:26,670
I just want to be right next to you

347
00:22:26,670 --> 00:22:29,930
Next to your slightly sweaty shirt

348
00:22:29,930 --> 00:22:35,470
The rain falls all of the sudden

349
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:39,020
So I kissed you on that lonely night

350
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:48,950
If you look back, I will always
be there and smiling at you

351
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:50,700
Please

352
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:57,200
Give up on that unachievable future

353
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,580
Take it now

354
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:01,630
In the real new world

355
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:06,420
If I have to give you a name,
it's "My Hero"

356
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:08,470
That straight wish

357
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:10,800
Will go beyond the stopped time

358
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:15,640
"I don't need anyone but you"

359
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:23,190
I will keep living here

360
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:31,860
Break down that crooked needle

361
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:34,120
Shout out that firm words

362
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:36,830
Kick away that unmeaning destiny
