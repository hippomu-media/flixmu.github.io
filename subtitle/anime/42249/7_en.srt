1
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:05,330
Moebius that, Moebius this.

2
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:08,670
Could you please stop yelling
our name so many times?

3
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:15,260
You mid-school babies.

4
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:18,720
You are... Osanai!

5
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:22,730
I heard you guys were planning
to pick a fight with Moebius.

6
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:30,110
So we come to you ourselves.

7
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:34,700
-Let's do this.
-Dance, mid-schoolers.

8
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:36,570
Look, they're so scrawny.

9
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:38,910
This is war.

10
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:50,710
Pah-chin!

11
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,670
We come here for you.

12
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:58,640
Mikey-chan from Mid-School Infant Alliance.

13
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,190
This is bad.

14
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:20,620
The dispute between Toman
and Moebius will start!

15
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:28,039
We got our collars grabbed
and took an intense punch

16
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:32,960
After we got beaten up
Together we crouched

17
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,380
The anticipated rain came

18
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:43,720
"This should clean your bruise"
you lied with a smile

19
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:51,729
Even though you're bad at argument

20
00:01:51,729 --> 00:01:56,950
So stop making such lame jokes

21
00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:02,080
It's so bad I teared up

22
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:09,669
Getting blue bruises all the time
I cry, cry, and cry

23
00:02:09,669 --> 00:02:16,340
Leaning our unstable heart together

24
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:21,010
We fight against the rotten Bad End

25
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:22,760
I wonder why

26
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:30,900
The pleasant pain was more vivid,
even more than the happiness

27
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:35,530
Clicking our tongue over our wet clothes

28
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:38,900
We look at each other's face and laugh

29
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:51,079
The Revenge we swore in that rainy night

30
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,890
A surprise attack of this scale
against mid-schooler?

31
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:08,680
You're as scummy as
I imagined, Osanai-kun.

32
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:12,310
Huh? Can't hear ya', pipsqueak!

33
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:17,820
Like he imagined?

34
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:19,900
He's completely different
from what I imagined!

35
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:24,070
12 years in the future
and now...

36
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:26,120
Is he really the same person?

37
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:28,950
What happened that made him like that?

38
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,540
Hey.

39
00:03:30,579 --> 00:03:34,000
Why are you staring at me like that?

40
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:36,130
W-Well...

41
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:44,470
You were looking down on me, weren't you?

42
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:50,100
I hate that look more than anything else!

43
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,400
Your opponent is me, bastard.

44
00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:00,530
Stop it, Pah-chin.

45
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,740
You must not fight Moebius.

46
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:12,540
Back off.

47
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:18,880
You better not underestimate
Pah-chin, Hanagaki.

48
00:04:19,339 --> 00:04:22,340
Pah-chin is a full on fighter,
even among those in Toman.

49
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:28,550
He's the kind of guy who takes on
an entire team empty-handed and wins.

50
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:32,270
There's no way he would lose
to someone like Osanai!

51
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:36,440
That's not the problem here.

52
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:40,530
At this rate, Draken will die!

53
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:44,610
Then Akkun and Hina will...!

54
00:04:47,159 --> 00:04:49,200
Even though I must stop them...

55
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:52,290
Dammit!

56
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:54,659
Takemicchi.

57
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:58,250
Just stay still and watch.

58
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:01,050
This is Pah's fight.

59
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,890
What's wrong?

60
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:18,900
You practice boxing, don't you?

61
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:27,030
Oh no! He took a clean hit!

62
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:36,620
You can't even kill an ant
with a punch like that!

63
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:40,290
This is bad! He's going to pass out!

64
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:42,090
No way!

65
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:45,510
What is he? A monster?!

66
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:48,470
-Pah-chin!
-Peh!

67
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:52,010
I told you to stay still and watch.

68
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:55,980
Sorry, Mikey.

69
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:58,230
Stay still and watch?

70
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,940
Aren't you being too cruel, Mikey-kun?

71
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:05,860
Pah-chin's nose just broke and
he's seconds away from passing out!

72
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:09,860
This won't end well! Pah-chin will die!

73
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,820
Let's stop them!

74
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:14,160
Why?

75
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:16,700
He hasn't given up yet.

76
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:19,460
He's smiling?

77
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:21,960
That's awful, Mikey-kun

78
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:24,960
This is nothing but a torture.

79
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:29,340
That's nasty.

80
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:38,020
Look, this guy passed out
while standing!

81
00:06:58,450 --> 00:07:00,370
Sorry.

82
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:04,840
Mikey.

83
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:08,510
I'm...

84
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:11,340
...so pathetic.

85
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:14,300
What are you talking about, Pah-chin?

86
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:18,390
You didn't lose.

87
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:24,270
The heck are you saying?

88
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:27,480
How the hell did he not lose?

89
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:30,110
What nonsense are you talking about?

90
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:34,200
Hey, Mikey! Hurry up and
get down on your knees!

91
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:36,830
Not like we'll forgive you, though!

92
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:38,740
All of you, strip naked and dogeza!

93
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:40,750
Try not to piss your pants, okay?

94
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:43,790
You can cry all you want,
but we ain't gonna forgive you!

95
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:46,380
Get ready for a spanking!

96
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:52,090
You want some?

97
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:54,180
Mikey?

98
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:57,640
Not even Mikey-kun can
take on a guy like him.

99
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,350
You will be dead in 10 sec--

100
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:11,820
Eh?

101
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,040
All of you who thinks
Pah-chin lost, step forward.

102
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:29,800
I will kill you.

103
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,929
Toman belongs to me.

104
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:37,010
As long I'm still standing,

105
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:41,520
we will never lose.

106
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:50,400
Sorry, Ken-chin.

107
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,820
I did it.

108
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:59,370
Nothing can stop you, right, Mikey?

109
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,670
Osanai!

110
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:10,290
Mikey, watch out!

111
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:11,380
Draken!

112
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:16,130
Osanai!

113
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,310
Osanai.

114
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:32,230
Let me tell you why you lost.

115
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:38,320
It's because you strayed
from the way of delinquents.

116
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:46,960
You attacked a guy's parents
and raped his girlfriend.

117
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:49,500
Those are things only a scum would do.

118
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:54,590
You hear me? If you dare to do
such scummy things ever again,

119
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:57,590
we will track down every single
one of you and kill you.

120
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:00,300
These guys are nuts!

121
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:03,470
Are they seriously mid-schooler?

122
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:07,520
Our boss Mikey just defeated your boss!

123
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:10,310
Any of you got a problem with that?!

124
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,650
If there isn't any,
then from today onward,

125
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:19,530
Moebius will be under the command
of Tokyo Manji Gang!

126
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:24,700
Amazing! They won!

127
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:29,330
So this is how Toman got big?

128
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,210
Hey!

129
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:34,420
Let's run!

130
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:36,300
Crap, the cops are coming.

131
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:38,170
Eh? You mean the police?!

132
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:40,590
Are they here to celebrate our victory?

133
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:43,930
Let's run, Takemicchi!

134
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:45,260
Ah, yeah!

135
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:47,850
Why are you so relaxed?

136
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:49,270
Hey, Moebius!

137
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:55,820
Don't run away by yourself,
give Osanai here a help.

138
00:10:58,190 --> 00:10:59,400
Yes!

139
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,160
That dispute was merely the trigger.

140
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:09,710
That's what Osanai said,
but everything is over without trouble.

141
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:12,670
Does that mean this is not over yet?

142
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:19,670
A trigger? Did I miss something?

143
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:33,850
I can't forgive you just like that.

144
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:35,610
Osanai.

145
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:46,370
What are you doing, Pah?!

146
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:57,920
Pah...

147
00:11:58,130 --> 00:11:59,340
You...

148
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:03,430
Pah-chin... where did you get that knife?

149
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:05,970
Eh? He stabbed him?

150
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:09,310
Osanai! Osanai!

151
00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:11,350
Osanai-kun!

152
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:14,440
Are you kidding me?
That guy seriously just stabbed him!

153
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:29,160
Run, Pah!

154
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:31,870
Sorry.

155
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:33,960
Mikey.

156
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:37,880
Peh-yan.

157
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:40,630
I'm leaving the 3rd Squad to you.

158
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:45,050
I'll turn myself in.

159
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:49,180
Stop screwing around!

160
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:52,100
Don't just stand there, Mikey!

161
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,980
Pah! Come with us!

162
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:56,980
They will catch all of us!

163
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:58,730
Pah!

164
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:19,540
Dammit! Why this happened?!

165
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:23,880
Oh no...

166
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:25,630
My consciousness...

167
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:33,140
Takemicchi!

168
00:13:57,330 --> 00:13:59,250
Where's this?

169
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,680
Perv.

170
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:19,810
Emma-chan?! Wait!
That was a complete accident!

171
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:23,520
Hospital?

172
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:25,820
That's right!

173
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:28,780
I lost my consciousness.

174
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,580
Ah, what about Mikey and others?

175
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:35,080
Is everyone okay?

176
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:37,910
I got a call from Draken.

177
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:41,000
And when I come, you're here.

178
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:43,920
Where's Draken-kun?

179
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:49,260
He started fighting with Mikey-kun.

180
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:52,300
Eh? Does that mean...

181
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:55,680
F-Fight? Why?

182
00:14:55,890 --> 00:14:57,520
I don't know.

183
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:00,310
But it gets serious every single time.

184
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:03,860
Now there's like a Mikey faction
and Draken faction,

185
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:06,320
and Toman got split into two.

186
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:08,530
No way...!

187
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:12,280
Everyone was arguing over
Pah-chin getting arrested.

188
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:15,370
And they started fighting...

189
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:18,200
The infight in Toman...

190
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:23,380
With that fight as the trigger, everything
happened exactly like Osanai said.

191
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:27,590
All while I was unconscious!

192
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:32,470
Emma-chan, don't cry.

193
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:36,600
Draken will be fine, right?
I don't understand anything anymore.

194
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,680
Takemichi-kun, are you okay?!

195
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:47,570
What is this?! Lewd?

196
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:50,530
What do you mean?

197
00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:54,820
T-This is not what it seems, Hina!
This is just--

198
00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:08,000
It's now August 1st.

199
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,970
Toman has been split in two.

200
00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:17,180
At this rate, the infight will
happen just like Osanai said.

201
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:20,720
And on August 3rd, Draken will die.

202
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,770
During all that, I've been
sleeping because of my injuries.

203
00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:26,060
I did it.

204
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:31,860
I have so much free time that
I completed a giant 2,005-piece puzzle!

205
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:35,360
What an meaningless sense
of accomplishment...

206
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:41,080
Oh man, you're out of bed already?

207
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:43,790
How are we supposed
to meet pretty nurses now?

208
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,210
Are you really okay now?

209
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:49,380
You were told to take proper rest, right?

210
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:51,960
-Where's your porn?
-Well, I'm feeling good enough.

211
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:55,260
Do you know anything about
Mikey-kun and Draken-kun?

212
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:57,850
Well, yeah, kinda...

213
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:02,140
Is it really that bad?

214
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:06,730
-What's this?
-It's so detailed!

215
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:08,650
Looks like you can move this piece.

216
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:10,900
Hey, don't touch that!

217
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:13,859
It took me three days to finish that!

218
00:17:14,109 --> 00:17:16,530
-Eh?
-So you were bored, huh.

219
00:17:16,530 --> 00:17:18,240
It can't be helped, okay?

220
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,450
The doctor told me I should
not leave my house and rest.

221
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:24,750
Takemichi, it's really serious.

222
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,500
Mikey and Draken.

223
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,170
Really?

224
00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:30,170
It's already the point of no return.

225
00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:33,340
They say it's only a matter of time
for Toman to split in two.

226
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:36,550
As I thought...

227
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:45,230
Eh? What is it?

228
00:17:45,770 --> 00:17:47,690
Sorry, we were just joking.

229
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:52,150
They're fighting for sure,
but I heard it's no different from usual.

230
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:54,110
Seriously?!

231
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:57,610
Besides, there's no way Mikey-kun and
Draken-kun would argue with each other.

232
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:02,330
Who'd you say is arguing with who?

233
00:18:02,530 --> 00:18:05,540
D-Draken-kun?!

234
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:09,500
I came to check up on you, Takemicchi.

235
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:12,340
This room is hot as hell.

236
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:14,880
Is it 'cause it's full of dudes?

237
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:18,010
Huh? Why are you guys standing for?

238
00:18:18,050 --> 00:18:21,100
I bought watermelon. Let's eat it.

239
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:23,350
Y-Yes!

240
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:33,650
Pah won't get out for at least a year.

241
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,150
What about Osanai?

242
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:38,240
He's alive.

243
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:41,320
If he doesn't, Pah will get
locked until he's adult.

244
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,580
What about Mikey-kun?

245
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:47,450
That bastard is full of crap!

246
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:51,250
Ah, sorry.

247
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:55,090
My three days of hard work!

248
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:58,260
Didn't I already apologize?

249
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:00,180
Yes, I'm fine now.

250
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:04,050
I only spent three days
losing sleep to finish it.

251
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:09,060
Anyway, I'm cutting my ties with Mikey.

252
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,730
Toman's over.

253
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:16,280
W-What are you saying?
Toman's over?

254
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:19,320
-You're kidding, right?
-I'm going now.

255
00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:21,570
Please wait!

256
00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:23,030
Draken-kun!

257
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:26,830
So that story about Toman
splitting into two...

258
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:28,500
...was for real?

259
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:33,460
The infight is actually happening!

260
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:34,790
I must stop them!

261
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:39,300
What do you mean by Toman's over?
Please explain the situation to me!

262
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:45,550
Hey!

263
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:54,560
Huh? Why are you here?

264
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:58,530
Huh? More like, why are you here?

265
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:01,320
Mikey-kun?!

266
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:04,240
This bad! This bad!

267
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:06,030
Mikey-kun's here!

268
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:08,330
At the worst timing!

269
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:10,080
Critical situation!

270
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:13,460
I'm here to check on Takemicchi.

271
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,380
Same goes for me.

272
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:18,340
Huh? Takemicchi is my buds.

273
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:21,670
He got nothing to do with you.
Isn't that right, Takemicchi?

274
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,430
Eh? Well...

275
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:25,470
Huh? What are you talking about?

276
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:28,470
You're my best buds, right?
Takemicchi?

277
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:32,020
Move out, you useless meat wall.
You're blocking the way.

278
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:35,310
Huh? You move, pipsqueak.

279
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:39,070
W-Wait! Please wait, both of you!

280
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:40,230
Huh?

281
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,320
He's trying to get between them!

282
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,910
Does he have a death wish or something?!

283
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:47,120
Just right after he survived the last fight!

284
00:20:47,370 --> 00:20:51,080
I don't know what happened,
but fighting is no good!

285
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:53,460
So both of you, please calm down!

286
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,330
Hey.

287
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:59,590
Who do you think you are?

288
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,050
So scary!

289
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:04,630
It's impossible!
I can't stop them from fighting!

290
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:12,180
He finally listened?

291
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:16,850
Mikey-kun?!

292
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:19,820
That's my precious bike, Hayate!

293
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:25,200
My memories!

294
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:28,990
Are you freaking insane?

295
00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:30,580
Draken-kun!

296
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:34,410
That's the golden bat I hit my first home
run with in my 4th year of elementary!

297
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:36,500
If you wanna start this,
then I won't hold back!

298
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:40,590
Mikey-kun!

299
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:44,090
That's the lantern I got from the
first festival my dad took me to!

300
00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:47,430
That's my precious skateboard that
I bought after saving up my allowance!

301
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:56,310
You wanna finish this here?

302
00:21:57,810 --> 00:21:59,770
Bring it on.

303
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:04,900
You bastards...

304
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:09,200
I'm losing my patience now!

305
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:26,670
I just want to be right next to you

306
00:22:26,670 --> 00:22:29,930
Next to your slightly sweaty shirt

307
00:22:29,930 --> 00:22:35,470
The rain falls all of the sudden

308
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:39,020
So I kissed you on that lonely night

309
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:48,950
If you look back, I will always
be there and smiling at you

310
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:50,700
Please

311
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:57,200
Give up on that unachievable future

312
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,580
Take it now

313
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:01,630
In the real new world

314
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:06,420
If I have to give you a name,
it's "My Hero"

315
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:08,470
That straight wish

316
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:10,800
Will go beyond the stopped time

317
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:15,640
"I don't need anyone but you"

318
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:23,190
I will keep living here

319
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:31,860
Break down that crooked needle

320
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:34,120
Shout out that firm words

321
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:36,830
Kick away that unmeaning destiny
