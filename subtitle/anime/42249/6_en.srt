1
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:05,980
Mikey, we're here.

2
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:09,000
What the hell you guys are here for?

3
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:12,590
Don't you dare to show
your face here! Get lost!

4
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:15,110
Who do you think you're talking to--

5
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:17,460
Hey, what are you doing?!

6
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:20,070
It's all our fault.

7
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:26,400
Just what did she even do to you guys?

8
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:35,380
We're going to fight Moebius soon.

9
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:39,990
The problem in our world is something
we must deal with ourselves.

10
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:45,200
All of our members have families
and people they care about.

11
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:48,500
You don't have to force yourself to bow.

12
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,410
Have a heart and care about others.

13
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,810
Sorry, Ken-chin.

14
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:56,900
I...

15
00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:00,020
...am glad that you're here with me.

16
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:30,050
Can you call Pah-chin tomorrow?

17
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:32,800
Okay. I'll go get Peh, too.

18
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:35,229
In the warehouse near Second Mid, right?

19
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:37,100
I'm counting on you.

20
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:45,600
See you.

21
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:04,160
There is no way Mikey and Draken
will fight each other.

22
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:07,440
Draken died on August 3rd.

23
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:12,140
I must look up about Moebius before then!

24
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:19,030
We got our collars grabbed
and took an intense punch

25
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:23,940
After we got beaten up
Together we crouched

26
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:26,360
The anticipated rain came

27
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:34,700
"This should clean your bruise"
you lied with a smile

28
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:42,700
Even though you're bad at argument

29
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:47,920
So stop making such lame jokes

30
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:53,050
It's so bad I teared up

31
00:02:53,050 --> 00:03:00,640
Getting blue bruises all the time
I cry, cry, and cry

32
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:07,310
Leaning our unstable heart together

33
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:11,980
We fight against the rotten Bad End

34
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:13,740
I wonder why

35
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:21,870
The pleasant pain was more vivid,
even more than the happiness

36
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:26,500
Clicking our tongue over our wet clothes

37
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:29,880
We look at each other's face and laugh

38
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:42,060
The Revenge we swore in that rainy night

39
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:48,890
I was born in the
red-light district in Shibuya.

40
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,800
I don't know who's my dad.

41
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,650
My mom's is a prostitute.

42
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:56,950
She left me when I was two.

43
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:01,150
I lived in "Fashion Health."

44
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:03,660
Sign here, okay?

45
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:05,050
Got it.

46
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:07,780
You sure are big now, Ken-bou.

47
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,260
I drink milk every day, after all.

48
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,760
Then see you again next time.

49
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:14,910
Kay~

50
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,579
Morning~

51
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:17,880
Thank you.

52
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:19,180
Thanks.

53
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:22,340
You should go to school now, Ken-bou.

54
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:23,830
Want a blowjob?

55
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:25,290
No need.

56
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,410
See you~

57
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:27,670
Yeah.

58
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:30,600
I was in fifth grade of elementary school.

59
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:34,860
I grew up surrounded by pink
towel and the smell of lotions.

60
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,270
Good morning!

61
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:39,980
Good morning, Ken-kun!

62
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,290
It's not "Ken," it's Draken.

63
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,770
Are you sure about this?

64
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:52,630
Of course.

65
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,860
Putting a tattoo on your temple
gonna hurt, you know?

66
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:56,850
Just do it fast.

67
00:04:58,250 --> 00:04:59,600
Suit yourself.

68
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,080
I'll start now.

69
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:13,810
Shut it. You're a man, aren't you?

70
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,270
THAT HURT!!!

71
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,560
There, it's done.

72
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,190
So cool!

73
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:36,140
A tattoo at such a young age.

74
00:05:36,159 --> 00:05:37,990
You're not gonna grow up
into a proper adult.

75
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:40,550
Thank you!
I'll show this off to everyone!

76
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,500
It will take a while before
your swell goes off.

77
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:47,090
Got it!

78
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:51,920
My body was bigger than
normal middle schooler.

79
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:59,750
I'm Ken Ryuguji from Fourth Elmn!

80
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:01,290
Draken!

81
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:04,480
If you see my dragon tattoo,
you better hide.

82
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:08,950
I was in fifth grade when
I had my dragon tattoo.

83
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:12,660
Even for middle schoolers,
there was hardly anyone dared to fight me.

84
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:16,300
Ken.

85
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:19,230
Aren't you being too
full of yourself lately?

86
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:22,380
You're picking too much fight
with middle schoolers.

87
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:24,130
Want us to beat you again?

88
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:25,660
I'm sorry.

89
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:28,990
They're the Samayama Gang
who ruled this area.

90
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:32,330
They once beat me up and left
me with only my pants on.

91
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,620
Not even I would dare to
fight them again ever since.

92
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:40,360
Speaking of not knowing his place,
there's a brat from Seventh Elmn.

93
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,300
Ah, you mean Mikey?

94
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:46,720
The one who got famous after
he beat Shino from Bachikan?

95
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:54,310
Ken.

96
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:56,140
Bring Mikey to us.

97
00:06:57,650 --> 00:06:59,250
That brat is a lunatic!

98
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:04,850
Not even I feel like I can win against
a high schooler, much less a strong one.

99
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:08,340
If I bring him to them,
he wouldn't even stand a chance!

100
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:12,840
But before that,
I want to fight him first!

101
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:20,290
Hey!

102
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:22,720
You're from Seventh Elmn, right?

103
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:23,930
Y-Yeah?

104
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:27,060
I'm looking for this kid called
"Mikey," do you know him?

105
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:29,140
If you're looking for him,
then just now...

106
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,790
Ah! Mikey-kun!

107
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:43,920
What?

108
00:07:44,409 --> 00:07:46,340
He's different from what I imagined!

109
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:49,800
I thought he would be a giant
monster who's bigger than me!

110
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,350
This guy's tiny!

111
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,060
He's just an ordinary brat!

112
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:54,580
He's coming!

113
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:56,490
What should I do?
Should I punch him?

114
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:00,070
Hey.

115
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,660
Don't you think the name
"Forty-eight tricks" is weird?

116
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,200
Eh?

117
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:12,180
No matter how you think about it,
there's barely a forty of it.

118
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:13,940
What do you think?

119
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:17,830
W-What do I think?
I never even heard of that.

120
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:21,670
Erm, you're Mikey, right?

121
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,400
Yeah, that's right.

122
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:24,540
What is it?

123
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:28,320
Some dudes from middle school
asked me to take you to them.

124
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:29,480
Huh?

125
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:30,710
Well...

126
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:32,110
I won't force you.

127
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:33,110
Okay!

128
00:08:33,309 --> 00:08:34,110
Eh?

129
00:08:34,309 --> 00:08:36,840
I'll come along because you asked me.

130
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:40,890
I'll go put my stuff at school first.

131
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:48,820
What a weird guy.

132
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,280
He gets me off the mood.

133
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:54,920
I bet this squirt will get beaten
up in no time.

134
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,100
Hey~

135
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:04,630
I brought him.

136
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,050
This guy's Mikey--

137
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:10,100
That moment...

138
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:13,040
Mikey ran straight towards Samayama...

139
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:17,530
And jumped.

140
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:39,660
You people couldn't do anything
unless you're in a pack.

141
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,160
What do you want?

142
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:51,500
I'm the great Mikey from Seventh Elmn.

143
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,540
Incredible!

144
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:57,420
You're Draken from Fourth Elmn, right?

145
00:09:58,290 --> 00:10:03,230
Why a cool kid like you hanging
out with scum like them?

146
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:07,560
You should be my friend.

147
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:09,410
Ken-chin.

148
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:35,150
Are you sure Osanai is here, Naoto?

149
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:38,170
You got back all of the sudden
and asked me to investigate.

150
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:39,980
You think I have enough
time to fact check?

151
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:41,450
Sorry about that.

152
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:42,690
It's an emergency.

153
00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:43,890
Huh?

154
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,020
And that info you gave me about Mikey-kun
and Draken-kun fighting was total bunk!

155
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:52,130
There is absolutely no way
those two would fight each other.

156
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:58,310
And instead, a battle between Toman
and Moebius is about to begin in the past.

157
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:01,460
So Ryuguji would die in that dispute.

158
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:02,870
Yeah.

159
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:07,120
That's why if we can learn about
the dispute from Osanai here,

160
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:10,390
we might be able to find a clue
on how to prevent Draken's death.

161
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:12,200
Umm, excuse me.

162
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,270
Can you please let me through?

163
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:17,990
Ah, I'm sorry.

164
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:20,120
Thank you, I'm sorry.

165
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:23,480
But you sure are one hell of a cop, Naoto.

166
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,270
Please be vigilant, okay?

167
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:26,710
You're late, Osanai!

168
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:28,350
Eh?

169
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:29,540
Osanai?

170
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:32,650
Why are you taking leisure time eating?!

171
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:35,070
But I came back on time...

172
00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:36,730
If you can't do your job well,

173
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:38,530
you should at least
work more than others!

174
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:40,280
That guy is Osanai?

175
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,280
The former president of Moebius?

176
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,340
You sure this isn't some mistake?

177
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:52,060
Let's try asking him.

178
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,380
Umm...

179
00:11:57,770 --> 00:11:59,290
Did I do something?

180
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,760
No.

181
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:04,560
We're investigating the Tokyo Manji
Gang incident from a few days ago.

182
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:09,910
12 years ago,
as the president of Moebius,

183
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:12,160
you started a dispute with
the Tokyo Maji Gang, right?

184
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,480
Can you tell us--

185
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:24,190
I have nothing to talk about.

186
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:28,040
You were involved in Ken Ryuguji's death.

187
00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:31,080
No, that is...

188
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:34,370
A member of Moebius stabbed him.

189
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:36,760
No.

190
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:39,850
It was your order to kill him, wasn't it?

191
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:41,020
No!

192
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:00,610
It's true.

193
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,070
We did fight Toman.

194
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:05,660
But it wasn't us who killed him.

195
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:08,740
That was merely the trigger.

196
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:12,460
That man started an infight in Toman.

197
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:13,800
Eh?

198
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:15,770
Then, on August 3rd...

199
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,210
Draken died.

200
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:22,720
All of that was part of that man's scheme.

201
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,340
That man?

202
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:28,910
I'm sorry.

203
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:31,240
I can't tell you any more than this.

204
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:35,000
I don't want to get involved with Toman.

205
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:40,830
I'm sorry.

206
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,960
My boss will yell at me

207
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:44,920
I'll be going now.

208
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:49,250
I'm sorry for taking your time.

209
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:51,180
T-Thank you!

210
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:55,580
If only Draken hadn't die...

211
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:57,260
Then I...

212
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:07,070
What do you think?

213
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:09,930
Seeing how frightened he looks,

214
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,050
it doesn't seem like he's lying to us.

215
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:14,810
If we take his words at face value,

216
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:18,190
then the fight with Moebius
is nothing but the trigger.

217
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:23,510
According to him, someone was
plotting to start an infight in Toman.

218
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:25,840
And Osanai was being used for that.

219
00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:27,570
That means...

220
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:31,320
there was someone who wanted to
make Draken and Mikey fight each other?

221
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:33,340
Why would anyone...

222
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:37,250
Anyway, the dispute with
Moebius was the start of it all.

223
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:40,520
That means Toman must not fight Moebius.

224
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:41,870
We must stop them!

225
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,120
Yes.

226
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:45,570
Please tell Mikey about this.

227
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:48,310
Yeah, I'll try to convince him.

228
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:57,200
Yamagishi is always like that.

229
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:59,830
He farted right when it was getting good.

230
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:02,440
He always makes trouble, doesn't he?

231
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:06,030
What's wrong, Takemichi?

232
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:09,830
Akkun!

233
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:13,260
Please save everyone.

234
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:15,610
Our crybaby hero.

235
00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:18,030
Hey, Takemichi!

236
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:20,500
Sorry, I wasn't listening.

237
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:24,530
Safe!

238
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:28,220
Hey, what are you laughing?!

239
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:29,470
I see!

240
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:30,880
He's still alive!

241
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:33,340
Also, you didn't listen
to me again, did you?

242
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:34,720
Your front! Front!

243
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,600
Akkun.

244
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:51,560
Akkun, do you have a dream?

245
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,660
Why are you acting so
"adolescent" all of the sudden?

246
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:56,720
Just tell me.

247
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,490
My dream?

248
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:01,580
To be a beautician, I guess?

249
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:04,830
You should become one.

250
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:07,270
What are you talking about?

251
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:09,130
I'm not even sure of it yet.

252
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:14,070
You will definately become one!

253
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:17,760
C'mon, stop that.

254
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,180
What's wrong with you, Takemichi?

255
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:22,940
I'll be cheering for you.

256
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:26,590
So you better become one.

257
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,020
O-Okay...

258
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:33,070
Akkun, I must go now.

259
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:35,200
Eh? Where are you going?

260
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,740
It's an urgent matter.

261
00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:39,380
I will be you first customer.

262
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:41,110
O-Okay...

263
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,130
Great! It's a promise, okay?!

264
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:47,080
Then see you tomorrow.

265
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,710
I want to save Akkun.

266
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:53,750
I want to save Draken.

267
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:57,940
I want to save Hina.

268
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:02,350
I must stop the dispute with Moebius!

269
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,180
Mikey-kun!

270
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:20,440
No matter what, I will stop it!

271
00:17:21,109 --> 00:17:23,270
What is it, Takemicchi?

272
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:25,510
Why are you here?

273
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:27,670
You again?

274
00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:29,450
Get lost, shithead!

275
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:36,970
Sorry, but we're having
an important discussion here.

276
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:45,700
Can you stop this fight with Moebius?

277
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:48,800
Huh?

278
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:54,320
I can't tell you why, but there's
someone pulling the strings here.

279
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,590
That hurt...

280
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:02,990
You really should stop goofing around.

281
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:04,410
Isn't that so, Pah-chin?

282
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:05,910
Get lost.

283
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:08,060
One more word and you're dead.

284
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:12,040
I understand, Draken.

285
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,920
I won't start off on my own.

286
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,250
So how should we attack them?

287
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,570
You can't!

288
00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:19,090
You guys must not fight Moebius.

289
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:21,730
Toman will get trapped.

290
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:26,250
Get up.

291
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:32,910
We can't fight and you can't say why?!

292
00:18:32,930 --> 00:18:36,690
Then who the hell beat my friend
and raped his girlfriend?!

293
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:38,480
I don't know!

294
00:18:38,570 --> 00:18:39,640
But...!

295
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:40,920
Takemicchi.

296
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,120
I get what you're saying.

297
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,160
We will fight Moebius.

298
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,850
You don't understand at all.

299
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:57,040
I've decided that we're gonna fight.

300
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:00,210
So Toman's gonna fight Moebius.

301
00:19:15,010 --> 00:19:16,900
I can't back off!

302
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:19,830
If you guys fight Moebius,
Toman is done for!

303
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:24,070
Just when I finally become friends
with Mikey-kun and Draken-kun!

304
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:28,130
I don't want Toman to end like this!

305
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:31,750
You're really a moron!

306
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:34,440
What are you doing, Draken?

307
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:40,650
Takemicchi said he won't back off.

308
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:44,060
Maybe it's not a bad idea to first
see what Moebius is all about.

309
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:45,390
Mikey.

310
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:46,570
Huh?

311
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:49,660
Ken-chin, are you defying Toman?

312
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:50,980
Huh?

313
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:52,790
That's not what this is about.

314
00:19:52,810 --> 00:19:54,480
Yes it is.

315
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:11,540
Sorry to interrupt your
little group implosion.

316
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:15,660
Moebius that, Moebius this.

317
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:19,140
Could you please stop yelling
our name so many times?

318
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:25,550
You mid-school babies.

319
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:28,850
You are... Osanai!

320
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:29,980
(8th President of Moebius - Nobutaka Osanai)

321
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,270
Shut it, dick cheese.
(8th President of Moebius - Nobutaka Osanai)

322
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:33,640
Eh?

323
00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:35,820
That Osanai?!

324
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:41,830
You bastard...!

325
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:45,450
Hey, I'm two years older than you.

326
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:47,130
That's Mr. Bastard to you.

327
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:57,680
Yub, nothing but a middle schooler punk.

328
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:00,040
Tokyo Manji Gang?

329
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:01,920
You should change your name.

330
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,980
To "Mid-School Infaint Alliance."

331
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:12,270
I heard you guys were planning
to pick a fight with Moebius.

332
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:29,390
So we come to you ourselves.

333
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:32,310
-Let's do this.
-Dance, mid-schoolers.

334
00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:34,040
Look, they're so scrawny.

335
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,600
Mikey-chan!

336
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,390
We're surrounded?!

337
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,650
This is war.

338
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:59,610
Anyway, the dispute with
Moebius was the start of it all.

339
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:02,900
That means Toman must not fight Moebius.

340
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:04,480
We must stop them!

341
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:08,260
This is bad, what should I do?

342
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:26,710
I just want to be right next to you

343
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:29,970
Next to your slightly sweaty shirt

344
00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:35,510
The rain falls all of the sudden

345
00:22:35,510 --> 00:22:39,060
So I kissed you on that lonely night

346
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:48,980
If you look back, I will always
be there and smiling at you

347
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:50,740
Please

348
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:57,240
Give up on that unachievable future

349
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:59,620
Take it now

350
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:01,660
In the real new world

351
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:06,460
If I have to give you a name,
it's "My Hero"

352
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:08,500
That straight wish

353
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:10,840
Will go beyond the stopped time

354
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:15,680
"I don't need anyone but you"

355
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:23,230
I will keep living here

356
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:31,900
Break down that crooked needle

357
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:34,150
Shout out that firm words

358
00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:36,870
Kick away that unmeaning destiny
