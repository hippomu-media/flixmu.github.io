1
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:10,810


2
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:12,740
You guys listen up!

3
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:15,350
This person sitting behind me!

4
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:17,710
He's the new 3rd Squad Captain!

5
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:19,630
Tetta Kisaki!

6
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:27,690
Hey, hey, what is going on?

7
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:31,080
Looks like this is getting interesting.

8
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:38,320
What are you doing here, Baji?

9
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:41,810
You've been banned from our
gatherings for causing that infight.

10
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:45,870
Since I ruined your precious gathering,

11
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,730
will you finally kick me out this time?

12
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:51,100
What? What is this guy talking about?

13
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,690
You don't need troublemaker, right?

14
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:55,720
Mikey.

15
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:57,560
Baji!

16
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:00,320
I quit.

17
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:04,459
From now on, Keisuke Baji,
the 1st Squad Captain...

18
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:07,720
...will be Toman's enemy!

19
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,780
I have a favor for you, Takemicchi.

20
00:01:15,289 --> 00:01:16,289
Yes.

21
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,010
Bring Baji back from Valhalla for me.

22
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:21,670
Can you do that for me?

23
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:23,890
Yes!

24
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:26,060
If it's for you, of course!

25
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:27,690
But...

26
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:31,910
Can I also ask just one thing from you?

27
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:34,270
Kisaki...

28
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:37,380
Please expel him from Toman.

29
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:39,350
Okay.

30
00:01:40,009 --> 00:01:42,229
We will clash with Valhalla soon enough.

31
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:45,210
Your job is to get Baji back before then.

32
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:49,430
Prove that you're more useful than Kisaki.

33
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:35,170
Let's hurry!

34
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:36,910
Hey, don't run in the hallway!

35
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,310
Bring Baji back from Valhalla for me.

36
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:55,280
And if you fail...

37
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:57,340
I'll kill you.

38
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,000
What should I do?

39
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,740
Takemichi!

40
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,260
We heard the news.

41
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:06,940
So you became a member of Toman?

42
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:08,530
Akkun...

43
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,960
Hm? What's wrong?

44
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:15,640
You don't look so happy.

45
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:16,630
Eh?

46
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:18,370
Ah, th-that's right.

47
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:21,410
I became a member of Toman.

48
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,570
Just turned out that way.

49
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:25,130
Really? So what happened?

50
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:28,410
I can't look directly at Akkun!

51
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:32,200
The "Crybaby Takemichi" is now a Toman, huh.

52
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,510
Wish we could join, too.

53
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,780
It's not as good as you'd think.

54
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:49,100
We got our collars grabbed
and took an intense punch

55
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:54,010
After we got beaten up
Together we crouched

56
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:56,430
The anticipated rain came

57
00:03:56,430 --> 00:04:04,770
“This should clean your bruise”
you lied with a smile

58
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:12,770
Even though you're
bad at argument

59
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:17,990
So stop making such lame jokes

60
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:23,120
It's so bad I teared up

61
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:30,710
Getting blue bruises all the time
I cry, cry, and cry

62
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:37,380
Leaning our unstable heart together

63
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:42,050
We fight against the rotten Bad End

64
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:43,810
I wonder why

65
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:51,940
The pleasant pain was more vivid,
even more than the happiness

66
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:56,570
Clicking our tongue over our wet clothes

67
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:59,950
We look at each other's faces and laugh

68
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:12,130
The Revenge we swore in that rainy night

69
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:17,580
I see.

70
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:23,400
So unless you get that former 1st Squad
Captain named Baji-kun from Valhalla,

71
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,860
Mikey-kun will kill you?

72
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:26,940
Yeah.

73
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:30,530
And I only got time until
Toman's fight with Valhalla starts.

74
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:33,330
But no telling when
will that happen, right?

75
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:34,659
It can even be today.

76
00:05:34,659 --> 00:05:38,370
May you rest in peace, Takemichi.
I will pick up your bones.

77
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:43,330
To be honest, I don't know anything
about the situation inside Toman.

78
00:05:43,659 --> 00:05:46,420
Much less anything about Valhalla.

79
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:48,300
Hey, Gang Dex.

80
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:49,360
Huh?

81
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:51,470
Well, if you insist.

82
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:53,320
Let me explain!

83
00:05:55,909 --> 00:05:59,020
Tokyo Manji Gang, Toman for short.

84
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:02,640
Mikey-kun is the President
and Draken-kun is the Vice-President.

85
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:04,550
Under them are five squads.

86
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:07,340
Each squad has around 20 guys each.

87
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:10,760
They're a large Bosozoku
with 100 members total.

88
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,790
You know this much, right?

89
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:15,920
Wow. I didn't know that.

90
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:19,330
For real?
And you call yourself a delinquent?

91
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:20,430
Sorry.

92
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:23,510
Make sure you take a note.
This will be on the exam!

93
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:26,510
There! No chitchat!

94
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:28,090
He's totally on the role.

95
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:31,640
From what I've heard.

96
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:35,170
The former 3rd Squad Captain,
Pah-chin-kun got arrested.

97
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:38,810
And the Vice-Captain, Peh-yan-kun,
joined the 2nd Squad.

98
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:43,030
Eh? So Peh-yan-kun is
under Mitsuya-kun now?

99
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:44,230
Yeah.

100
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:46,270
We're in the same squad?!

101
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:48,520
I can't really handle being with him.

102
00:06:48,659 --> 00:06:49,890
Takemicchi!

103
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,170
His voice scares me.

104
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:55,380
And, in exchange,
the new 3rd Squad Captain is...

105
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:57,370
Kisaki!

106
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,190
Yes! The former Moebius member.

107
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:03,980
Moebius wasn't exactly one
solid group to begin with.

108
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:07,290
Apparently, there was tension between
Osanai's group, those born in 1998

109
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:11,160
and Kisaki's group, those born in 1990.

110
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:13,290
Hmm, I see.

111
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,890
I suppose a gang got
a lot going on inside them.

112
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:20,360
After Osanai lost to Mikey-kun,
Moebius is essentially disbanded.

113
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:24,730
Then, the 1990 group led
by Kisaki joined Toman.

114
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:29,050
Making Toman's numbers
jump from 100 to 150.

115
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:35,020
That makes Kisaki's 3rd Squad
way bigger than any others in Toman.

116
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:39,580
Toman needs Kisaki's strength
to move forward.

117
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:45,770
What about the 1988 group
who was with Osanai?

118
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:50,390
The remaining 88' and 89'
have gathered...

119
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,280
Under Shuji Hanma.

120
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:54,550
That guy?

121
00:07:57,290 --> 00:08:02,210
He did say he was Moebius's temporary
president during the battle of 8/3.

122
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,510
And Hanma gathered ex-Moebius members

123
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:08,220
along with anti-Toman force
to make a new gang named...

124
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:10,070
Valhalla.

125
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:12,970
Valhalla currently has 300 members!

126
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:15,230
300 members...

127
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,160
And Hanma is Valhalla's leader?

128
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:22,640
Hanma is the "acting president."

129
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:24,950
No one knows the real president.

130
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:27,370
The "face" of the President does not exist.

131
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:32,799
That's why people call Valhalla
as "The Headless Angel."

132
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:35,799
And Baji-kun joined that kind of gang?

133
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:38,470
To bring Baji-kun back to Toman.

134
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:41,330
I've got no choice but to
meet him in person.

135
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:44,010
But how?

136
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:46,050
Done.

137
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:47,730
Hey, you two.

138
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:50,820
Do you know what class
the 2nd-year Hanagaki is in?

139
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:52,940
-Eh?
-He is in class 3.

140
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:54,400
Hmm...

141
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,720
Thank you.

142
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:03,080
Since when we have such
a hottie in our school?

143
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:05,460
Going by his school shoe color,
he's a 3rd-year, right?

144
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:10,340
The ex-Moebius member are
under Hanma, Valhalla's No.2.

145
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:13,510
And the anti-Toman forced are under...

146
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:20,320
The No.3, Kazutora Hanemiya.

147
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:29,880
Eh?

148
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:43,330
Is school over already?

149
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:46,650
Who the hell are you?
You don't look familiar.

150
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:49,080
That's not very polite.

151
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,380
I'm actually your senior in this school.

152
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:54,660
Huh? Who are you?
Never seen you before.

153
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:03,090
That tiger tattoo on his neck!

154
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,840
Stop it, Makoto! This guy is...!

155
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:06,630
Huh? What is it?

156
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:10,270
Hey, you guys know Takemichi Hanagaki?

157
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,680
T-Takemichi...

158
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:14,080
That's him.

159
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:15,420
Huh?

160
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:16,950
Takemichi?

161
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:20,670
Th-This guy here is Valhalla's No.3!

162
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,370
Kazutora Hanemiya!

163
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:25,200
(Valhalla No.3 - Kazutora Hanemiya)

164
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:30,850
I'm so happy!

165
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,910
I had no idea there was someone
in Toman one grade below mine!

166
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:35,790
Okay, Takemichi!

167
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:37,820
-Eh?
-Let's go to Valhalla's hideout.

168
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:39,380
Huh? Valhalla?!

169
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:42,060
Hey! I found Takemichi!

170
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,560
Huh?

171
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:45,040
So that's the guy?

172
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:46,090
Yub.

173
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,310
Wh-Who are these guys?

174
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:51,660
Hmm? My most trusted junior.

175
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,200
I-I see...

176
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,880
Did anything happen?

177
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:57,530
They both on crutches...

178
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:59,800
Huh? I broke 'em yesterday.

179
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:00,960
Eh?!

180
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,910
But they're your most
trusted juniors, right?

181
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:04,930
Yeah.

182
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:07,330
You got a problem with Kazutora-kun?

183
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:08,410
No...

184
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:14,420
How can they be so calm
about having their legs broken?

185
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:17,590
In any case, this guy is
definitely a bad news!

186
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:20,280
Hurry up, Takemichi!

187
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:23,700
Valhalla's No.3, Kazutora Hanemiya.

188
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:26,980
Isn't it a bad idea to go
along with this guy?

189
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:28,740
We're going to the enemy's hideout!

190
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:31,160
Just relax!

191
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:32,950
I'll introduce you to everyone.

192
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:34,520
Everyone?

193
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:37,760
Could this be a chance to meet Baji-kun?!

194
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:41,570
But... I'm kinda scared.

195
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,390
Do you want to go to that
store I talked about before?

196
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:54,850
Yeah, let's go!

197
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,960
-I wonder what to eat today.
-Let's see...

198
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:57,950
Hina...

199
00:11:57,980 --> 00:11:58,910
I want to eat perfait!

200
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:00,000
Sounds good!

201
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:04,230
I promised back then.

202
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:07,810
That I'll do anything to protect you.

203
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,280
Valhalla's hideout.

204
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:14,950
Bring it on!

205
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:18,690
If I can bring Baji-kun back to Toman,

206
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:22,450
Mikey-kun promised me that
he will expel Kisaki.

207
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:25,240
As long as I can get
Kisaki out of Toman...

208
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:27,240
The future will change!

209
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:31,930
I won't let that future
happen ever again!

210
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:34,520
Watch me!

211
00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:36,160
Hina!

212
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:55,590
Who lets you walk around here?

213
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,860
Um...

214
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,390
Hanemiya-kun.

215
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:00,340
Hmm?

216
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:01,810
Just call me Kazutora.

217
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:04,010
Kazutora-kun.

218
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:07,570
You're a third-year at our school, right?

219
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:08,910
Yeah.

220
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:10,240
Umm...

221
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,580
I just figured everyone would
make a big deal knowing someone

222
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:16,250
as famous as you been
in our school all this time.

223
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:19,540
I only went for one semester as a first-year.

224
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:20,680
Eh?

225
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,130
I've been going to reform school.

226
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,160
Eh?!

227
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:29,050
Reform school...

228
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:31,640
You got arrested?

229
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:34,820
It was his fault.

230
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:38,040
Look, we're almost there.

231
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:39,700
His?

232
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:41,360
Who is he talking about?

233
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:45,670
Anyway, I must sneak into
Valhalla and take Baji-kun back!

234
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,020
Eh? In here?

235
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:52,410
Yub.

236
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:53,490
The arcade?

237
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:55,980
Already closed down
a long time ago, though.

238
00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:58,460
(No Trespassing)

239
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,860
Headless angel...

240
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:26,060
The atmosphere here is clearly
different from Toman.

241
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:45,740
Eh?

242
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:47,970
Baji-kun?!

243
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:51,090
Kazutora-kun...

244
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:53,810
What's going on here?

245
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:56,460
What do you mean?
It's a loyalty test.

246
00:14:56,490 --> 00:14:57,650
Loyalty test?

247
00:14:58,050 --> 00:15:00,370
We're testing Baji's belief.

248
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:03,940
If he wants to "switch religion"
from Toman to Valhalla,

249
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:06,170
he needs to show he's truly ready for it.

250
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:11,070
The guy Baji is punching right now
is Toman's 1st Squad Vice-Captain.

251
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:13,570
Baji's most trusted retainer.

252
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:15,620
1st Squad Vice-Captain?!

253
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:18,160
Toman is Valhalla's enemy.

254
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:24,610
If he's betraying his old "God," Mikey
then he needs to stomp his old beliefs.

255
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,650
Well?

256
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:40,670
Is this good enough for you, Hanma-kun?

257
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,130
For my initiation into Valhalla.

258
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:49,110
(Sin & Punishment)

259
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:55,120
You sure are something.

260
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,430
He was with you for a long time, right?

261
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,410
I'm impressed you can go that far.

262
00:16:03,010 --> 00:16:04,140
What?

263
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:06,600
I didn't come here to
listen to some dumb lectures.

264
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,110
Kazutora.

265
00:16:11,290 --> 00:16:12,500
Yeah?

266
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:15,570
Did you get him?

267
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:17,320
Yeah, this one.

268
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:19,300
He's Takemichi Hanagaki.

269
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:21,950
Toman's new member.

270
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:22,880
Eh?!

271
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:24,940
Am I gonna be...

272
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:27,090
...the next "loyalty test?"

273
00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:40,710
So you're Hanagaki?

274
00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:43,590
Step forward.

275
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:45,580
C'mon.

276
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:52,260
You're from that time?

277
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:54,630
You came here to get killed?

278
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:55,590
Kill him!

279
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:58,960
Kill him! Kill him!

280
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:02,780
Kill him! Kill him!

281
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:04,940
I came to bring Baji-kun back.

282
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,349
But now Baji-kun will kill me?

283
00:17:11,859 --> 00:17:17,910
One of Toman's founding members
and the 1st Squad Captain, Keisuke Baji!

284
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:22,579
He claims he wants to abandon
Toman and join Valhalla!

285
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:26,300
One of Toman's top-brass
wants to join Valhalla?

286
00:17:26,329 --> 00:17:27,460
Ain't that bad?

287
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,180
No, this is a huge deal.

288
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:30,890
Indeed!

289
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:33,180
This is a very serious matter!

290
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:38,770
Enlisting Baji will aid us
greatly in crushing Toman!

291
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:40,710
But!

292
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:44,570
We must first solve just
one remaining problem.

293
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:49,640
He might be one of Toman's spies!

294
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:55,290
So I had Kazutora
prepare a witness for us!

295
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:59,500
I will now summon the witness forward!

296
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:05,410
Takemichi Hanagaki.

297
00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:07,290
Y-Yes?

298
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:13,140
What did Baji over here say in
front of everyone at Toman's gathering?

299
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:15,190
Well..

300
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,720
"I'm joining Valhalla."

301
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:19,390
"Toman is my enemy."

302
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:20,850
That's what he said.

303
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:24,890
Kazutora, what do you think?

304
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:27,820
"Loyalty test" and "Witness summon."

305
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:29,930
I think that's good enough.

306
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:32,570
We can use Baji in a fight.

307
00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:35,670
And he knows a lot about
Toman while I was away.

308
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,880
I believe it's worth
letting him join Valhalla.

309
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:43,390
Are you sure, Baji?

310
00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:45,930
We will crush Toman.

311
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:47,750
And then...

312
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,340
We'll kill Mikey.

313
00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:55,910
Yeah.

314
00:18:58,130 --> 00:18:59,840
I'll help you with that.

315
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:00,960
Kazutora.

316
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:04,590
That's enough, right?

317
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:08,790
Okay!

318
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:13,680
From this day forward, Keisuke Baji
is a member of Valhalla!

319
00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:23,860
No way...

320
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,200
This is bad!

321
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:28,080
I'll never be able to get
Baji-kun back at this rate!

322
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,830
Please wait a minute!

323
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:34,460
Baji-kun, you helped found Toman
alongside Mikey-kun and the rest, right?

324
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:36,450
How can you betray them?!

325
00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:41,790
I won't betray Toman because
I'm a founding member?

326
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:45,220
What a joke.

327
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,910
That guy is a founding member too.

328
00:19:57,670 --> 00:19:59,520
The 6th guy in that picture!

329
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:01,590
So that was Kazutora-kun?!

330
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,660
Kazutora resented Toman.

331
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:07,440
I can never forget.

332
00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:08,840
In 2003.

333
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:11,230
That summer of our first year
of middle school.

334
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,130
We ran wild.

335
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:21,130
It was a bit chilly for a mid-summer day.

336
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:26,070
You got called out by Mikey, too?

337
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:27,300
Yeah.

338
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,150
Same place as usual, right?

339
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:30,350
(Baji - Age 12)

340
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:32,780
Give us your money!

341
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:34,410
Please stop...

342
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,990
-Ah.
-Eh?

343
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:38,980
Sorry.

344
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,170
We got late.

345
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:43,030
(Kazutora - Age 12)

346
00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:42,600
Baji hit some punks.

347
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:45,130
Hey, don't blame it all on me!

348
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,290
Whoa! So cool!

349
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:49,250
Oh, what is it?

350
00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:52,990
Toman's Tokko-fuku is done!

351
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,500
(Pah-chin - Age 12)

352
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,160
Oh, awesome!

353
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:56,520
Right?!

354
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:58,540
The decoration is so detailed!

355
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,410
This rocks, Mitsuya!

356
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:02,480
Don't give me that.

357
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:04,880
(Mitsuya - Age 13)

358
00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:04,880
I'm the one pushed to make 'em.

359
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:07,190
Alright!

360
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:10,160
Let's change into 'em and
take a commemorative picture!

361
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,310
(Draken - Age 13)

362
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:12,880
Right, Mikey?

363
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:16,980
(Mikey - Age 12)

364
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:16,180
Hm?

365
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:21,120
Ah! You bastard!
Why'd you eat all my chocolate parfait?!

366
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:22,690
Whoops, didn't notice.

367
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:25,590
You said you only wanted a bite!

368
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,490
You can just order another one.

369
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,560
That's not the problem here!

370
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:30,700
What do you mean?

371
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:33,660
I wanted to eat THIS chocolate parfait!

372
00:21:33,770 --> 00:21:36,400
-Aaah.
-What is it?!

373
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:38,420
You sure are persistent, huh.

374
00:21:38,450 --> 00:21:40,440
Huh?! You bastards!

375
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:42,510
-I'll beat--
-Thank you for the food!

376
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,830
Argh, fine!

377
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:49,700
Hey!

378
00:21:50,170 --> 00:21:52,170
H-Here goes.

379
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,770
Hurry up!

380
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:55,320
Y-Yes.

381
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:57,090
Say cheese!

382
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:08,060
I never could have imagined
the incident that happened next.

383
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:21,940
A sword is perfect for
an earnest fella like you

384
00:22:21,970 --> 00:22:25,420
You're a hero with no fire

385
00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:29,580
You are weak and powerless
in front of a gun

386
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:32,970
It's not something to take lightly

387
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:37,480
Just try it, just try it, just try it

388
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:40,150
There is no correct answer

389
00:22:40,170 --> 00:22:41,030
Mayday

390
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:44,350
Just a no no,
for a lazy lazy head

391
00:22:44,370 --> 00:22:47,990
Look, for a fast and furious
Be-bop lifestyle

392
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:51,290
Stagnate, daydream, it's bad no no NO

393
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:55,880
An obvious pray to god,
bye bye to next life

394
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:08,770
Your number of excuse is wonder

395
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:11,710
Vomiting prejudice and urge

396
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:14,830
Most emotions are soda

397
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:17,010
Say it

398
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,850
Just a no no,
for a lazy lazy head

399
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:24,530
Look, for a fast and furious
Be-bop lifestyle

400
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:29,080
Stagnate, daydream, it's bad no no NO

401
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:32,670
Goodbye bye bye to next life
