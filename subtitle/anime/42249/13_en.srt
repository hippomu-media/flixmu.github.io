1
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:09,410
Let's take a little walk, Takemichi-kun.

2
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:10,800
Okay.

3
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:17,480
This park takes me back.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,780
I came here with someone I liked.

5
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:22,590
I-I see...

6
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:24,010
On Christmas Eve.

7
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:34,220
Even now, I still can't forget that person.

8
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:35,500
Eh?

9
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:37,400
Why was I dumped?

10
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:39,660
I still don't get it.

11
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:45,410
Sorry! I-I need to go to the toilet!

12
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,430
I must change.

13
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:57,420
I will ask her out!

14
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:01,390
Eh?

15
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:03,730
You're not in the car?

16
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:09,720
Hina!

17
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:13,870
HINA!!!

18
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:16,380
Take... michi...?

19
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,530
Why... are you... not in the... car?

20
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:25,190
Akkun?!

21
00:01:27,789 --> 00:01:30,400
Hina! Let's get out of here!

22
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,310
My legs...

23
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:36,590
I can't... feel it anymore...

24
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:06,280
I will definitely save you!

25
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:08,190
No matter how many times I fail!

26
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:10,330
I will try over and over!

27
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:13,390
Until I reach the future where
you're saved...

28
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:15,720
I definitely won't give up!

29
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:34,530
Hina...

30
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:54,230
You always come without notice.

31
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:55,920
Hina!

32
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:01,890
I love you!

33
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:51,970
Umm, are you okay?

34
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:56,150
We understand your feeling.

35
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:59,660
But other people need their
turn as well, so please.

36
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,680
Umm...

37
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:06,240
Is there anything wrong?

38
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:08,500
Please, take a rest.

39
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,860
Umm, can you hear us?

40
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:43,640
Just why...?!

41
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,640
I thought everything went well!

42
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:49,130
Naoto...

43
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:52,909
Sis...

44
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:02,900
Takemichi Hanagaki-kun?

45
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,650
I'm Hinata's mother.

46
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:08,860
Long time no see.

47
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:11,200
How's Naoto?

48
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:12,470
He's fine.

49
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,640
He has calmed down a bit.

50
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,940
I see...

51
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:17,320
Thank goodness.

52
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:20,180
Here.

53
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:24,160
For me?

54
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,890
Open it.

55
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,350
This is...

56
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:36,540
It seemed to be her favorite.

57
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:40,380
She always wore it like
it's the most precious thing.

58
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:43,710
It was a gift from you, wasn't it?

59
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:01,860
She must've loved you very much.

60
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,500
Hina...

61
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:16,030
We got our collars grabbed
and took an intense punch

62
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:20,940
After we got beaten up
Together we crouched

63
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:23,360
The anticipated rain came

64
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:31,700
"This should clean your bruise"
you lied with a smile

65
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:39,700
Even though you're bad at argument

66
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:44,920
So stop making such lame jokes

67
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:50,050
It's so bad I teared up

68
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:57,640
Getting blue bruises all the time
I cry, cry, and cry

69
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:04,310
Leaning our unstable heart together

70
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:08,980
We fight against the rotten Bad End

71
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:10,740
I wonder why

72
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:18,870
The pleasant pain was more vivid,
even more than the happiness

73
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:23,500
Clicking our tongue over our wet clothes

74
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:26,880
We look at each other's faces and laugh

75
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:39,060
The Revenge we swore in that rainy night

76
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:47,730
I did some research on Atsushi Sendo.

77
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:51,650
This time he was married
and had children.

78
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,590
Eh? He was?

79
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:56,970
If he had a family,
then why did he do this?

80
00:07:57,850 --> 00:08:01,230
Right now, his family is missing.

81
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:02,350
Eh?

82
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:06,850
His family was likely kidnapped
and used to coerce him.

83
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:11,990
Did Sendo say anything
before just before he died?

84
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:13,490
Yeah.

85
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:15,010
The same thing as before.

86
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,700
That Toman is controlled by Kisaki.

87
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,800
Toman again?

88
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:28,090
Come to think of it,
what was Hanma doing there?

89
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:30,560
So in the end...

90
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:33,830
We couldn't change anything.

91
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:36,679
Whatever we do, it's useless.

92
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:39,510
Fate can't be changed.

93
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:47,710
You're wrong, Naoto.

94
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:53,280
Even though we did save Draken-kun,
nothing has changed.

95
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:57,260
That means it's not the reason
why Toman turned evil in the first place.

96
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,340
When Hina died in front of me.

97
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:03,850
As I watched the flames raise,
I understood something.

98
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:07,100
We have to fix things down to its root.

99
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:09,290
Its root?

100
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:11,420
I will crush Toman!

101
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:15,240
To do that, I will become
the top member of Toman in the past!

102
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,970
I thought you have some good ideas...

103
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,560
I'm serious!

104
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,930
But that's reckless.

105
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:24,430
Doesn't matter!

106
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:27,690
I'll do anything if it'll save Hina!

107
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:34,560
It's a quite ridiculous idea.

108
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:36,680
But...

109
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:39,240
Thank you.

110
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,050
Getting all depressed
just feels silly now.

111
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:47,480
-Because you're too idiotic.
-Eh?

112
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:50,920
Hey, now. Why you always
say stuff like that in the end?

113
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:56,720
But... why this happens even
after we saved Draken-kun?

114
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,970
I mean Mikey-kun and Draken-kun
is together now.

115
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:02,210
There should be no place for
Kisaki to worm his way in.

116
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:06,160
There's no way Toman get
this bad with Draken-kun around.

117
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:12,890
Checking out Ryuguji's curent
situation might worth the effort.

118
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,650
(To Naoto: -You know anything yet?
-What's going on right now?

119
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,540
-If you're alive, please say something~
-Hey....)

120
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:09,290
(Anything is fine.
If you learn something, contact me.)

121
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:39,200
(Tokyo Detention Center)

122
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:40,670
Sorry for the wait.

123
00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:44,280
I haven't heard you in a while
so I was worried.

124
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,620
Sorry.

125
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:46,850
Anyway.

126
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:49,010
What are we here for?

127
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:53,200
(Tokyo Detention Center)

128
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:56,520
Number 248.

129
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:00,830
You've got visitors.

130
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:04,720
When I did my research...

131
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,600
I discovered that Ryuguji
isn't part of Toman in the present.

132
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:11,180
That said, there is also no
record of his death.

133
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13,750
No wonder I can't find
him anywhere I look.

134
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:20,800
Right now, Ken Ryuguji...

135
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:22,740
...is on death row.

136
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:34,540
It has been a while, Takemicchi.

137
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,790
I'm glad you're okay.

138
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:41,140
Draken-kun!

139
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:49,640
Draken-kun.

140
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:51,590
Are you doing well?

141
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:53,100
Kind of.

142
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,610
Nice to meet you, I'm Naoto Tachibana.

143
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:01,640
It's thanks to this guy
I can visit you today.

144
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:06,860
I see.

145
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,990
So, what do you want?

146
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:12,040
I didn't know.

147
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:15,000
That you're on death row.

148
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:17,130
What happened?!

149
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:19,670
Why did you commit murder?

150
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:21,800
What happened to Toman?

151
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:24,850
Takemicchi.

152
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:28,010
I don't regret what I did.

153
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,390
And being here is just what I deserve.

154
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:36,850
It's my fault that Toman
became what it is now.

155
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:40,860
Because I couldn't stop him.

156
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:42,920
Him?

157
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:47,020
Toman, huh...

158
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:50,160
It was great when we were kids.

159
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:54,190
All we did was run around,
trying to make the gang bigger.

160
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:57,960
We brawled like crazy and
every day felt like a festival.

161
00:13:58,330 --> 00:14:00,920
Toman was everything to me.

162
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:05,420
Even if I redo my life,
I'd choose to live the same way.

163
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:08,050
I have no regret.

164
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,680
As I thought, Draken-kun
is still Draken-kun!

165
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,180
He hasn't changed.

166
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:16,570
But...

167
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:18,690
But?

168
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:23,730
If I can really redo my life
one more time...

169
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:26,610
There is one thing I'd do no matter what.

170
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:31,570
I'd kill Kisaki!

171
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:37,000
Tetta Kisaki?!

172
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:39,960
You mean that Kisaki?!

173
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,170
Time's up.

174
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,310
Draken-kun!

175
00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:52,220
Takemichi.

176
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:55,100
Get out of Tokyo.

177
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:56,390
Eh?

178
00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:58,350
You nearly got killed, didn't you?

179
00:14:58,350 --> 00:15:00,400
That's why you came here.

180
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:06,030
To Kisaki, killing people is no
different from squashing bugs.

181
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:07,440
Please wait!

182
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:10,570
Why?! Why would anyone
want to kill me?!

183
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:11,950
Draken-kun!

184
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:16,760
Kisaki adored Mikey.

185
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:20,410
But before we knew it,
that changed into hatred.

186
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:24,110
Kisaki...

187
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:29,510
He wants to take away
everything Mikey holds dear.

188
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,650
Kisaki...

189
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:34,560
Mikey-kun...

190
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:16,370
Draken-kun.

191
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:21,630
Good job.

192
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:25,170
Kisaki...

193
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:38,110
I can't believe Draken-kun's
on death row.

194
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:45,950
I'd kill Kisaki!

195
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:48,910
Naoto.

196
00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:52,080
Just what kind of guy is Kisaki?

197
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:55,060
Tetta Kisaki.

198
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:56,840
In the current Tokyo Manji Gang,

199
00:16:56,840 --> 00:17:00,390
he holds one of the most important
position as acting president.

200
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:05,190
He's likely the one responsible
for the repeated murder of my sister.

201
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:09,109
The police are pouring all their
effort into the investigation,

202
00:17:09,109 --> 00:17:10,940
but we can't find any lead.

203
00:17:14,069 --> 00:17:16,780
I haven't met him even once in the past.

204
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:19,510
Even if I want to go beat him,
we don't even know where he is.

205
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:23,040
Naoto.

206
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:27,410
As I thought, there's only one way.

207
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:30,330
I will become the top member of Toman!

208
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:33,210
You were serious?!

209
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:36,470
Yes! I'm really serious about this!

210
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:39,800
If I become the top member of Toman,
I can stop Kisaki.

211
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:43,300
I can also protect everyone including
Draken, Mikey, and Hina.

212
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:46,560
Our old ways was not good enough.

213
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,190
We must go to the root.

214
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:49,900
I've thought it over.

215
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:51,690
First, I'll become a captain.

216
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:56,450
Now that Pah-chin is gone,
the spot for 3rd squad captain is open.

217
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:57,900
I'll aim for that.

218
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:02,740
That's an extremely reckless idea.

219
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:05,040
But Naoto...

220
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:08,020
I don't think there is anything
else we can do.

221
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,200
I understand.

222
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:16,670
All things considered, you've somehow
succeeded in the mission thus far.

223
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:17,970
I trust you.

224
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:24,890
Seems like it will be
a long trip this time.

225
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:26,310
Yeah.

226
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:33,570
Why did I end up dumping Hina?

227
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:36,860
Why was Hanma there
when Hina was killed?

228
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:39,660
Why did Draken-kun end
up in a death row?

229
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:44,410
And who exactly is Kisaki?
How did he come to hate Mikey so much?

230
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:47,910
The mysteries scattered
like puzzle pieces.

231
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:50,710
I'll snap them together
and tear it apart!

232
00:18:56,550 --> 00:18:57,930
All white?

233
00:19:00,050 --> 00:19:01,190
Eh?

234
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,940
A bath house?

235
00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:07,930
Boo!

236
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,770
M-Mikey-kun?!

237
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:11,650
You're that surprised?

238
00:19:11,670 --> 00:19:13,660
Hey, pipe down!

239
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:16,340
Stop acting like a little kid.

240
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,590
Quit screwin' around
in the bath house.

241
00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:20,030
Draken-kun?!

242
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:22,530
I don't want to hear that from a
guy who still uses shampoo hat

243
00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:24,240
in his 3rd year of mid-school!

244
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,620
Hilarious, right?

245
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:28,620
A big guy like him is afraid of
getting shampoo in his eyes.

246
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:29,660
Shut up!

247
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,670
What's going on?!

248
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:36,670
I'm palling around in the bath house
with Mikey-kun and Draken-kun?!

249
00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:41,220
Man, I feel alive again.

250
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:44,510
Draken-kun, are your
injuries healed yet?

251
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:47,580
Huh? They were no big deal.

252
00:19:47,930 --> 00:19:49,740
'Cause I work out.

253
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:51,640
I see...

254
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:54,650
Here, look.

255
00:19:54,810 --> 00:19:57,390
My abs, and scar.

256
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:03,550
You don't look like a middle
schooler at all. Scar included.

257
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:05,000
I know, right?

258
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:14,540
You haven't completely healed yet,
so don't push yourself.

259
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:16,960
What was that for, you bastard?!

260
00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:20,300
Stop screwing around, you shit!

261
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:22,910
Whether I'm healed or not
is not the problem here!

262
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:24,890
That hurts!

263
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,310
What are you doing?!

264
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:28,600
Now you did it! Take this!

265
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:30,350
That's my two-in-one shampoo!

266
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:32,650
-Why are you trying to be fancy and stuff?!
-That's dangerous!

267
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:33,820
Stop it!

268
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,270
-Hey, that's mine!
-Fly away!

269
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:56,220
Takemicchi, you sure always got
stuff on top of your head.

270
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,400
I remember! The poop!

271
00:20:59,170 --> 00:21:01,260
Just like what we expect
from you, Takemicchi.

272
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:04,710
But you should go die for once!

273
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:11,560
How dare you! Get off me!

274
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:14,190
-You're the one who started this!
-Shut up!

275
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:16,970
It was great when we were kids.

276
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:24,250
It will be great if things
could stay like this forever.

277
00:21:24,570 --> 00:21:25,880
-Huh?!
-Huh?!

278
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:27,830
Well...

279
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:33,310
Let's get out now.

280
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:43,130
Let's go, Takemicchi.

281
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:45,530
Eh? Go where?

282
00:21:55,890 --> 00:21:57,630
'Bout time.

283
00:22:01,810 --> 00:22:03,590
Takemicchi, let's go.

284
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:08,620
To the new 3rd squad captain
nomination ceremony.

285
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,490
Eh?!

286
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:21,940
A sword is perfect for
an earnest fella like you

287
00:22:21,970 --> 00:22:25,420
You're a hero with no fire

288
00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:29,580
You are weak and powerless
in front of a gun

289
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:32,970
It's not something to take lightly

290
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:37,480
Just try it, just try it, just try it

291
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:40,150
There is no correct answer

292
00:22:40,170 --> 00:22:41,030
Mayday

293
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:44,350
Just a no no,
for a lazy lazy head

294
00:22:44,370 --> 00:22:47,990
Look, for a fast and furious
Be-bop lifestyle

295
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:51,290
Stagnate, daydream, it's bad no no NO

296
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:55,880
An obvious pray to god,
bye bye to next life

297
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:08,770
Your number of excuse is wonder

298
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:11,710
Vomiting prejudice and urge

299
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:14,830
Most emotions are soda

300
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:17,010
Say it

301
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,850
Just a no no,
for a lazy lazy head

302
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:24,530
Look, for a fast and furious
Be-bop lifestyle

303
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:29,080
Stagnate, daydream, it's bad no no NO

304
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:32,670
Goodbye bye bye to next life
