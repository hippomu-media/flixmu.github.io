1
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:08,160
Yuzuriha!

2
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:10,190
Sorry to keep you waiting.

3
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:13,950
So, what's up, Taiju-kun?

4
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:15,620
What did you want to tell me?

5
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:22,620
I was afraid that by telling her how I feel,
she wouldn't even be my friend anymore.

6
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:24,580
Hear me out, Yuzuriha.

7
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:27,080
But today's the day.

8
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:30,420
For the past five years, I've...

9
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:37,220
What's that light?

10
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:44,820
That day, everyone in the
world turned to stone.

11
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:54,780
So you're finally awake, you big oaf.

12
00:00:56,410 --> 00:01:00,740
Today is October 5th, 5738.

13
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:03,410
It's been a good 3,700 years.

14
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:07,670
How can you tell exactly what day it is?

15
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:10,570
I just counted.

16
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:12,300
How else would I know?

17
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:17,910
Humanity spent two million years getting
from the stone age to the modern age.

18
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:20,100
We're going to sprint all
the way back to the top.

19
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:23,060
I'm going to take the world back.

20
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:26,850
And I'll figure out the science behind
the petrification and our revival.

21
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:29,860
I'm going to save Yuzuriha.

22
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:39,990
I'm going to beat fantasy with science.

23
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:43,750
This is exhilarating.

24
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:47,710
So, Senku, who are we reviving first?

25
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:51,810
We're going to wake up everyone eventually.

26
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:54,260
What does it matter who we start with?

27
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:59,720
Although it would suck if we woke
up a murderer right off the bat.

28
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:03,210
I see.

29
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:09,190
I don't feel like choosing who we wake up.

30
00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:12,770
Taiju, it's your choice.

31
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:16,530
Thanks, Senku.

32
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:21,030
My answer is obvious.

33
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,170
Good morning, world

34
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:26,380
Good Morning World!

35
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:26,380
Good Morning World!

36
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:39,940
How far have I walked?

37
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:43,020
Only the pain in my feet

38
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:47,360
Gives me a sense of the distance

39
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:53,980
The hope for a beautiful view
at the end of a long night

40
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:57,200
Is what keeps me going today

41
00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:03,070
The mountains of the gods,
the palaces of green

42
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:08,090
The depths of the caves,
the ends of the deep blue sky

43
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:13,940
I'll go the full distance,
there are no limits

44
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:17,270
To the ends of the world

45
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:20,820
Good morning, world

46
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:23,900
Good Morning World!

47
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:23,900
Good Morning World!

48
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:27,990
Rid away the impossibility of the dark

49
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:33,340
An odyssey turning mythology
into the everyday

50
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:42,750
In this painstaking journey,
turning over every stone

51
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:47,670
We'll expand our world

52
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:00,810
The time has finally come.

53
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:06,670
That water's going to undo the
petrification and revive her, right?

54
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:08,680
Yeah, it should.

55
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:14,020
I tried it on a piece of a shattered statue,
and it turned back into a corpse.

56
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:16,520
You're so disrespectful!

57
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:20,540
I did try putting all the
pieces back together first,

58
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:24,320
but it looks like you can't save
someone once they're dead.

59
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,930
They made a noble sacrifice.

60
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:27,360
Send up a prayer or something.

61
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,310
Right!

62
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:30,910
Rest in peace, rest in peace...
Rest in peace, rest in peace...

63
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:38,290
Sorry I kept you waiting
for 3,700 years, Yuzuriha.

64
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:41,800
I'm going to bring you back to life now.

65
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:48,190
Wait, Senku! Yuzuriha's naked!

66
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:52,340
We can't!

67
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:54,100
We can't revive her like this!

68
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:58,150
Here we go again with
your illogical nonsense...

69
00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:00,890
We're in a stone world.
It's kind of an emergency.

70
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:04,110
No one's going to care
if your butt's showing

71
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:05,820
or if your dick's hanging out.

72
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:08,200
Yuzuriha doesn't have a dick!

73
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,200
That's not my point!

74
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:14,160
We have to take her back to camp
and put clothes on her first.

75
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,850
How heavy is that statue, anyway?

76
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:18,790
Yuzuriha isn't fat!

77
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:21,420
That's not my point.

78
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:28,070
I mean, wouldn't it be ten billion times
quicker to wake her up and have her walk?

79
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:30,550
How illogical can youâ€”

80
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:35,930
Wait, big oaf!

81
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:49,580
Why is there a lion in Japan?!

82
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:50,490
Why do you think?

83
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:53,220
It's from a zoo, obviously!

84
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:56,740
The staff must've been petrified while
the door was open or something!

85
00:05:56,740 --> 00:06:00,930
If they get out when no humans are around,
every herbivore in the zoo is on the menu.

86
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:03,320
And if they go out into the city,
it's a pet buffet!

87
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:07,090
So now they're literally the king of beasts!

88
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:13,640
In this stone world, the humans aren't
at the top of the food chain anymore!

89
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:31,910
Why aren't they attacking us, though?

90
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:38,790
They've never seen bipedals before.
We must look creepy as hell to them.

91
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:41,950
We're the only humans in the world.

92
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:44,500
They're alarmed, too.

93
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,670
But it's only a matter of time now.

94
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:50,180
Even if we get super lucky and
make it all the way back to camp,

95
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:52,520
the best we can do is
fight them with spears.

96
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:55,750
This game was practically
over before it even started!

97
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:07,860
I can't let you die, Senku!

98
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:11,270
You're humanity's last bastion,
the only one with scientific knowledge.

99
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:13,200
If it comes down to it, I'll be your shield!

100
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,030
No!

101
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:19,330
Think it over logically!

102
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:22,080
I'm the brains, and you're the brawn.

103
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:25,130
We can't lose either one!

104
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:29,380
If we're going to run,
we need to run together!

105
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:34,260
All right, got it!

106
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:40,370
You've never even hit anyone,
ever since you were little.

107
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:45,330
Your strong suit is fitness, not fighting.

108
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:50,340
Senku, if we can't outrun them,
we have one last option...

109
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:53,670
I found him earlier...

110
00:07:55,230 --> 00:08:00,070
The strongest primate
high-schooler, Shishio Tsukasa.

111
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:04,970
Sorry, Yuzuriha.

112
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:08,050
We need someone who can fight right now.

113
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:12,180
If we do defeat the lions, I promise we'llâ€”

114
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:14,200
Shut up already. Let's just pour it on him.

115
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:25,190
No! We're surrounded!

116
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:28,190
They're coming!

117
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:40,690
Sorry!

118
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:44,600
I'm sure you have no idea what's going on
after being stuck for thousands of years...

119
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:46,750
What's the situation?

120
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:52,560
Your whole body is covered in stone.

121
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,000
Lions from your nine o'clock to two o'clock.

122
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:57,130
Okay.

123
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:39,180
You can fill me in on the
details of the situation later.

124
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:47,300
But I'll promise you one thing:
you two will never be in danger again.

125
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:52,150
From now on, I'll do the fighting.

126
00:09:56,450 --> 00:09:58,130
This is great, Senku!

127
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:01,080
Humanity now has brains,
brawn, and brute force!

128
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,410
The Three Musketeers are all here!

129
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:10,750
I get that, but this Shishio
guy is way too strong.

130
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:12,920
Is that a bad thing?

131
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:15,060
Isn't it good to have
someone like him around?

132
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:19,720
What if he turns out to be an evil
bureaucrat with insatiable greed?

133
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:23,810
He's overpowered enough to beat
down a lion with his bare hands.

134
00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:28,610
In a world without guns,
he's ten billion percent unstoppable.

135
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:30,340
Eek!

136
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:33,980
Come hither, Yuzuriha.

137
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:35,540
No way!

138
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:37,420
We can't let that happen!

139
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:42,160
Sorry, but would you mind lending
me some butchering tools?

140
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:46,160
A knife, or even just stone
tools, if that's all we have.

141
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:48,980
You're gonna eat the lion?

142
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:50,290
You can eat lion?

143
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:53,440
It's not poisonous.

144
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:57,430
Although it is tough and reeks of ammonia,
not to mention it tastes horrible.

145
00:10:57,430 --> 00:10:59,780
You've had it before, Senku?!

146
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:02,550
When I went to Africa to research Ebola.

147
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:04,720
What kind of high schooler are you?!

148
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:09,790
Though it was in self-defense,
I did kill it with my own hands.

149
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,220
Yes...

150
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:17,210
I want to give thanks to the circle
of life by putting all of it to use.

151
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:19,650
That's all.

152
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:24,150
He's great!

153
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:25,830
Aren't you glad, Senku?

154
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:27,770
He's no evil bureaucrat!

155
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:30,080
He's a super good guy!

156
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:34,500
I hope so.

157
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:39,510
Well, I don't have even a millimeter
of interest in stuff like gratitude,

158
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:43,010
but I absolutely agree with not wasting meat.

159
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:03,120
The two of you built this?

160
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,280
Yeah.

161
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:08,090
Hang on for a little longer, Yuzuriha.

162
00:12:08,090 --> 00:12:10,980
We'll save you as soon as we have
enough of that miracle water...

163
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,440
the something-or-other acid.

164
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:21,630
Laboratory

165
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:20,890
Laboratory?

166
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:25,900
I'm Shishio Tsukasa.

167
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:27,720
You can call me Tsukasa.

168
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:31,420
Last names don't really mean
much in this world, do they?

169
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:35,050
I'm Senku, the sane one
who's in charge of science.

170
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:37,790
That's Taiju, the simple one
who's in charge of heavy lifting.

171
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:40,020
I'm Taiju, the simple one.

172
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:41,090
Nice to meet you.

173
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:44,320
If you need any thinking done, ask Senku.

174
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,410
What do you usually have to eat?

175
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:49,010
Mainly wild greens and mushrooms,

176
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:51,710
and the occasional rabbit for meat,
when we can catch one.

177
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:56,420
All I ever dream about lately is eating
meat until my belly's about to explode!

178
00:12:57,890 --> 00:13:01,760
Well, you won't be living like that...

179
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:04,420
any longer.

180
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:38,500
I'll be in charge of fighting and hunting.

181
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:41,800
This is awesome!

182
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:47,680
Now that I'm on your side, you'll never
have any shortage of prey again.

183
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:54,390
I see.

184
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:58,350
So if you cook it immediately, you don't
need a fridge to keep it from going bad.

185
00:13:58,350 --> 00:13:59,810
I'm not cooking it.

186
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:04,290
I'm using the aldehydes in the
smoke to kill the microbes.

187
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:09,530
To put it simply enough for you
to understand, I'm smoking it.

188
00:14:09,530 --> 00:14:14,020
If Senku and I work together,
we'll have plenty of preserved food.

189
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:18,830
Now we can finally take the
first step toward civilization.

190
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:20,910
We were still at step zero?!

191
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:26,780
Hey, Tsukasa, what's wrong?

192
00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:44,970
Sorry for startling you.

193
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:50,360
This person was buried under the rock.

194
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,740
He really is a good guy!

195
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:57,210
He's a superhero at this point, huh?

196
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:05,550
Man, I'm full.

197
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:09,470
Time for a fun quiz.

198
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:14,150
What's the most important thing we
need for a technological civilization?

199
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:16,890
Ten billion points for the correct answer.

200
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:19,950
Technological civilization?

201
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:23,610
The most important thing we need?

202
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:26,160
Smartphones!

203
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,680
Sure, smartphones!

204
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,780
Smartphones would be nice to have, huh?

205
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:33,020
How many tens of billions
of years ahead are you?!

206
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:35,550
Steel?

207
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:38,160
Steel, too, but that's later.

208
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,330
There's something more useful.

209
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:43,580
Calcium carbonate.

210
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:44,940
Of course!

211
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:46,770
As always, I'm totally clueless!

212
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:48,050
Ah, you mean lime.

213
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:49,020
Yeah.

214
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:53,020
That's putting it in terms that
a simple mind can understand.

215
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:55,380
The stuff they use to chalk athletic fields.

216
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:59,820
So we're going to be looking
for a gym storage room

217
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:01,640
to get something-or-other carbonate?!

218
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:04,600
Yeah, that's it. A gym storage room.

219
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:09,730
If only there were any still
around 3,700 years later!

220
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:19,010
You know the shells that have been so
useful for trimming your beard, big oaf?

221
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:26,050
Pulverize them into powder, and you have
that something-or-other carbonate stuff.

222
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,650
All right!

223
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:31,460
Brawn duty, here I come!

224
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:41,770
Nothing's as exhilarating
as calcium carbonate.

225
00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:46,150
There are four insanely
useful ways to use it.

226
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:48,650
First, agriculture.

227
00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:51,630
We use it to blow away all the hydrogen ions.

228
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:54,450
In other words, it upgrades the soil.

229
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:56,920
Second, construction.

230
00:16:56,920 --> 00:17:00,540
Cook it together with sand,
and you have mortar.

231
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:03,370
Mortar is basic cement.

232
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:05,620
We can build huge furnaces and houses.

233
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:08,040
Third, soap.

234
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:11,600
Gather sodium carbonate from seaweed,

235
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:14,590
mix it with oil, and the reaction creates soap.

236
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:18,420
Getting sick means game over in this world.

237
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:21,690
This little chunk that keeps germs off of us

238
00:17:21,690 --> 00:17:23,790
is our stone of life in a world with no doctors.

239
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:26,330
It's our doctor stone.

240
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:32,340
Senku, you're an amazing man.

241
00:17:33,810 --> 00:17:36,130
In the moment after I revived, too,

242
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:39,090
you communicated the situation
quickly and calmly.

243
00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:42,060
I've never seen anyone as clever as you.

244
00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:44,770
I admire you, truly.

245
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:55,180
A man who praises a man to his
face is full of ulterior motives.

246
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:57,470
It's been that way for ten billion years.

247
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:00,850
What's your point?

248
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:04,520
Oh, dear.

249
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:06,520
I really didn't mean anything by it.

250
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:13,020
I have a feeling you might be able to
build modern civilization from scratch.

251
00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:14,080
Yes.

252
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:16,780
That's all I wanted to say.

253
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:20,700
Whew!

254
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:24,790
So this is how you build civilization, huh?

255
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:28,470
Yeah, one step at a time.

256
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:32,130
We're slowly but surely
approaching modern civilization.

257
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:34,880
So, what's the fourth thing?

258
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:39,380
You said there were four
handy uses for seashells.

259
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:43,510
No, three.

260
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:45,310
Didn't I say three?

261
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:47,660
Huh? Did you?

262
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:50,060
Man, even my memory is screwy!

263
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:19,170
Shells! Shells! Shells! Shells! Shells!
Shells! Shells! Shells! Shells! Shells!

264
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:28,930
We're free in this stone world.

265
00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:33,690
Shells never belonged to anyone.

266
00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:37,400
The same goes for the sea, and the land.

267
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:45,120
There was once a poor boy who tried to make

268
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:50,450
a necklace out of seashells for his younger
sister, who was undergoing surgery.

269
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:54,630
His sister loved The Little Mermaid.

270
00:19:56,100 --> 00:20:01,380
But then, a middle-aged man who owned
the fishing rights to that spot arrived...

271
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:03,980
and with him, the stench of liquor.

272
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:11,780
The boy who was collecting
shells... or rather,

273
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:15,990
according to the man,
the boy who was stealing shells,

274
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:18,820
was beaten so badly that
his face was unrecognizable.

275
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:24,890
He was never able to help his
sister be like the Little Mermaid.

276
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:42,010
You do know what you're doing,
don't you, Tsukasa?

277
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:45,590
You just killed a man.

278
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:48,790
I know that, of course.

279
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:54,120
Senku, do you intend to bring back
everyone, including the grown-ups

280
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,850
whose hearts are tainted?

281
00:20:56,780 --> 00:21:01,250
Sure, they'll be grateful to you at first.

282
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:07,070
But as soon as civilization returns,
the rich and powerful seniors will say,

283
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:12,980
"That used to be my land."
"Pay your rent." "Pay your taxes."

284
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:17,030
They'll rob the poor youth of our future again.

285
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:22,330
We must not bring that world back.

286
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:26,300
This is a stone world.

287
00:21:26,770 --> 00:21:29,430
An untainted paradise.

288
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:33,290
We'll revive only the pure-hearted youth

289
00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:37,480
and live in a natural world owned by no one.

290
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:40,860
It's a chance to purify humanity.

291
00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:45,610
Don't you agree, Senku?

292
00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:56,160
Not at all.

293
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:58,540
Not even a millimeter.

294
00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:03,410
I'm a technology-loving
boy who gets excited over

295
00:22:03,410 --> 00:22:07,050
mechs and space and
Doraemon and stuff like that.

296
00:22:08,050 --> 00:22:13,230
I'm going to use the power of science
to rescue every single person.

297
00:22:45,050 --> 00:22:47,580
Maybe I don't know what to doã€€ã€€

298
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:50,070
Hurry up, my mind is on the moonã€€ã€€

299
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:52,890
Flying up to where the wind blew

300
00:22:53,930 --> 00:22:55,820
In my hands awakens

301
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:57,260
The passion overflowing

302
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:59,770
Just wandering through this world

303
00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:01,900
Your one shining pure

304
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:03,780
Could never be pierced
with a rusty knife

305
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:05,500
I'm burning like a fire gone wild

306
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:07,970
The moment an arrow
shot through my heart

307
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:10,590
The noise plaguing me was released

308
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:12,920
Everything was different
from that moment on

309
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,980
If I don't try, I'll never know

310
00:23:15,410 --> 00:23:20,550
Why do flowers bloom?

311
00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:24,920
Your voice echoes

312
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,050
Tell me why?

313
00:23:26,050 --> 00:23:28,140
I just shouted to the skyã€€ã€€

314
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:30,850
But you are no no no longer here,
that's right?

315
00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:35,400
The life we confirmed that day

316
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:41,190
You can call it a fleeting
dream if you want

317
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:45,950
But I'll save you from a wounded today

318
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:01,040
Next Episode

319
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:01,040
Weapons of Science
