1
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:12,300
The strongest primate
high-schooler, Shishio Tsukasa.

2
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:17,330
You two will never be in danger again.

3
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:21,270
From now on, I'll do the fighting.

4
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:26,630
This Shishio guy is way too strong.

5
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:33,880
Senku, do you intend to bring back
everyone, including the grown-ups

6
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:35,630
whose hearts are tainted?

7
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:38,380
This is a stone world.

8
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:41,530
An untainted paradise.

9
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:45,370
We'll revive only the pure-hearted youth

10
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:49,570
and live in a natural
world owned by no one.

11
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:52,940
It's a chance to purify humanity.

12
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:57,280
Don't you agree, Senku?

13
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:04,790
This guy is seriously bad news.

14
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:09,580
Then again, if we hadn't woken him up,
we would've been killed by the lions.

15
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:11,880
I guess we didn't really have a choice.

16
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:14,740
He wants to help out the youth, too,

17
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:18,720
so I'm sure he'll stay under control until
he learns the recipe for the revival fluid.

18
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,400
Even if it kills me, I have to keep quiet
about the miracle fluid in the cave.

19
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,680
Hey!

20
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,060
Good news, Senku, Tsukasa!

21
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:30,400
We have a full pot of miracle
fluid from the cave!

22
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:30,400
For Yuzuriha

23
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,110
We can finally revive Yuzuriha!

24
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:40,990
What's this "miracle fluid" you speak of?

25
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:50,100
Let's not waste time standing
here explaining it.

26
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:52,850
It'll be ten billion times
faster to just show you.

27
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:56,340
You'd better feel honored to see this.

28
00:01:56,970 --> 00:02:00,290
Time to enjoy the humanity revival show.

29
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:04,190
Good morning, world

30
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:07,400
Good Morning World!

31
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:07,400
Good Morning World!

32
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:20,960
How far have I walked?

33
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:24,040
Only the pain in my feet

34
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:28,380
Gives me a sense of the distance

35
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:35,000
The hope for a beautiful view
at the end of a long night

36
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,220
Is what keeps me going today

37
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:44,090
The mountains of the gods,
the palaces of green

38
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:49,110
The depths of the caves,
the ends of the deep blue sky

39
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:54,960
I'll go the full distance,
there are no limits

40
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:58,290
To the ends of the world

41
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,840
Good morning, world

42
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,920
Good Morning World!

43
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,920
Good Morning World!

44
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:09,010
Rid away the impossibility of the dark

45
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:14,360
An odyssey turning mythology
into the everyday

46
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:23,770
In this painstaking journey,
turning over every stone

47
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:28,690
We'll expand our world

48
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:37,020
Weapons of Science

49
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:39,670
All right, Yuzuriha.

50
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:43,030
We're finally going to save you,
for real this time!

51
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:46,910
What the hell?

52
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:50,710
This is just short of enough
revival fluid for one person.

53
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:52,870
What?! Did I take it out too soon?!

54
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:57,210
Tsukasa and I will play word games
or something while you go get more.

55
00:03:57,210 --> 00:03:59,880
So make a mad dash, big oaf.

56
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:02,230
Thanks! I'll be right back!

57
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:04,540
I'll go full speed!

58
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:12,050
In that case, I'll go, since I'm the fastest.

59
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:16,230
So would you mind telling me
where this miracle fluid is?

60
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:20,530
I should've known he'd catch on.

61
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:24,090
If he learns where the source
of the revival fluid is,

62
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:27,740
there's a ten billion percent chance
he's going to be able to stop

63
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:30,540
my Operation: Let's Save Every Last Human.

64
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,590
Did Tsukasa leave?

65
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:41,280
Yeah, in the blink of an eye.

66
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,420
He's as fast as you'd thiâ€”

67
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:47,680
Let's make the revival fluid and
bring Yuzuriha back right away,

68
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,260
while Tsukasa isn't here.

69
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:57,690
Bats...

70
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:02,190
Touching it makes my finger yellow.

71
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:06,570
So the "miracle fluid" is nitric acid.

72
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:20,930
What's going on?

73
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:23,380
Laboratory

74
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:23,380
You just said there wasn't
quite enough revival fluid!

75
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:27,150
Do you really think I'd set out
a pot that was the wrong size?

76
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:28,350
Good point!

77
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:30,850
Then why did you send Tsukasa after it?

78
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:32,890
It was double-edged bait.

79
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:35,050
I wanted to get rid of him
before reviving Yuzuriha,

80
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:37,690
even if it meant revealing
where the cave was.

81
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:40,150
Why do you want to get rid of Tsukasa?

82
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:41,610
He's a good guy!

83
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:44,440
That's why he's too much to handle.

84
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:52,080
I don't have even one millimeter of interest
in his grand vision for a "mighty world."

85
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:56,960
I find civilization-building
games more exhilarating.

86
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:00,610
All right.

87
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:02,020
You don't need to explain.

88
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:05,090
Senku, I trust what you say.

89
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:08,530
Something happened while
I was gone, didn't it?

90
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:10,590
Yeah.

91
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:14,350
Shishio Tsukasa is a good guy...

92
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:19,400
and a murderer.

93
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:25,440
Yuzuriha...

94
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,110
Sorry to keep you waiting.

95
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:29,950
I... I...

96
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:32,030
I...

97
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:35,970
I told you we're in a hurry, you big oaf!

98
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:38,250
You just dumped it all over her!

99
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:40,120
Couldn't you be a bit more, like... you know!

100
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:46,150
Wait, nothing's happening!
Is this all right?!

101
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:48,090
No, it's all right, Yuzuriha!

102
00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:50,050
But is this all right?!

103
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:53,030
It takes time for the reaction to happen.

104
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:55,260
This is a kind of cryostasis.

105
00:06:55,760 --> 00:07:00,040
It's like a protective coat made
from trace metals in the body.

106
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:02,580
Some mysterious mechanism
causes those elements

107
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:04,710
to phase-shift, maintaining a petrified state.

108
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:06,230
That's complicated!

109
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:08,010
Seriously complicated!

110
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:12,740
It's just a hypothesis, based on a
whole year of painstaking experiments.

111
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:18,580
The point is, if even one part of it
gets nital on it and breaks down...

112
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:23,080
it creates a cascade effect that
travels across the entire body.

113
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:25,920
And the petrification is undone.

114
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:31,020
Hear me out, Yuzuriha.
For the past five years...

115
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:32,720
I'm gonna tell Yuzuriha.

116
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,970
I'll survive, even if it kills me!

117
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:37,720
It's because of you that I was
able to stay alive all this time.

118
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:41,470
I'm sorry I couldn't protect you.

119
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:50,860
I've loved you... for hundreds of years...

120
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:53,950
thousands of years...

121
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:10,380
Yuzuriha, can you hear me? Yuzuriha!

122
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:14,760
Taiju-kun?

123
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:20,560
I'm sorry. I made you wait for 3,700 years...

124
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,540
I'm sorry!

125
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:27,770
I have no idea what's going on. I just woke up.

126
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:32,510
But, yeah... I think I know what's going on.

127
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:36,110
You saved me, didn't you?

128
00:08:36,810 --> 00:08:39,030
Wow... Thanks.

129
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:44,060
It wasn't me.

130
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:47,170
It was all thanks to Senku.

131
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:50,250
Senku spent a whole year
working on the revival fluid.

132
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:54,420
Sorry to barge in on your reunion chat,

133
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:57,180
but make up your mind
before Tsukasa gets back.

134
00:08:57,830 --> 00:08:59,890
We only have two options.

135
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:01,060
Choose one.

136
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:04,270
Plan A: Taiju and Yuzuriha,

137
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:08,060
you two run away right now,
and live somewhere far away.

138
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:13,030
Plan B: we fight together to
stop Tsukasa's murder spree,

139
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:15,780
using the weapons of civilization.

140
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:16,860
The answer's obvious!

141
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,510
We're going to fight by your side!

142
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:21,870
Don't underestimate us, Senku!

143
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:26,150
Yeah! I have no idea what's
going on, but I'll help, too!

144
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:28,930
I'm not trying to be nice or anything.

145
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:32,000
It just seemed logical to give
you both a chance to flee.

146
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,750
If Tsukasa really is killing people, I'llâ€”

147
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:37,530
Calling it "killing people"

148
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:40,930
is really a matter of perspective.

149
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:46,640
I'm culling them... for the
benefit of the new world.

150
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:59,280
He doesn't even try to hide his
murders from Taiju or Yuzuriha.

151
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:02,530
In other words, anyone who gets in his way...

152
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:14,760
Senku, if things go bad,
take care of Yuzuriha for me.

153
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:17,090
I'm going to stop Tsukasa!

154
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:20,220
You damn simpleton!

155
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:24,170
The guy killed a lion with his bare hands.

156
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:26,820
You're screwed, ten billion percent!

157
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:31,470
You're forcing me to use the
weapon I've been keeping secret!

158
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:39,390
I need to shoot it right
between them and stop them!

159
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:56,800
You're the first person who's managed to
remain standing after receiving my kick.

160
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:00,050
Yes... And even more interestingly,
it wasn't that you

161
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:03,610
failed to attack me just now,
but that you refused to.

162
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:04,430
Why?

163
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:06,620
I don't hit people!

164
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:09,690
You can hit me or kick me all you want,

165
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:13,060
but stop destroying the statues!

166
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:15,820
Killing people is bad!

167
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:22,380
Taiju, let me get this straight.

168
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:25,060
You'll let me keep hitting
you and never fight back,

169
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:26,950
therefore, don't destroy the statues.

170
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:29,100
Is that right?

171
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,790
That's right!

172
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:38,170
I don't understand.

173
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:40,170
There's no deal being made here.

174
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:44,100
If you insist on getting in my way...

175
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:48,180
I don't care how many times you attack me!
I won't stop trying to stop you!

176
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:50,930
That girl who was just revived...

177
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:53,440
What if I told you I'd kill her?

178
00:11:57,410 --> 00:11:58,650
I see.

179
00:11:58,650 --> 00:12:01,990
This is why Senku-kun said it might
be more logical for us to flee.

180
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:09,300
Taiju-kun!

181
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:11,020
So that did hurt him.

182
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:12,740
He's bleeding like mad.

183
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:14,750
We'll have to let him sleep for a few days.

184
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:17,670
Yes. Let's not fight among ourselves.

185
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:20,600
You protect Yuzuriha,

186
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:23,520
instead of worrying about statues
of people you don't know.

187
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:27,370
And I'll do what I need to do.

188
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:31,450
I won't let you get in my way.

189
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:40,670
The crossbow arrow was moving
at over 200 kilometers per hour.

190
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:43,030
He snatched it right out of the air...

191
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:45,450
Hey, get up!

192
00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:47,320
Come on! Come on, come on!

193
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:48,910
You said you'd let him sleep for a few days!

194
00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:48,910
Come on!

195
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:54,370
You're not gonna go down that easily
in front of Tsukasa, are you, big oaf?

196
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,250
Of course I'm not!

197
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:59,030
You're okay now?

198
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:01,090
I'm built to last.

199
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:03,400
I've got plenty of energy left to spare!

200
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,630
Thank goodness.

201
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:06,810
Right! Tsukasa!

202
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:08,890
We need to stop his murdering!

203
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,660
Hold it, big oaf.

204
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:12,220
I'm not giving up!

205
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:14,690
How simple-minded can you be?

206
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:17,340
We just learned that we can't stop him!

207
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:20,380
Still...

208
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:28,280
There's only one way to stop
a monster in this stone world.

209
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:35,090
Advance civilization and
make weapons of science.

210
00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:47,260
Such a waste...

211
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:48,930
What are you doing, Senku?

212
00:13:48,930 --> 00:13:50,860
I'm making it look like

213
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:55,020
Tsukasa freaked us out and made
us run off with just our food.

214
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:56,730
What are you talking about?

215
00:13:56,730 --> 00:13:58,020
Are we running away?

216
00:13:58,020 --> 00:14:00,070
It's just an act.

217
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:05,990
If we make weapons of science
before he takes notice, we win.

218
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:08,900
If he finds out first, we lose.

219
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:11,280
That's the kind of race this is.

220
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:16,300
We're going to go find
materials to make weapons.

221
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:17,540
Our goal is Hakone!

222
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:22,380
Hey, it's just a huge 80-kilometer
adventure, that's all.

223
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:24,380
Two full marathons, huh?

224
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,420
Five hours ought to do it.

225
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:29,050
Only for a meathead like you.

226
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:34,930
The cherry blossoms seem different.

227
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:40,190
The cherry blossoms we know,
Prunus yedoensis, aren't self-pollinating.

228
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:42,000
Which means...

229
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,380
They must have gone
extinct right off the bat.

230
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:59,660
Man, what a great view!

231
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:01,370
Perfect.

232
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:05,930
What's that, Senku?

233
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:07,260
A sextant.

234
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:11,010
It's been 35,970 seconds
since sunrise as of now.

235
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:14,430
Did you really just say that
like it's no big deal?

236
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:18,380
Senku counted for hundreds of billions
of seconds while he was petrified.

237
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:20,020
This is a piece of cake for him.

238
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:24,160
A sextant is supposed to tell you
your current location based on the time,

239
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,900
but the accuracy is such trash,
it's a complete joke.

240
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:31,900
Still, this trash is the only GPS we have.

241
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:34,110
We must be around Kamakura, I guess.

242
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:36,280
I wish I knew our exact
longitude and latitude.

243
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:40,330
Are there any buildings that
could serve as landmarks?

244
00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:42,040
Anything metal is rusted away.

245
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:44,110
There's nothing left.

246
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:47,630
What's wrong, Yuzuriha?

247
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:54,300
Isn't that...

248
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:03,650
That area's completely bare
of trees for some reason.

249
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:08,110
Kamakura's landmark is...

250
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:14,010
I know where we are.

251
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:17,580
We're at 35 degrees, 19 minutes north,

252
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:20,790
139 degrees, 32 minutes east.

253
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:34,840
Look! Look!

254
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:47,690
What's wrong, Yuzuriha?!

255
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:49,830
Who made you cry?

256
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:50,860
Was it me?!

257
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:52,900
No, I'm not crying!

258
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:56,200
I mean, it's not that I'm not crying...

259
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,780
But it's not like that, Taiju-kun.

260
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:06,750
I just woke up today,
and nothing feels real right now.

261
00:17:07,170 --> 00:17:14,200
But seeing the Great Buddha of Kamakura
made me realize we really are in Japan.

262
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:18,050
It really has been thousands of years...

263
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:24,860
I started thinking about my mom
and dad, and everyone else...

264
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:34,370
There's nothing to worry about.

265
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:38,970
We're about to beat Tsukasa
and save all of humanity.

266
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:40,870
He's right, Yuzuriha!

267
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:45,810
And the Great Buddha just told us the way!

268
00:17:45,810 --> 00:17:49,460
He's stood for thousands of years without
falling apart. He really is a god!

269
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:51,540
Wait, a Buddha?

270
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:54,730
Well, anyway, something like that!

271
00:17:56,050 --> 00:17:59,290
Well, yeah, they made the
Buddha out of bronze.

272
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:02,370
Scientifically, it just doesn't rot.

273
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:04,610
Look!

274
00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:07,750
There's absolutely no
foliage around the Buddha!

275
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:10,810
It's like he made it so
we could find him easily!

276
00:18:10,810 --> 00:18:14,070
Well, yeah, it's leaking
copper ions like crazy.

277
00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:17,530
It's just poisonous to most plants.

278
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:20,980
That's it! Bronze!

279
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:22,950
We can use it to make mirrors!

280
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:25,440
Time to upgrade my trash sextant!

281
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,270
I'll just help myself to some of this!

282
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:28,580
Stop!

283
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:30,670
You blasphemous bastard!

284
00:18:30,670 --> 00:18:32,340
It's a Great Buddha!

285
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:33,590
Shut up, simpleton! Go away!

286
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:38,760
No! The Great Buddha!

287
00:18:57,170 --> 00:18:58,780
What the hell are you doing?

288
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:01,050
I have to protect us from beasts.

289
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:03,200
Tsukasa might come after us, too.

290
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:07,890
We're screwed either way if
Tsukasa catches up to us now.

291
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:10,080
It's illogical to worry about him.

292
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:12,040
I-I see.

293
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,670
Hurry up and sleep.

294
00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:16,260
Resting is part of your job, too, big oaf.

295
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:24,100
That giant body's actually
struggling for once, huh?

296
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:25,590
I'm barely fine!

297
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:26,990
I'm just tall enough, I mean!

298
00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:29,430
I still have plenty of energy, though!

299
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:31,190
Not to worry!

300
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:35,190
Yuzuriha, your toe's still petrified.

301
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:40,200
Yeah, it does sort of get in the way,
but I guess it's okay.

302
00:19:40,530 --> 00:19:41,360
It's not okaâ€”

303
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:46,230
That's cold!

304
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:50,970
Hey, the pain's going away, too.

305
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:54,470
The revival fluid has
rejuvenating properties, too?

306
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:56,300
No, it doesn't.

307
00:19:56,300 --> 00:20:01,090
It's just that the small cracks get mended
when the petrification is reversed.

308
00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:04,220
Haven't you noticed we're still alive
even though our faces are cracked?

309
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:06,930
That's true.

310
00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:09,060
Let's head to our goal.

311
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:12,600
If you want to take a bath
in actual rejuvenating fluid.

312
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:15,190
When you say the goal in
Hakone, do you mean...

313
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:26,970
A room in disarray, hurried footsteps...

314
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:28,540
Did they run away in a panic?

315
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:34,640
Yes... That's what they're
trying to make me think.

316
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,880
How can I tell?

317
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:40,880
Senku, you aren't the kind
of man to turn tail and run.

318
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:47,470
Why did he lie about Taiju being unable to move, and then secretly head west?

319
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:50,780
It's obvious.

320
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:55,980
Senku is trying to make weapons
of science to fight against me.

321
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:57,950
But where?

322
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:03,140
We made it to the goal!

323
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:04,740
Hot springs!

324
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:06,010
Wow...

325
00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:08,280
There's a great view of Mount Fuji, too.

326
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:14,060
You two better not have forgotten
why we came all this way.

327
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,170
So what's this "weapon of science"?

328
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:20,730
The greatest invention in human history...

329
00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:21,900
Smartphones?!

330
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:23,510
You sure love your smartphone.

331
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:25,430
No.

332
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:26,910
Guns.

333
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:28,970
We're making gunpowder.

334
00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:33,930
The stone age was two million years ago.

335
00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:38,440
And gunpowder was invented
just recently, around 700 AD.

336
00:21:38,850 --> 00:21:47,030
Basically, we're about to warp
1,998,700 years ahead in civilization.

337
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:49,740
This is exhilarating.

338
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:52,380
Hakone.

339
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:55,590
If they make gunpowder,
I don't stand a chance.

340
00:21:55,590 --> 00:22:00,630
I'm going to stop them
before Senku can make it.

341
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:04,010
Thankfully, Japan is full of volcanoes.

342
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:08,470
Go to any hot spring, and you have
an all-you-can-carry bargain sale

343
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:11,320
of sulfur, the main component of gunpowder.

344
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:20,270
It's the birth of our ultimate
anti-Tsukasa weapon: black powder.

345
00:22:45,010 --> 00:22:47,540
Maybe I don't know what to doã€€ã€€

346
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:50,030
Hurry up, my mind is on the moonã€€ã€€

347
00:22:50,030 --> 00:22:52,850
Flying up to where the wind blew

348
00:22:53,890 --> 00:22:55,780
In my hands awakens

349
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:57,220
The passion overflowing

350
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:59,730
Just wandering through this world

351
00:22:59,730 --> 00:23:01,860
Your one shining pure

352
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:03,740
Could never be pierced
with a rusty knife

353
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:05,460
I'm burning like a fire gone wild

354
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:07,930
The moment an arrow
shot through my heart

355
00:23:07,930 --> 00:23:10,550
The noise plaguing me was released

356
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:12,880
Everything was different
from that moment on

357
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,940
If I don't try, I'll never know

358
00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:20,510
Why do flowers bloom?

359
00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:24,880
Your voice echoes

360
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,010
Tell me why?

361
00:23:26,010 --> 00:23:28,100
I just shouted to the skyã€€ã€€

362
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:30,810
But you are no no no longer here,
that's right?

363
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:35,360
The life we confirmed that day

364
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:41,150
You can call it a fleeting
dream if you want

365
00:23:41,150 --> 00:23:45,910
But I'll save you from a wounded today

366
00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:54,820
Fire the Smoke Signal

367
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:59,040
Fire the Smoke Signal

368
00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:01,000
Next Episode

369
