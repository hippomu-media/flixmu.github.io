1
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:13,820
If I let you live,

2
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:17,870
you would let civilization develop.

3
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:21,390
Will you promise that you won't do that?

4
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:25,170
What the hell are you talking about?

5
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:27,330
Why would I ever keep a promise likeâ€”

6
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:29,770
No, you would never lie.

7
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:31,830
Not to science.

8
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:41,100
Will you promise here and now, for all
eternity, that you'll abandon science?

9
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:51,480
If you do, I won't have
to kill you, Senku.

10
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:57,070
I can't do that.

11
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:06,330
I thought that would be your answer.

12
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:09,990
Do it in one blow.

13
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:14,650
Making me bleed out forever
wouldn't be logical for either of us.

14
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,330
Don't worry.

15
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:20,100
I'll bust your cervical
nerve in a single blow.

16
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:23,280
You'll be knocked unconscious
instantly, and then you'll die.

17
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,940
I won't make you suffer.

18
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:27,480
I promise not to miss.

19
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:30,780
Taiju-kun...

20
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:34,180
Yuzuriha...

21
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:36,110
Senku!

22
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:42,420
Senku, if we'd met 3,700 years ago...

23
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:04,530
If we'd met before this planet
became a stone world...

24
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:12,620
You may have been my first friend.

25
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:32,950
Senku!

26
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:36,180
Good morning, world

27
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:39,390
Good Morning World!

28
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,390
Good Morning World!

29
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:52,950
How far have I walked?

30
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:56,030
Only the pain in my feet

31
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,370
Gives me a sense of the distance

32
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:06,990
The hope for a beautiful view
at the end of a long night

33
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:10,210
Is what keeps me going today

34
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:16,080
The mountains of the gods,
the palaces of green

35
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:21,100
The depths of the caves,
the ends of the deep blue sky

36
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:26,950
I'll go the full distance,
there are no limits

37
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:30,280
To the ends of the world

38
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:33,830
Good morning, world

39
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:36,910
Good Morning World!

40
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:36,910
Good Morning World!

41
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:41,000
Rid away the impossibility of the dark

42
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,350
An odyssey turning mythology
into the everyday

43
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:55,760
In this painstaking journey,
turning over every stone

44
00:03:56,240 --> 00:04:00,680
We'll expand our world

45
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:17,900
Senku!

46
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:20,610
Answer me!

47
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:22,820
Answer me, please!

48
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:24,150
No!

49
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:25,240
This is wrong!

50
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,220
It can't be!

51
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:31,800
You can't die here, Senku!

52
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,830
There's no way!

53
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:36,940
He didn't suffer.

54
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:42,090
I suggest that, as his friends,
you give him a proper farewell.

55
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:57,840
So long as Yuzuriha could be used as a
hostage, Taiju would never attack me.

56
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,970
That was the power dynamic.

57
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:05,980
But, Taiju, if Senku's
death were to enrage you

58
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:08,820
and drive you to attack me mindlessly...

59
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:12,410
I'd have to kill you, too.

60
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:15,330
Please don't lose your head.

61
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:39,940
Taiju-kun!

62
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:43,690
Don't worry, Yuzuriha.

63
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:46,280
I'm calm.

64
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:51,870
It seems I have no choice
but to fight him.

65
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:55,910
Sorry, Yuzuriha. If it comes to it...

66
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:01,220
It's okay, Taiju-kun.

67
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:05,890
The three of us made a promise.

68
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:07,890
I'm sure it'll work out.

69
00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:09,390
It has to.

70
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:14,190
Yeah.

71
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:16,270
Thanks, Yuzuriha!

72
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:28,700
Why did he throw it in the air?

73
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:34,030
The boulder is a decoy.

74
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:37,310
Taiju, I can see you.

75
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:39,620
No matter what you do, you've lost.

76
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:42,630
Tsukasa is wary of me.

77
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:45,250
He wouldn't dare take his eyes off me.

78
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:49,530
But that's when I have my chance!

79
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:57,030
Tsukasa-kun's instincts would tell him
that Taiju-kun would protect me.

80
00:06:57,490 --> 00:07:01,230
I think he's right, in this stone world.

81
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:06,630
But like Senku-kun said...

82
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:13,570
Science levels the playing
field for everyone!

83
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:28,470
It's black powder.

84
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:30,760
Senku-kun left us...

85
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,130
...with science to remember him by.

86
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:38,890
The three of us made a
promise to fight together.

87
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:47,030
Yuzuriha, Senku, and I...

88
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:50,550
fight alongside each other in this battle!

89
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:57,260
Goodbye, Tsukasa!

90
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:43,700
Taiju would never attack anyone.

91
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:49,590
He wouldn't have expected me to
take so much as a scrape from that.

92
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:52,490
Goodbye, Tsukasa!

93
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:57,640
I see.

94
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:06,190
That's right, Senku. You said it yourself!

95
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:09,120
If we need to run, we're running together!

96
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,860
I don't care what anyone says.

97
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:13,550
I know you aren't dead!

98
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:19,580
You wouldn't die while you still have the
goal of restarting civilization from scratch!

99
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:29,860
What's the point of fleeing?

100
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:35,850
I shattered his cervical nerve for sure.

101
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:45,890
There's no way to revive him, especially in this stone world, with no medicine.

102
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:48,540
Heart massage...

103
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:50,970
I don't even know if I'm doing it right.

104
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:53,700
But I have to do it.

105
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:57,400
Wait, artificial respiration?

106
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:02,160
I think you should keep his neck still!

107
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:04,950
Tsukasa-kun hit him in the neck.

108
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:10,330
Senku-kun sacrificed himself for me.

109
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:16,970
Senku sacrificed himself for you?

110
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:25,930
Magic Psychology
Asagiri Gen

111
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:20,150
Here's a psychology quiz.

112
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:21,530
Suppose there's an accident,

113
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:25,930
and only you, your friend,
or your lover can be saved.

114
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:27,650
What would you do?

115
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:31,810
I think I'd get stuck trying to decide
between my friend and my lover.

116
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:33,890
Wouldn't you obviously choose yourself?

117
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:35,940
How could you ever choose?

118
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:37,780
What kind of nasty quiz is that?

119
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:39,490
I'd say everyone.

120
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:46,820
I'd look for a fundamental rule
that lets us all be saved.

121
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:51,580
Wow! Just the kind of thing a
science club president would say.

122
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:53,360
Wait, that's allowed?

123
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,020
That's my choice, too, then!

124
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:59,360
This psych quiz tells you who
is the most important to you.

125
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,630
That's ten billion percent obvious.

126
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:03,720
That book's absolute trash.

127
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:08,850
Senku would never kill himself.

128
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,410
He'd never sacrifice himself, either.

129
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:13,860
He would have bet on
some way we'd all be saved.

130
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:17,020
Try to remember about Senku.

131
00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:20,070
We're his friends. We'd know.

132
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:22,740
There must be a hint!

133
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:27,370
His neck...

134
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:37,710
I think Senku-kun was deliberately
inviting Tsukasa-kun to attack his neck.

135
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:41,970
That thing he was doing...

136
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,680
That's not a habit he's always had.

137
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:49,180
Why did he keep touching his
neck and cracking it like that?

138
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:55,270
There's a little bit of
petrification left on his neck!

139
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:03,780
When we were removing the petrification
on your foot, didn't Senku say...

140
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:08,990
that small breaks are repaired
when the petrification is undone?

141
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:12,830
Taiju-kun, the revival fluid!

142
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:13,650
Yeah!

143
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:19,780
It might work on Senku-kun's neck, too.

144
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:25,640
It might fix his neck when
the petrification is undone.

145
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:41,740
The petrification's gone!

146
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,320
Wake up!

147
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:50,330
I know you wouldn't die in a place like this!

148
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:54,130
Senku, you're...

149
00:12:55,620 --> 00:13:00,880
the star of hope for
humanity, for civilization!

150
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,030
Please!

151
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:04,520
Come back!

152
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:08,700
Wake up, Senku!

153
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:37,780
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine...

154
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:41,340
All right.

155
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:45,770
I can make it past 800,000 seconds
without nearly losing consciousness now.

156
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:49,140
My brain's getting used to this.

157
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:59,560
I've been frozen like this for
117,354,889,550 seconds now.

158
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:07,210
In other words, it's the 3,718th spring.

159
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:12,080
Starting in the spring is an absolute
must if I'm going to be revived.

160
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:17,110
All right, if I'm going to get up, now's the time.

161
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:20,830
Get up already, me.

162
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:23,090
Get up!

163
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:25,090
Get up, damn it!

164
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:26,840
Get up!

165
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:28,590
Get up!

166
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:48,740
I broke out!

167
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:53,550
I'd love to be that boisterous, but...

168
00:14:55,130 --> 00:15:00,250
I'm ten billion percent sure I would've
done that if I were a simpleton like Taiju.

169
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:03,530
My first priority is to
secure my surroundings.

170
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:09,010
My own body is a hint that's
worth its weight in gold.

171
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:14,390
The location where I was
lying down, my position...

172
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:18,890
The order in which the mystery
stone fragments fell off of me...

173
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:24,540
I'm going to keep every last piece
for when I'm ready to investigate.

174
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:31,660
Yo, where you from?

175
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:33,240
Where are you from, monkey?

176
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:42,420
Dude, he's all shiny!

177
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:43,040
Gross!

178
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,290
That monkey's got shiny skin!

179
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:48,010
He's got his nasty peepee out, too!

180
00:15:48,010 --> 00:15:49,970
So do I, actually.

181
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:52,690
Gross!

182
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:56,140
Am I the first one they've seen?

183
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:06,480
It doesn't look like civilization survived.

184
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:12,810
Which means I'm the first shiny
monkey to be born on this planet.

185
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:18,380
This is exhilarating.

186
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:32,690
It's been 117,354,893,870
seconds since I was petrified.

187
00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:36,110
The mental arithmetic is getting hard.

188
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:38,640
The leap seconds are a pain in the ass.

189
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:41,840
Not to mention, Earth is rotating

190
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:45,010
seventeen millionths of a
second slower every year.

191
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:47,650
Little numbers don't mean anything.

192
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:57,160
AD 5738
April 1

193
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:54,470
AD 5738, April 1st.

194
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:57,160
Today is Year Zero.

195
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:59,870
It all starts here.

196
00:17:10,690 --> 00:17:13,340
Take a look at the power of the shiny monkey.

197
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:19,450
I'm going to build a civilization with
enough technology to take us to space.

198
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:33,900
He's been rubbing that stick this whole time.

199
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:36,330
That shiny monkey's a dumb-dumb.

200
00:17:36,330 --> 00:17:37,690
Let's go home.

201
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:38,900
What a moron.

202
00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:49,300
I'm neither a meathead like Taiju

203
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:52,780
nor an ultra-dexterous craft
club kid like Yuzuriha.

204
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:55,210
There's no way I'm going to start a fire

205
00:17:55,210 --> 00:17:59,010
using a primitive hand drill
in Japan's humidity.

206
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:07,070
That's right.

207
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:10,400
This shiny monkey has
neither fangs nor claws.

208
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:14,230
All I can do is improvise, one step at a time.

209
00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:17,610
That's exactly what civilization is.

210
00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:31,350
Why does he keep banging the rock like that?

211
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:34,130
That shiny monkey's definitely a dumb-dumb.

212
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:43,810
There's some trick to it that I'll only
learn through trial and error.

213
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:47,060
Bash the edges off mid-air.

214
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:52,770
Sharpen both sides of the edge
by striking it on top of a surface.

215
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:56,630
I have to use the right kind
of rock for the job, too.

216
00:18:56,630 --> 00:19:00,110
This colorful rock, chert, is tough as hell.

217
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:03,860
Nothing will work better
for making a small knife.

218
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:06,720
Learn everything.

219
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,160
Try everything.

220
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:16,050
\h\h\hShiny Monkey
\h\h\hacquired
\h\h\hStone Tools!!

221
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:25,720
I can unravel this like string cheese.

222
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:33,740
Now he's twisting it.

223
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:37,440
I bet his brain is shiny, too.

224
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:43,160
\h\h\hShiny Monkey
\h\h\hacquired
\h\h\hRope!!

225
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:50,580
There are actually quite a
few animals that use tools.

226
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:56,090
Crows, otters, and orangutans, for example.

227
00:19:56,740 --> 00:20:02,090
But there's only one
species that uses science.

228
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:07,060
Generating heat by using the oxidation
of the gases given off by cellulose...

229
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:08,850
In other words...

230
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:14,400
combustion!

231
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:19,150
\h\h\hShiny Monkey
\h\h\hacquired
\h\h\hFire!!

232
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:57,480
I use ingenuity to take in everything
the universe has to offer.

233
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:03,980
I'm the master of science!

234
00:21:47,610 --> 00:21:49,990
I guess I haven't introduced myself yet.

235
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:52,690
Nice to meet you.

236
00:21:54,610 --> 00:21:56,170
What the hell is that?!

237
00:21:56,170 --> 00:21:59,380
The shiny monkey isn't shiny anymore!

238
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:05,220
I'm the only one of my kind on this planet...

239
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:07,700
a human.

240
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:10,260
Acquired Food,
Clothing and Shelter!!

241
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:14,650
I'm going to build a technological
civilization from scratch,

242
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:18,350
and this is where it starts.

243
00:22:45,010 --> 00:22:47,540
Maybe I don't know what to doã€€ã€€

244
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:50,030
Hurry up, my mind is on the moonã€€ã€€

245
00:22:50,030 --> 00:22:52,850
Flying up to where the wind blew

246
00:22:53,890 --> 00:22:55,780
In my hands awakens

247
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:57,220
The passion overflowing

248
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:59,730
Just wandering through this world

249
00:22:59,730 --> 00:23:01,860
Your one shining pure

250
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:03,740
Could never be pierced
with a rusty knife

251
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:05,460
I'm burning like a fire gone wild

252
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:07,930
The moment an arrow
shot through my heart

253
00:23:07,930 --> 00:23:10,550
The noise plaguing me was released

254
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:12,880
Everything was different
from that moment on

255
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,940
If I don't try, I'll never know

256
00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:20,510
Why do flowers bloom?

257
00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:24,880
Your voice echoes

258
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,010
Tell me why?

259
00:23:26,010 --> 00:23:28,100
I just shouted to the skyã€€ã€€

260
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:30,810
But you are no no no longer here,
that's right?

261
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:35,360
The life we confirmed that day

262
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:41,150
You can call it a fleeting
dream if you want

263
00:23:41,150 --> 00:23:45,910
But I'll save you from a wounded today

264
00:23:55,410 --> 00:23:59,000
Two Nations of the Stone World

265
00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:01,020
Next Episode

266
00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:01,020
Two Nations of the Stone World
