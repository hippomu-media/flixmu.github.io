1
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:26,580
它終於開始看起來像一個真正的人類住宅。

2
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:29,690
接著...

3
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:34,930
我不認為我可以繼續在我精疲力竭時按下忽略按鈕。

4
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:43,970
該死的！一個人獨自一人幾乎無法度過一天。

5
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:46,690
不要在意科學和進步。

6
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:51,180
要是再多一個實力強大的人就好了……

7
00:00:57,820 --> 00:00:59,890
我已經看中了這個。

8
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:02,520
就在我複活的地方，

9
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:06,340
我看到了一個被掃到這裡的人的異常陽剛之手

10
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:08,330
從和我一樣的方向。

11
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:21,600
雖然我已經看到了比我想要的更多的這張臉......

12
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,670
已經 3700 年了吧？

13
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:27,350
嘿，大笨蛋。

14
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:29,610
接著...

15
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:32,820
是時候開始使用 Senku 實驗室了。

16
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:34,510
喲，大笨蛋。

17
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:37,610
你需要什麼才能像我一樣醒來？

18
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:45,620
究竟是什麼讓 3700 年前的全人類石化了？

19
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:47,580
外星人技術攻擊假說

20
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:47,580
第一...

21
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:49,980
Dude, earthlings are so lame.

22
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:52,000
Let's turn them all into stone.

23
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,090
It did work on the swallows.

24
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:56,340
Petrification Beam!

25
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:58,850
Lawl, this is exhilarating!

26
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,760
Some Nation's Military Weapon Hypothesis

27
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:00,760
Number two...

28
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:05,060
The petrification device is finally complete!

29
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:10,400
Oh, crap! It backfired!

30
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,400
New Virus Strain Hypothesis

31
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:12,400
Number three...

32
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:16,530
We're petrification viruses!

33
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:19,370
We infect only humans and swallows!

34
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:21,610
Rofl, this is exhilarating!

35
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:26,250
The only thing that's certain

36
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:30,220
is that it targeted humans and swallows specifically.

37
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:35,920
It seems like some kind of insane fantasy, but there must be some underlying rule.

38
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,650
Which means I can fight it.

39
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:41,110
Figuring out the rules is the basis of science.

40
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:47,930
I'm standing in the face of an uncharted branch of science.

41
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:51,300
This is exhilarating.

42
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:54,470
Now, think.

43
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:57,250
How did I get out of my petrification?

44
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:59,650
Was it just simple deterioration?

45
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:05,860
如果是變質，暴露的表面不是先壞了嗎？

46
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:10,290
但石像一路都是石頭。

47
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:12,190
為我，

48
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:15,960
當我的其餘部分變回活細胞時，表面仍然是石頭。

49
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:19,300
正好相反！

50
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:22,820
表面已經退化到無法恢復為活細胞。

51
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:25,050
這就是為什麼它變成了一個石殼。

52
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:29,470
碰巧不那麼石化的表面部分恢復為細胞。

53
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:33,560
這一定是為什麼殼中缺少碎片的原因。

54
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:38,860
所以我沒有因為惡化而復活。

55
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:42,200
有一些特殊的外部因素。

56
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:46,450
離我頭最近的碎片堆在地上。

57
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:50,030
這意味著復興是從我的頭腦開始的。

58
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:58,300
裡面有東西。

59
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:10,750
這氣味...

60
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:12,890
硝酸！

61
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:17,590
我脖子後面的頭髮仍然石化。

62
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:22,030
讓我們在這根石毛上試試吧。

63
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:11,900
為什麼我只需要硝酸？

64
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:17,140
它在 Taiju 或其他人身上一毫米都不起作用。

65
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:18,470
為什麼？

66
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:20,980
我和其他人有什麼區別？

67
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:25,260
思考...

68
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:27,210
我只需要一個假設。

69
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:28,610
思考。

70
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:30,430
思考...

71
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:34,640
就是這樣！我剛在想！

72
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:39,900
3700 年來，我一直保持清醒。

73
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:43,900
大腦一天消耗 400 卡路里的熱量。

74
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:49,040
超過 3,700 年，這相當於 2 太焦耳。

75
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:51,410
所有這些能量是從哪裡來的？

76
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:55,200
E=mc²。

77
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:58,420
能量和質量有等價交換。

78
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:02,510
這是愛因斯坦老人推導出來的科學基礎。

79
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:06,800
根本沒有辦法從無到有產生能量。

80
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:12,220
為了使用我的大腦，我正在消耗石頭中的某些東西。

81
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:15,680
這意味著如果我能弄清楚那是什麼，我就可以解除石化。

82
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:18,980
嘗試一切。

83
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:21,980
去嘗試一下。

84
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:27,950
我真的很想嘗試工業蝕刻溶液nital。

85
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:29,630
該死的。

86
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:32,030
可惜我沒有酒。

87
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:33,530
實驗室

88
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:33,530
相信。

89
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:39,790
Try, try, try, try, try, try...

90
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:42,130
And try some more.

91
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:47,560
Never forget.

92
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:50,620
Petrification may be a fantasy,

93
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:56,530
but the foundations of science are absolute.

94
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:04,820
I need more manpower.

95
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:10,460
Take the nitric acid and wake up already, you blockhead!

96
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:13,430
You're awake, aren't you?

97
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:15,580
You've been awake for the past 3,700 years!

98
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:18,230
You're no different from me.

99
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:20,620
You don't know when to give up!

100
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:26,500
Senku! I...

101
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:29,170
Taiju...

102
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:32,580
I'll believe in you and wait for as long as it takes.

103
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:34,870
I'm hopeless without you!

104
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:37,850
Come back, Taiju!

105
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:40,980
Come back, Senku!

106
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:23,600
It stopped raining.

107
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:29,440
The thunderstorm that was keeping us camouflaged is gone.

108
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,850
Don't raise your voices.

109
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:34,530
If Tsukasa hears us, we'll be instantly screwed.

110
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:36,350
You're right!

111
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:38,410
He's not coming, is he?

112
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:52,280
I'm impressed you noticed my neck.

113
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:55,260
I hardly gave you a speck of a hint.

114
00:08:55,260 --> 00:09:00,820
Taiju, Yuzuriha, you both get ten billion points.

115
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,170
Good morning, world

116
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:08,380
早安世界！

117
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:08,380
早安世界！

118
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:21,940
我走了多遠？

119
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:25,020
只有腳痛

120
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:29,360
給我一種距離感

121
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:35,980
希望在漫漫長夜的盡頭看到美麗的景色

122
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:39,200
是什麼讓我今天堅持下去

123
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:45,070
眾神之山，綠之宮殿

124
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:50,090
洞窟深處，碧空盡頭

125
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:55,940
我會走完全程，沒有限制

126
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:59,270
到世界盡頭

127
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:02,820
早安，世界

128
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:05,900
早安世界！

129
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:05,900
早安世界！

130
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:09,990
擺脫黑暗的不可能

131
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:15,340
將神話變成日常生活的奧德賽

132
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:24,750
在這艱辛的旅程中，翻過每一塊石頭

133
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:29,670
我們將擴大我們的世界

134
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:38,070
石頭世界的兩個國家

135
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:43,330
它的...

136
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:44,610
... 經過 ...

137
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:52,650
別介意我的頸神經，你剛剛壓碎了我的整個身體！

138
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:53,420
我會殺了你！

139
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:05,290
我相信你知道不這樣做，但不要去感謝我的每一件小事。

140
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:06,680
我也不會謝謝你。

141
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:13,310
歡迎回來，千空君。

142
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:22,260
Don't you think the shape on this hide kind of looks like a rocket?

143
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:24,000
There are star-looking things, too!

144
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,080
They don't look anything like it.

145
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:29,080
It looks like a science flag. I bet it'll look good on Senku-kun.

146
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:31,450
Let's put it on his neck, just in case.

147
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:32,650
Oh, yeah!

148
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:35,150
It'll be even better with a splint. See?

149
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:37,840
Uh, I really don't need this.

150
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:40,200
I'm all better now.

151
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:44,090
Professor Senku's self-sacrificing human experiment was a success.

152
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:48,930
The restorative effects of undoing petrification are too damn high.

153
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:55,480
The petrification that's given us so much grief is what cured you, too, huh?

154
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:58,110
You said it when we made soap, too...

155
00:11:58,110 --> 00:12:02,900
But maybe this petrification is the stone of life that replaces doctors for us.

156
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:05,270
It's Doctor Stone!

157
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:18,000
Come to think of it, it's weird.

158
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:22,630
When the petrification is undone, it repairs everything around it, too.

159
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:26,090
What a considerate scientific phenomenon.

160
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:30,180
I've been thinking this whole time...

161
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:33,290
Who petrified humanity?

162
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:35,470
Who attacked us?

163
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:36,690
No...

164
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:41,050
Was it really even an attack?

165
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:49,120
If it can fix Senku-kun's neck,

166
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,190
maybe if we piece together

167
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:55,750
the shattered statues and pour revival fluid on them, it'll put people back together.

168
00:12:56,130 --> 00:12:57,980
I tried that right at the beginning.

169
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:00,750
They just went back to being a shattered corpse.

170
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:03,940
Why wouldn't it work if it's so regenerative?

171
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:09,210
Yuzuriha...

172
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:13,890
Taiju's ten billion percent too crude for this.

173
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:17,770
You're our ultra-skillful crafts club member.

174
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:21,580
It'll be a grueling mission.

175
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:22,860
Can you do it?

176
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:37,990
That really is really grueling.

177
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:39,380
But I'll do it!

178
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:41,910
That was quick.

179
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:43,930
Craft is all about perseverance!

180
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:46,020
Are you sharing secrets?

181
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:48,130
No fair! Let me in on it!

182
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:54,430
I, um... was saying maybe we should go see Tsukasa-kun.

183
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:56,020
Oh, yeah?

184
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:57,770
Tsukasa's place, huh?

185
00:13:58,690 --> 00:13:59,930
What?!

186
00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:01,140
Why?!

187
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:03,700
He's the dangerous man that killed Senku!

188
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:08,040
I mean, he's not dead, and he was a good guy, but...

189
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:11,540
At the very least, he thought he'd killed Senku!

190
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:15,160
That's exactly what we accomplished in that fight.

191
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:21,080
Tsukasa thinks I'm in the afterlife now.

192
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:25,420
Meanwhile, I can always know where Tsukasa is.

193
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:27,720
We'll have a giant advantage in this battle,

194
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:33,670
if you two can infiltrate the Tsukasa Empire as spies.

195
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:39,450
I gave Yuzuriha the details about the mission.

196
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:42,460
Taiju, you protect Yuzuriha.

197
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:45,980
Blockheads like you are better off not knowing everything.

198
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:47,950
All right, I got it.

199
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:48,980
I'll do it.

200
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:53,130
Tsukasa intends to use the miracle water,

201
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:59,750
revival fluid, to amass an army of young people to make a new world ruled by military might.

202
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:02,770
In order to defeat the Tsukasa Empire

203
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:05,960
and stop the mass destruction that is the purification of humanity...

204
00:15:07,090 --> 00:15:11,470
我們必須建立一支革命軍隊，可以利用科學與他們作戰。

205
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:14,680
但是你自己怎麼做呢？

206
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,070
是的。

207
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:21,180
如果杉菜有神奇的水，硝酸，你就不能製造火藥，

208
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:23,360
而且你不能增加你的人力。

209
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:28,650
答案是顯而易見的。

210
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:32,810
我要找到發射煙霧信號的神秘人

211
00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:35,250
讓他們站在我這邊。

212
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:41,650
問題是他們可能會先遇到Tsukasa。

213
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:45,670
我只能打賭他們沒有的機會。

214
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:50,630
所以，往後，我們二人將成為司庭帝國的間諜。

215
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,890
您將為科學革命軍隊尋找盟友。

216
00:15:55,690 --> 00:15:57,730
我們每個人都會打自己的仗。

217
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:02,840
這就是想法。

218
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:06,460
想到我們悲傷的告別，我都淚流滿面。

219
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:12,110
你們倆都太隨意了。

220
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:15,220
伙計們真的很堅忍，對吧？

221
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:16,320
是的。

222
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,830
Senku 總是合乎邏輯的。

223
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:22,030
我們有一段時間不會見面了。

224
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:27,210
不是幾週，幾個月，甚至……

225
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:46,150
陰影！

226
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:46,810
我保證——”

227
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:50,280
等等，我不能提高我的聲音。

228
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:13,840
在我離開的那一小會兒。

229
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:17,930
嘿，你已經等了 3700 年了。

230
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:23,420
再多幾個月或幾年沒什麼大不了的。

231
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:29,430
我們要建立我們的科學王國。

232
00:17:48,130 --> 00:17:50,540
右後，57 米。

233
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:55,260
是的，你，就是過去兩分鐘一直默默關注我的人。

234
00:17:56,890 --> 00:17:58,260
你是誰？

235
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:10,430
藍眼睛。

236
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:12,010
她年輕。

237
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:15,390
太巨等人剛剛把她復活了？

238
00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:19,410
或者還有其他方法可以讓人們復活嗎？

239
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:35,540
現在，這不好。

240
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:38,020
你不應該先說“很高興認識你”嗎？

241
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:39,530
閉上你的嘴！

242
00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:41,550
保存您對地獄的介紹。

243
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:58,000
不可能的。

244
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,920
她還太年輕，沒有這種能力。

245
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:03,660
武術界不可能沒有聽說過她。

246
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:04,820
她是誰？

247
00:19:05,530 --> 00:19:06,870
我看到了一切！

248
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:08,870
你劫持了一個女人，

249
00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:13,880
然後你無情地殺死了那個為她挨打的紳士。

250
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:16,250
我聽不見你在說什麼，

251
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:18,260
但我對你的背景不感興趣。

252
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:25,310
向巫師紳士懺悔，直到你的靈魂腐爛！

253
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:30,940
巫師？

254
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:35,060
你剛剛沐浴在它裡面，你已經忘記了嗎？

255
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:38,780
你用可疑的黑火藥在召喚山之怒火！

256
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:41,030
山之怒火？

257
00:19:42,170 --> 00:19:43,550
火山爆發？

258
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:52,170
因此，您可能不是複活者中的一員，而是他們的孩子之一。

259
00:19:53,530 --> 00:19:54,710
或者...

260
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:57,550
你是哪一代？

261
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:03,720
她是一個沒有科學的純潔原始人。

262
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:05,970
我可以輕鬆地統治他們。

263
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:08,470
我可以輕鬆殺死他們。

264
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:10,820
沒有理由攻擊他們。

265
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:16,460
因此，我的直接目標是返回洞穴。

266
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:20,940
Taiju 和 Yuzuriha 已經看到瞭如何製作火藥。

267
00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:23,950
我需要在他們之前取得奇蹟之水。

268
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:28,490
這是再見。

269
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:07,620
You're... the sorcerer gentleman who protected that woman.

270
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,280
You're alive!

271
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:11,250
Stop talking.

272
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:14,210
You can introduce yourself all you want later.

273
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:16,190
Don't waste your energy.

274
00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:19,540
Can you hold out until evening?

275
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:23,060
If you're at your limit,

276
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:26,260
I'll take a gamble and blow it up with the little gunpowder I have left.

277
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:27,710
But if you can hold on,

278
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:31,500
it'll take forever, but I'll save you, ten billion percent.

279
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:35,560
You're the only one who can make the decision!

280
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,410
Decide right now!

281
00:21:37,410 --> 00:21:38,310
Which is it?

282
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:43,690
Yeah, my organs and bones are all fine.

283
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:45,110
I can hold on.

284
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:02,320
I'd say the fallen tree weighs roughly one ton.

285
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:05,130
To get it to one side would take half of that, 500 kilograms.

286
00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:08,220
Assuming my own weight is just over 60 kilograms,

287
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:10,760
multiplied by 2 to the 3rd power to get to 500 kilograms...

288
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:13,140
I can just barely make it with three.

289
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:14,630
Maybe I don't know what to doã€€ã€€

290
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:17,120
Hurry up, my mind is on the moonã€€ã€€

291
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:19,300
The bamboo's barely strong enough.

292
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,940
Flying up to where the wind blew

293
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:21,830
I'll just have to pack them with dirt.

294
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:22,870
In my hands awakens

295
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:24,310
The passion overflowing

296
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:26,820
Just wandering through this world

297
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:29,170
Who would have thought that soap would be so useful now?

298
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:28,950
Your one shining pure

299
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:30,830
Could never be pierced with a rusty knife

300
00:22:29,170 --> 00:22:34,620
It's an all-star team of Great Professor Senku's inventions.

301
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:32,550
I'm burning like a fire gone wild

302
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:35,020
The moment an arrow shot through my heart

303
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:37,640
The noise plaguing me was released

304
00:22:37,370 --> 00:22:39,250
What is this?

305
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:39,970
Everything was different from that moment on

306
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,130
This is science.

307
00:22:39,970 --> 00:22:42,030
If I don't try, I'll never know

308
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:46,460
It was invented by Old Man Archimedes a few hundred years BC.

309
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:47,600
Why do flowers bloom?

310
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:51,470
It converts the measly strength of a high school kid into Herculean might.

311
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:51,970
Your voice echoes

312
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:52,430
It's called a pulley!

313
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:53,100
Tell me why?

314
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:55,190
I just shouted to the skyã€€ã€€

315
00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:57,900
But you are no no no longer here, that's right?

316
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:02,450
The life we confirmed that day

317
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:08,240
You can call it a fleeting dream if you want

318
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:13,120
But I'll save you from a wounded today

319
00:23:20,850 --> 00:23:22,310
Amazing.

320
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:27,410
No, I'm not talking about that Archi-whoever's wisdom.

321
00:23:28,130 --> 00:23:33,880
I'm talking about your unwavering diligence in forcing yourself through every step

322
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:36,140
until you solve a problem.

323
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:41,220
My name is Kohaku.

324
00:23:41,870 --> 00:23:47,010
It seems I've taken quite a liking to you.

325
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:59,040
Two Nations of the Stone World

326
