1
00:00:10,219 --> 00:00:11,345
Get up.

2
00:00:12,554 --> 00:00:14,097
Hurry and get up.

3
00:00:14,973 --> 00:00:17,643
Get up. Hey!

4
00:00:18,352 --> 00:00:20,103
You brat! Hey!

5
00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:22,314
How much longer
are you going to sleep?

6
00:00:22,314 --> 00:00:23,857
Hurry and get up!

7
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:27,694
What the heck?

8
00:00:27,903 --> 00:00:30,113
I heard that a Demon Slayer Corps
member travels with a demon.

9
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:32,366
I thought he would be
someone impressive and ruthless.

10
00:00:33,325 --> 00:00:35,202
Why is it just an ordinary guy?

11
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:38,872
All right.

12
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:41,500
We must hold the trial
for this young man now.

13
00:00:41,917 --> 00:00:42,918
I see.

14
00:00:46,255 --> 00:00:47,881
He has been traveling
with his sister...

15
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:49,508
who has turned into a demon.

16
00:00:50,634 --> 00:00:52,386
What a moving display
of sibling love!

17
00:00:52,594 --> 00:00:54,012
What a strong child.

18
00:00:55,222 --> 00:00:57,015
Who is that?

19
00:00:57,307 --> 00:00:59,476
You're not allowed
to speak here, you fool.

20
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:01,228
Who do you think
are in front of you?

21
00:01:01,854 --> 00:01:03,230
You're in front of Hashira.

22
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:08,652
Hashira?

23
00:01:08,986 --> 00:01:10,404
What's a Hashira?

24
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:12,781
What's going on?

25
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:16,159
Who exactly are these people?

26
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:23,750
Where am I?

27
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,173
This is the headquarters
of the Demon Slayer Corps.

28
00:01:29,965 --> 00:01:32,968
You're going to be put on trial,

29
00:01:33,844 --> 00:01:35,679
Kamado Tanjiro.

30
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:54,573
(Demon Slayer)

31
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:13,944
(Episode 22:
The Master of the Mansion)

32
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:20,158
Before the trial starts,

33
00:03:20,409 --> 00:03:22,536
let me tell you your crime first.

34
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:24,121
I don't think a trial is required!

35
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:28,166
(Flame Hashira, Rengoku Kyojuro)

36
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:29,418
Protecting a demon...

37
00:03:29,418 --> 00:03:31,170
is obviously against the rules
of the Demon Slayer Corps.

38
00:03:31,253 --> 00:03:33,255
We can take care of him.

39
00:03:33,839 --> 00:03:35,591
We'll execute him
together with the demon.

40
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:38,135
(Sound Hashira, Uzui Tengen)

41
00:03:38,135 --> 00:03:41,013
I'll cut off
his head majestically...

42
00:03:41,305 --> 00:03:42,848
and let fresh blood
splatter all over.

43
00:03:42,848 --> 00:03:44,308
I'm the best at that.

44
00:03:44,808 --> 00:03:46,643
I'll make it
as majestic as possible.

45
00:03:47,811 --> 00:03:49,104
(Love Hashira, Kanroji Mitsuri)

46
00:03:49,146 --> 00:03:50,439
No way.

47
00:03:50,689 --> 00:03:53,609
You want to kill such a cute child?

48
00:03:53,901 --> 00:03:55,444
My heart aches a lot.

49
00:03:55,444 --> 00:03:56,778
I feel so bad.

50
00:03:57,779 --> 00:03:59,114
(Stone Hashira, Himejima Gyomei)

51
00:03:59,114 --> 00:04:02,701
What a poor child.

52
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,620
He's really pitiful.

53
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:08,081
Being born itself is a tragedy.

54
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,210
(Mist Hashira, Tokito Muichiro)

55
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:13,629
How should I describe
the shape of that cloud?

56
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:16,423
What is it called?

57
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:18,926
Where's Nezuko?

58
00:04:19,551 --> 00:04:20,636
Nezuko.

59
00:04:21,929 --> 00:04:23,013
Hey.

60
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:26,350
The Hashira members are talking.
Where are you looking?

61
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:28,602
These Hashira members...

62
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:30,521
are the most
highly regarded swordmasters...

63
00:04:30,521 --> 00:04:32,481
in the Demon Slayer Corps.

64
00:04:34,024 --> 00:04:35,400
Hashira.

65
00:04:37,152 --> 00:04:38,362
Kill him.

66
00:04:39,321 --> 00:04:41,240
Yes, majestically kill him.

67
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:43,867
Hey!

68
00:04:44,076 --> 00:04:45,160
Nezuko.

69
00:04:45,494 --> 00:04:47,120
Nezuko, where are you?

70
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:49,039
Nezuko.

71
00:04:49,164 --> 00:04:50,332
Zenitsu.

72
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:52,125
Inosuke.

73
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:53,418
Mr. Murata!

74
00:04:54,253 --> 00:04:57,589
By the way,
what should we do about Tomioka?

75
00:05:03,595 --> 00:05:07,808
He's not even tied up.
My head hurts from looking at him.

76
00:05:08,559 --> 00:05:10,269
According to Kocho,

77
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,855
Tomioka violated the rules too.

78
00:05:12,938 --> 00:05:14,481
(Serpent Hashira, Iguro Obanai)

79
00:05:14,523 --> 00:05:15,941
How should we punish him?

80
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:17,860
How should he take responsibility?

81
00:05:17,943 --> 00:05:19,987
How should we let him suffer?

82
00:05:23,198 --> 00:05:26,034
Speak, Tomioka.

83
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,374
It's all my fault
for dragging Mr. Tomioka down.

84
00:05:34,126 --> 00:05:36,003
Mr. Iguro is still the same.

85
00:05:36,003 --> 00:05:37,671
He is as stubborn as a snake.

86
00:05:37,921 --> 00:05:39,631
He is so stubborn. So cool!

87
00:05:46,513 --> 00:05:47,764
Mr. Tomioka.

88
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:50,142
You're standing so far away
all alone.

89
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:51,518
You're so cute!

90
00:05:53,145 --> 00:05:54,188
(Water Hashira, Tomioka Giyu)

91
00:05:54,188 --> 00:05:55,856
Gosh, it's all right.

92
00:05:56,023 --> 00:05:58,233
He's here anyway.

93
00:05:59,193 --> 00:06:01,320
Let's consider the punishment later.

94
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:04,698
(Insect Hashira, Kocho Shinobu)

95
00:06:05,282 --> 00:06:09,244
Most importantly, I have something
I want to ask the boy.

96
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:12,539
Hey, as a member
of the Demon Slayer Corps,

97
00:06:12,581 --> 00:06:15,000
you're traveling with a demon
for your tasks.

98
00:06:15,501 --> 00:06:16,877
Regarding this matter,

99
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,046
I want to hear an explanation
from you.

100
00:06:19,296 --> 00:06:20,631
Of course,

101
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:23,133
the act itself has already violated
the rules of the Demon Slayer Corps.

102
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:26,929
You should know that, right?

103
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:33,101
Kamado Tanjiro.

104
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:36,021
As a member
of the Demon Slayer Corps,

105
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:37,814
why are you traveling with a demon?

106
00:06:39,775 --> 00:06:41,109
There's no need
to hear his explanation at all.

107
00:06:42,945 --> 00:06:44,780
Take your time. It's fine.

108
00:06:44,947 --> 00:06:46,114
Please tell me the reason.

109
00:06:50,702 --> 00:06:51,703
My...

110
00:06:51,995 --> 00:06:53,163
My sister...

111
00:07:02,965 --> 00:07:05,259
It would be better
if you have some water.

112
00:07:09,805 --> 00:07:11,765
Since your jaw is injured,

113
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:13,350
please drink slowly.

114
00:07:14,685 --> 00:07:15,853
I added a painkiller in the water.

115
00:07:15,853 --> 00:07:17,521
It can make you feel better.

116
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:27,197
But it won't heal your wounds,

117
00:07:27,197 --> 00:07:28,740
so you can't
force yourself too much.

118
00:07:30,367 --> 00:07:32,953
So Kamado Tanjiro...

119
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,001
The demon is my sister.

120
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:42,337
When I was out,
my family was attacked by a demon.

121
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:44,548
When I got home, they were all dead.

122
00:07:45,424 --> 00:07:47,301
Even though my sister
turned into a demon,

123
00:07:47,593 --> 00:07:49,219
she never ate any humans.

124
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:52,139
She has never eaten humans
and she never will.

125
00:07:53,432 --> 00:07:56,185
She will never harm anyone!

126
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:59,771
Stop saying these ridiculous things
in front of me.

127
00:08:00,147 --> 00:08:03,066
You would side with her
since she's your family.

128
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:05,319
We can't believe
anything you say at all.

129
00:08:05,611 --> 00:08:07,446
I won't believe you.

130
00:08:08,197 --> 00:08:11,867
He is possessed by demons.

131
00:08:12,576 --> 00:08:16,455
Kill that poor child now
so that he can be free.

132
00:08:17,414 --> 00:08:18,749
Please listen to me.

133
00:08:19,124 --> 00:08:20,918
I became a demon slayer...

134
00:08:20,918 --> 00:08:22,377
because I want to heal Nezuko.

135
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,338
It has already been
more than two years...

136
00:08:24,338 --> 00:08:26,173
since Nezuko turned into a demon.

137
00:08:26,465 --> 00:08:28,967
Nezuko never ate any humans
during this period!

138
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:32,888
You're just talking
in circles, you fool.

139
00:08:33,555 --> 00:08:34,890
She has never eaten any humans.

140
00:08:35,098 --> 00:08:36,558
She will never eat humans.

141
00:08:37,226 --> 00:08:38,310
You're all talk and no action.

142
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:40,187
Show me majestic proof.

143
00:08:45,484 --> 00:08:47,277
What is the name of that bird?

144
00:08:48,946 --> 00:08:50,155
Well...

145
00:08:50,364 --> 00:08:51,573
Excuse me.

146
00:08:52,366 --> 00:08:54,493
I have a question.

147
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:59,248
I don't think that Lord Oyakata
is unaware of this.

148
00:09:02,543 --> 00:09:05,420
Can we really handle it
by ourselves?

149
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:13,136
I think it's better if we wait
until Lord Oyakata arrives.

150
00:09:13,136 --> 00:09:14,179
My sister.

151
00:09:14,471 --> 00:09:16,890
My sister battles with me!

152
00:09:17,516 --> 00:09:18,767
She battles...

153
00:09:18,934 --> 00:09:20,936
to protect humans as a member
of the Demon Slayer Corps!

154
00:09:21,478 --> 00:09:22,521
So...

155
00:09:23,438 --> 00:09:24,523
Well...

156
00:09:24,606 --> 00:09:27,109
Things have become interesting.

157
00:09:30,195 --> 00:09:33,240
Is he the stupid member
who travels with a demon?

158
00:09:38,954 --> 00:09:41,915
What is your motive exactly
for doing so?

159
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:43,125
(Wind Hashira, Shinazugawa Sanemi)

160
00:09:44,126 --> 00:09:45,544
Mr. Shinazugawa.

161
00:09:45,711 --> 00:09:46,795
He has gained more scars
on his body.

162
00:09:46,837 --> 00:09:47,921
He's so handsome!

163
00:09:48,505 --> 00:09:50,507
This troubles me, Mr. Shinazugawa.

164
00:09:50,841 --> 00:09:53,343
Please put the box down.

165
00:09:57,973 --> 00:09:59,766
It seems like Shinobu is mad.

166
00:09:59,892 --> 00:10:01,143
That's so rare.

167
00:10:01,393 --> 00:10:02,686
It's so cool.

168
00:10:03,812 --> 00:10:05,147
Mr. Shinazugawa.

169
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:07,191
Please don't be rash.

170
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:10,110
Kid, what did you say
the demon does?

171
00:10:11,445 --> 00:10:13,697
She battles to protect humans...

172
00:10:13,697 --> 00:10:14,948
as a member
of the Demon Slayer Corps?

173
00:10:15,574 --> 00:10:17,159
That is something...

174
00:10:18,577 --> 00:10:20,954
definitely impossible, fool!

175
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:31,089
You hurt my sister!

176
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:34,134
I won't forgive you even if you're
a Hashira or whatever you are!

177
00:10:39,056 --> 00:10:41,266
Is that so? That's great.

178
00:10:43,018 --> 00:10:44,019
Stop.

179
00:10:44,394 --> 00:10:46,438
Lord Oyakata will arrive soon.

180
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:06,917
I'm sorry.

181
00:11:11,463 --> 00:11:12,673
Hey.

182
00:11:13,882 --> 00:11:16,635
Even if Tomioka interfered,

183
00:11:16,802 --> 00:11:19,346
that kid still managed
to knock down Shinazugawa.

184
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:24,142
Since you're unable to distinguish
between good and bad demons,

185
00:11:24,393 --> 00:11:26,478
I think you should stop
being a Hashira!

186
00:11:27,646 --> 00:11:29,439
Hey.

187
00:11:32,234 --> 00:11:33,986
I'm going to kill you.

188
00:11:37,865 --> 00:11:40,534
- Lord Oyakata is here.
- Lord Oyakata is here.

189
00:11:53,088 --> 00:11:54,715
You are all here.

190
00:11:58,635 --> 00:12:01,138
My lovely swordsmen.

191
00:12:11,273 --> 00:12:13,859
- Lord Oyakata is here.
- Lord Oyakata is here.

192
00:12:48,602 --> 00:12:49,978
Good morning.

193
00:12:50,729 --> 00:12:52,814
The weather is so nice today.

194
00:12:54,733 --> 00:12:56,527
The sky is very blue, right?

195
00:12:57,319 --> 00:12:59,071
The familiar faces are all here.

196
00:12:59,321 --> 00:13:01,406
I'm delighted that you're able...

197
00:13:01,406 --> 00:13:02,658
to attend the Hashira meeting...

198
00:13:02,658 --> 00:13:04,076
that is held every six months.

199
00:13:05,744 --> 00:13:06,870
Was he wounded?

200
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,705
No, is he sick?

201
00:13:09,623 --> 00:13:11,542
Is he Lord Oyakata?

202
00:13:14,628 --> 00:13:15,712
He moves so fast.

203
00:13:15,921 --> 00:13:17,673
I couldn't react at all.

204
00:13:18,257 --> 00:13:19,383
Darn it.

205
00:13:31,353 --> 00:13:33,188
Lord Oyakata,
you're safe and healthy.

206
00:13:33,272 --> 00:13:34,731
This is great.

207
00:13:35,774 --> 00:13:37,234
I sincerely wish you well.

208
00:13:37,234 --> 00:13:39,236
I hope that everything goes smoothly
for you in the future.

209
00:13:40,654 --> 00:13:42,489
Thank you, Sanemi.

210
00:13:44,616 --> 00:13:46,743
I'm the one who wants to say...

211
00:13:46,743 --> 00:13:49,162
such wishes to Lord Oyakata.

212
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:52,457
Forgive me for being frank.

213
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:54,459
Before the Hashira meeting starts,

214
00:13:54,501 --> 00:13:58,213
can you please shed some light
regarding Kamado Tanjiro...

215
00:13:58,338 --> 00:14:01,550
who's traveling with a demon
and becoming a demon slayer?

216
00:14:03,302 --> 00:14:06,054
He's obviously lacking
intellect and rationality,

217
00:14:06,096 --> 00:14:08,265
yet he's logical when he speaks.

218
00:14:09,892 --> 00:14:10,976
You're right.

219
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:13,812
I'm sorry to startle you all.

220
00:14:14,897 --> 00:14:16,773
I approved the matter...

221
00:14:16,857 --> 00:14:18,775
regarding Tanjiro and Nezuko.

222
00:14:20,903 --> 00:14:24,198
I hope that everyone
can accept them as well.

223
00:14:30,454 --> 00:14:33,040
Even if it's your request,
Lord Oyakata,

224
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,375
it's still hard for me
to understand and obey.

225
00:14:36,877 --> 00:14:38,795
I also majestically object to it.

226
00:14:39,254 --> 00:14:42,382
I can't accept a demon slayer
who travels with a demon.

227
00:14:43,175 --> 00:14:46,929
I'll obey Lord Oyakata's request.

228
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:49,556
Actually, I'm fine with it.

229
00:14:50,766 --> 00:14:52,434
I'll forget about it
immediately anyway.

230
00:14:59,733 --> 00:15:02,486
I can't trust him.

231
00:15:02,653 --> 00:15:05,113
And I really hate demons.

232
00:15:06,198 --> 00:15:08,617
Even though I respect Lord Oyakata
from the bottom of my heart,

233
00:15:08,617 --> 00:15:10,244
I really can't understand your view.

234
00:15:10,869 --> 00:15:12,371
I vehemently object to it.

235
00:15:13,205 --> 00:15:15,958
The duty of Demon Slayer Corps
members is to kill demons.

236
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:19,127
Please gravely punish Tomioka
and the rule violator.

237
00:15:24,383 --> 00:15:25,509
Bring the letter.

238
00:15:26,134 --> 00:15:27,177
Yes.

239
00:15:33,517 --> 00:15:36,770
This letter is from
a former Hashira,

240
00:15:36,979 --> 00:15:39,731
Mr. Urokodaki Sakonji.

241
00:15:40,691 --> 00:15:42,609
I'll read a part of it.

242
00:15:44,653 --> 00:15:48,115
"Please allow Tanjiro to perform
his task with his sister..."

243
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,825
"who has turned into a demon."

244
00:15:51,034 --> 00:15:53,537
"Nezuko has
a very strong willpower."

245
00:15:53,871 --> 00:15:56,123
"She still maintains the rationality
of a human being."

246
00:15:57,374 --> 00:15:59,793
Even if she's hungry,
she would never eat humans.

247
00:16:00,043 --> 00:16:03,672
She has remained this way
for over two years.

248
00:16:04,089 --> 00:16:06,633
Even though it's a situation
that's hard to accept right away,

249
00:16:06,717 --> 00:16:08,510
it's the truth.

250
00:16:09,136 --> 00:16:12,514
If Nezuko attacks humans,

251
00:16:12,723 --> 00:16:14,766
Kamado Tanjiro,

252
00:16:14,892 --> 00:16:16,476
"Urokodaki Sakonji,"

253
00:16:16,643 --> 00:16:18,020
"and Tomioka Giyu..."

254
00:16:18,437 --> 00:16:20,480
"will perform ritual suicide
to take responsibility for it."

255
00:16:37,831 --> 00:16:40,751
So what if they're willing
to perform ritual suicide?

256
00:16:42,085 --> 00:16:44,713
Go and die if they want to.

257
00:16:45,672 --> 00:16:48,091
That's not a guarantee at all.

258
00:16:48,509 --> 00:16:50,219
Shinazugawa is right.

259
00:16:50,719 --> 00:16:53,138
It would be too late to kill her
after she eats a human!

260
00:16:53,347 --> 00:16:54,973
The victims can't come back to life!

261
00:16:57,142 --> 00:16:58,727
Indeed, you're right.

262
00:16:59,811 --> 00:17:01,688
So, Lord Oyakata.

263
00:17:03,482 --> 00:17:06,235
We can't guarantee
that she won't attack humans...

264
00:17:06,443 --> 00:17:08,195
and we can't prove it either.

265
00:17:10,364 --> 00:17:11,573
However...

266
00:17:12,783 --> 00:17:16,328
in the same way, we can't prove
that she will attack humans either.

267
00:17:19,206 --> 00:17:21,542
It has been over two years
and Nezuko hasn't eaten any humans.

268
00:17:21,792 --> 00:17:24,211
That's a fact.

269
00:17:24,711 --> 00:17:25,796
For Nezuko's sake,

270
00:17:25,796 --> 00:17:28,090
three people are vouching for her
with their lives.

271
00:17:28,632 --> 00:17:30,509
If we want to deny these facts,

272
00:17:30,717 --> 00:17:34,471
the opposing party must also provide
a more convincing argument.

273
00:17:37,891 --> 00:17:40,185
Are you planning to do that?

274
00:17:43,522 --> 00:17:44,523
Aside from this,

275
00:17:44,731 --> 00:17:47,609
there's something that I must tell
my swordsmen.

276
00:17:49,444 --> 00:17:52,489
Tanjiro once met Kibutsuji.

277
00:17:53,949 --> 00:17:55,325
How could that happen?

278
00:17:55,492 --> 00:17:58,453
Even Hashira members have never
encountered Kibutsuji before.

279
00:17:59,705 --> 00:18:00,831
Him?

280
00:18:01,373 --> 00:18:03,417
What does Kibutsuji look like?
Is he powerful?

281
00:18:03,834 --> 00:18:05,002
Where were you?

282
00:18:05,752 --> 00:18:06,920
Did you battle?

283
00:18:07,796 --> 00:18:09,506
What did Kibutsuji do?

284
00:18:09,631 --> 00:18:11,175
Did you find his lair?

285
00:18:11,341 --> 00:18:12,426
Answer us!

286
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:15,179
Shut up.
I was the one who asked him first.

287
00:18:15,387 --> 00:18:17,347
Tell me about
Kibutsuji's ability first.

288
00:18:27,024 --> 00:18:28,317
Kibutsuji...

289
00:18:28,609 --> 00:18:31,528
sent his men to kill Tanjiro.

290
00:18:32,362 --> 00:18:35,532
Perhaps he just wants
to silence him,

291
00:18:35,991 --> 00:18:38,368
but it was my first time
seeing Kibutsuji reveal himself.

292
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:40,412
I really don't want
to let him fade away.

293
00:18:41,872 --> 00:18:44,333
I'm afraid that
what happened to Nezuko...

294
00:18:44,374 --> 00:18:47,294
is something that
even Kibutsuji didn't expect.

295
00:18:51,048 --> 00:18:52,883
Do you understand now?

296
00:18:56,803 --> 00:18:58,805
I don't understand, Lord Oyakata.

297
00:18:59,431 --> 00:19:01,433
If she's human,
it's fine to let her live.

298
00:19:01,433 --> 00:19:02,518
But she's a demon,
so we can't do that.

299
00:19:03,101 --> 00:19:04,686
When I think about the mindset...

300
00:19:04,686 --> 00:19:06,313
of Demon Slayer Corps members
in fighting demons...

301
00:19:06,313 --> 00:19:08,649
and how much we've sacrificed,

302
00:19:09,525 --> 00:19:11,068
I really can't accept it.

303
00:19:21,161 --> 00:19:23,038
What is he doing?

304
00:19:23,413 --> 00:19:25,290
His blood has soiled the garden.

305
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:27,751
Lord Oyakata.

306
00:19:27,918 --> 00:19:29,878
Let me prove to you...

307
00:19:30,212 --> 00:19:32,422
how ugly demons are.

308
00:19:33,215 --> 00:19:34,383
Sanemi.

309
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:39,221
Hey, demon.

310
00:19:39,513 --> 00:19:41,056
It's time to eat.

311
00:19:41,431 --> 00:19:42,683
Come and eat me.

312
00:19:57,531 --> 00:19:59,283
You don't need to force yourself
to hold back.

313
00:19:59,533 --> 00:20:01,660
Just show your true self.

314
00:20:01,869 --> 00:20:04,204
I'll kill you with one strike
of the sword.

315
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:06,081
Nezuko!

316
00:20:06,748 --> 00:20:07,958
Shinazugawa.

317
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:09,501
You can't do it under the sun.

318
00:20:10,586 --> 00:20:11,837
If you don't go to a dark place,

319
00:20:11,879 --> 00:20:13,297
the demon won't come out.

320
00:20:14,756 --> 00:20:16,049
Lord Oyakata.

321
00:20:16,258 --> 00:20:18,802
Please forgive me for being rude.

322
00:20:27,936 --> 00:20:29,980
Stop it!

323
00:20:32,357 --> 00:20:34,484
Demon, come out now.

324
00:20:35,402 --> 00:20:38,155
I have your favorite
fresh human blood here.

325
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:39,990
I can't breathe.

326
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:41,742
I can't move at all.

327
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:16,068
Nezuko.

328
00:21:17,861 --> 00:21:20,614
(Destroy)

329
00:23:00,005 --> 00:23:01,089
(Preview)

330
00:23:02,424 --> 00:23:05,886
I can't believe that Shinazugawa
was headbutted by a rookie.

331
00:23:05,886 --> 00:23:07,679
That was actually a great headbutt.

332
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:09,681
Yes, it produced a majestic sound.

333
00:23:09,765 --> 00:23:11,141
It should hurt a lot, right?

334
00:23:11,225 --> 00:23:12,643
Namo Amitābha.

335
00:23:12,684 --> 00:23:15,729
But that kid dared
to diss a Hashira member.

336
00:23:15,812 --> 00:23:17,314
I can't believe that you're
just saying whatever you want.

337
00:23:17,314 --> 00:23:18,524
If Tomioka didn't interfere,

338
00:23:18,524 --> 00:23:19,983
I would have been able
to dodge that headbutt.

339
00:23:20,108 --> 00:23:21,360
That sounds like an excuse.

340
00:23:22,194 --> 00:23:24,112
It seems like everyone
hasn't changed at all.

341
00:23:24,321 --> 00:23:26,323
Now, let me tell you
a Taisho secret!

342
00:23:26,573 --> 00:23:29,910
When we greet Lord Oyakata,
the one who greets him first wins.

343
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:32,162
So before Lord Oyakata arrives,

344
00:23:32,162 --> 00:23:33,580
everyone is actually very tense.

345
00:23:34,373 --> 00:23:37,376
Next, Episode 23, "Hashira Meeting".

346
00:23:37,709 --> 00:23:39,878
