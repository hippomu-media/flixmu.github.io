1
00:00:00,417 --> 00:00:01,585
That mask...

2
00:00:01,585 --> 00:00:03,462
is the mark.

3
00:00:03,462 --> 00:00:04,963
It's precisely because
they were wearing those masks...

4
00:00:04,963 --> 00:00:06,673
that they were eaten by me.

5
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:26,026
Total Concentration Breathing!

6
00:00:26,318 --> 00:00:27,736
Water Breathing!

7
00:00:32,366 --> 00:00:33,659
First Form!

8
00:00:41,667 --> 00:00:43,043
Water Surface Slash!

9
00:00:57,099 --> 00:01:01,812
(Demon Slayer)

10
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:20,974
(Episode 5: My Own Steel)

11
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,850
Urokodaki.

12
00:03:55,527 --> 00:03:58,614
Darn it...

13
00:03:59,615 --> 00:04:02,743
My body is starting to disintegrate.

14
00:04:03,118 --> 00:04:04,870
I can't stop it.

15
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,046
Darn it.

16
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:18,842
The last thing I see is
the face of a demon slayer.

17
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:27,351
Why did this happen?

18
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:33,857
I'm so scared.

19
00:04:33,857 --> 00:04:35,943
I'm scared of being alone at night.

20
00:04:38,153 --> 00:04:40,531
Where are you, Brother?

21
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:45,285
Please hold my hands.

22
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:47,037
Like how you always do.

23
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:49,665
Why?

24
00:04:50,082 --> 00:04:54,211
Why did I kill my brother?

25
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:57,381
That's odd.

26
00:04:58,423 --> 00:04:59,675
Who is...

27
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,176
Brother?

28
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:10,227
The smell of sadness.

29
00:05:23,282 --> 00:05:25,909
God, I beg you.

30
00:05:32,082 --> 00:05:34,543
When this person is reborn,

31
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:38,630
I hope you won't let him
become a demon again.

32
00:05:40,924 --> 00:05:42,092
Brother!

33
00:05:42,718 --> 00:05:44,761
Brother!

34
00:05:44,928 --> 00:05:46,847
Can you hold my hand?

35
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:50,225
What can I do with you?

36
00:05:50,559 --> 00:05:52,644
You're always so timid.

37
00:06:16,168 --> 00:06:17,169
Sabito.

38
00:06:17,169 --> 00:06:18,170
Makomo.

39
00:06:19,171 --> 00:06:22,257
And other children who were killed.

40
00:06:23,509 --> 00:06:24,635
I won.

41
00:06:25,427 --> 00:06:27,179
You can rest in peace now.

42
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:40,067
You can fulfill your wishes
to go back now.

43
00:06:40,692 --> 00:06:42,528
Although only your souls remain,

44
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:44,071
go back to Sagiri Mountain.

45
00:06:51,161 --> 00:06:53,330
Go back to your beloved
Master Urokodaki.

46
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,713
When I die,

47
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:04,049
my soul will return there too.

48
00:07:19,565 --> 00:07:21,149
I have something to ask you.

49
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:24,027
What should I do to turn demons...

50
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:25,529
back into humans again?

51
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:38,917
Tell me...

52
00:07:39,501 --> 00:07:40,544
the way to turn Nezuko...

53
00:07:42,212 --> 00:07:43,881
back into a human again!

54
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:23,045
Wisteria flowers.

55
00:08:26,381 --> 00:08:27,674
I survived.

56
00:08:44,066 --> 00:08:45,484
Only four people left.

57
00:08:46,109 --> 00:08:47,861
There were about 20 people
at the beginning.

58
00:08:49,196 --> 00:08:50,572
That person didn't make it.

59
00:08:52,741 --> 00:08:55,994
It's all because I passed out.

60
00:08:57,412 --> 00:08:58,872
I didn't manage to save his life.

61
00:09:00,374 --> 00:09:02,751
I'm going to die.

62
00:09:03,669 --> 00:09:05,087
Even if I survive now,

63
00:09:05,128 --> 00:09:06,713
I'll die at the end.

64
00:09:07,923 --> 00:09:09,758
- Welcome back.
- Welcome back.

65
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:17,224
Congratulations.

66
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,893
Thank goodness you're all safe.

67
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:24,398
What am I supposed to do next?

68
00:09:25,274 --> 00:09:26,316
Where's the sword?

69
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:30,487
First of all, we are going
to distribute your uniforms.

70
00:09:31,321 --> 00:09:33,282
Your measurements will be taken...

71
00:09:33,657 --> 00:09:37,035
and your ranks will be engraved.

72
00:09:37,828 --> 00:09:40,956
There is a total of 10 ranks.

73
00:09:41,373 --> 00:09:42,416
Kinoe.

74
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:43,500
Kinoto.

75
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,501
Hinoe.

76
00:09:44,501 --> 00:09:45,544
Hinoto.

77
00:09:45,544 --> 00:09:46,545
Tsuchinoe.

78
00:09:46,712 --> 00:09:47,880
Tsuchinoto.

79
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:48,922
Kanoe.

80
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:49,965
Kanoto.

81
00:09:49,965 --> 00:09:51,049
Mizunoe.

82
00:09:51,216 --> 00:09:52,467
Mizunoto.

83
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:54,678
Currently, all of you are...

84
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:57,931
at the lowest rank, Mizunoto.

85
00:09:58,724 --> 00:10:00,100
Where's the sword?

86
00:10:00,601 --> 00:10:03,645
For the steel to be used
to make your sword,

87
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:06,148
you need to choose an ore today.

88
00:10:06,481 --> 00:10:08,317
We will need around 10 to 15 days...

89
00:10:08,483 --> 00:10:10,611
to make your swords.

90
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:12,112
What?

91
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:13,322
Before that...

92
00:10:22,164 --> 00:10:23,999
A Kasugai Crow...

93
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:27,002
will be your companion from now on.

94
00:10:28,003 --> 00:10:30,464
Kasugai Crow?

95
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:35,761
Kasugai Crows are mainly used
for our communication.

96
00:10:36,512 --> 00:10:37,763
Crow?

97
00:10:38,347 --> 00:10:39,848
Isn't this a sparrow?

98
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:41,600
Is this a joke?

99
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:49,942
I don't care about the stupid crow.

100
00:10:55,322 --> 00:10:57,741
Where's the sword?

101
00:10:57,866 --> 00:11:00,118
Give me my sword now.

102
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,204
The Demon Slayer Corps sword.

103
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:04,373
The color-changing sword!

104
00:11:08,669 --> 00:11:10,420
Let go of this child.

105
00:11:10,629 --> 00:11:12,631
I'll break your arm
if you don't let her go.

106
00:11:14,508 --> 00:11:16,218
Who are you?

107
00:11:17,469 --> 00:11:18,929
What should I do?

108
00:11:19,221 --> 00:11:21,014
Do it if you dare.

109
00:11:41,076 --> 00:11:43,328
Are you done talking?

110
00:11:50,752 --> 00:11:55,424
Please come forward
and pick your ore.

111
00:11:57,509 --> 00:11:59,469
These are ores
that can kill demons...

112
00:11:59,511 --> 00:12:02,639
and protect yourselves.

113
00:12:02,723 --> 00:12:04,808
Please choose one.

114
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:08,353
I'd probably die right away.

115
00:12:14,776 --> 00:12:16,612
Even if I were to choose,

116
00:12:17,321 --> 00:12:19,031
I wouldn't know which one to choose.

117
00:12:20,616 --> 00:12:23,076
This is my first time seeing an ore.

118
00:12:23,535 --> 00:12:26,079
There's no way to judge
based on its appearance.

119
00:12:28,415 --> 00:12:30,334
I have no idea which is better.

120
00:12:50,562 --> 00:12:51,730
I see.

121
00:12:55,442 --> 00:12:57,361
There are five survivors.

122
00:12:58,403 --> 00:12:59,821
That's exceptional.

123
00:13:02,074 --> 00:13:04,952
My children have grown
in numbers again.

124
00:13:05,827 --> 00:13:07,955
I wonder what kind of swordsmen
they will become.

125
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:33,355
I was too naive.

126
00:13:34,815 --> 00:13:38,318
Regardless of whether
the demons could communicate or not,

127
00:13:39,528 --> 00:13:41,989
their only focus is to kill me.

128
00:13:42,865 --> 00:13:45,492
I'm sorry, Nezuko.

129
00:13:47,661 --> 00:13:49,746
I couldn't find the way...

130
00:13:51,874 --> 00:13:53,584
to turn demons back into humans.

131
00:13:59,548 --> 00:14:01,466
Even the uniform feels heavy.

132
00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:04,511
I want to go back sooner.

133
00:14:05,304 --> 00:14:06,889
But my entire body hurts.

134
00:14:35,667 --> 00:14:36,919
I'm finally here.

135
00:14:37,669 --> 00:14:38,837
Nezuko.

136
00:14:39,046 --> 00:14:40,339
Master Urokodaki.

137
00:14:51,683 --> 00:14:52,893
Nezuko!

138
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:55,979
You're awake!

139
00:14:59,066 --> 00:15:00,359
Nezuko!

140
00:15:01,902 --> 00:15:03,278
It hurts.

141
00:15:13,872 --> 00:15:17,417
Why did you fall asleep so suddenly?

142
00:15:18,168 --> 00:15:20,420
You didn't wake up after that.

143
00:15:22,548 --> 00:15:25,050
I thought you were dead!

144
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:33,433
Thank goodness.

145
00:15:33,892 --> 00:15:35,352
You came back alive.

146
00:15:48,156 --> 00:15:49,241
I see.

147
00:15:49,491 --> 00:15:51,743
You killed the mutated demon.

148
00:15:52,327 --> 00:15:53,370
Yes.

149
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:56,915
Finally...

150
00:15:59,168 --> 00:16:01,503
Thank goodness you came back alive.

151
00:16:01,795 --> 00:16:02,880
Yes.

152
00:16:05,215 --> 00:16:08,552
There are many types of demons.

153
00:16:09,344 --> 00:16:10,929
Demons who use Blood Demon Arts,

154
00:16:11,013 --> 00:16:13,056
a type of special spell,

155
00:16:13,056 --> 00:16:14,600
are known as mutated demons.

156
00:16:16,685 --> 00:16:20,606
You'll probably be fighting
those kinds of demons in the future.

157
00:16:21,231 --> 00:16:23,483
Fighting against those demons...

158
00:16:23,525 --> 00:16:26,320
will be much harder compared
to what you've been through so far.

159
00:16:27,404 --> 00:16:28,906
However, Tanjiro...

160
00:16:29,364 --> 00:16:31,950
you'll definitely be fine.

161
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:34,578
Yes.

162
00:16:36,872 --> 00:16:37,998
Well...

163
00:16:38,123 --> 00:16:41,293
I think Nezuko is different
from other demons.

164
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:45,214
Is she using the spell you said?

165
00:16:45,422 --> 00:16:48,175
No, I don't think so.

166
00:16:48,509 --> 00:16:51,845
I don't think she's the type
that uses Blood Demon Arts.

167
00:16:52,971 --> 00:16:55,224
This is just my guess.

168
00:16:55,474 --> 00:17:00,062
Nezuko uses sleep
to substitute for eating humans.

169
00:17:00,187 --> 00:17:03,106
Maybe she's using this method
to regain her physical strength.

170
00:17:07,444 --> 00:17:10,280
I'll protect Nezuko.

171
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:23,168
(Fifteen days later)

172
00:17:38,934 --> 00:17:40,227
You are?

173
00:17:40,269 --> 00:17:42,646
I'm Haganezuka.

174
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:45,899
Kamado Tanjiro's sword is ready.

175
00:17:45,941 --> 00:17:47,276
I'm here to deliver it.

176
00:17:50,404 --> 00:17:53,323
I'm Kamado Tanjiro.

177
00:17:54,157 --> 00:17:55,158
Please come in.

178
00:17:55,158 --> 00:17:56,869
This is the Nichirin Blade.

179
00:17:57,578 --> 00:17:59,371
It's made by me.

180
00:17:59,413 --> 00:18:00,455
Well...

181
00:18:00,747 --> 00:18:02,666
I'll make tea. Please come in.

182
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:04,209
The materials of a Nichirin Blade...

183
00:18:04,418 --> 00:18:07,212
are collected from
the mountain closest to the sun.

184
00:18:08,172 --> 00:18:09,840
Scarlet Crimson Iron Sand...

185
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:11,800
and Scarlet Crimson Ore.

186
00:18:12,301 --> 00:18:13,302
Therefore,

187
00:18:13,343 --> 00:18:16,305
the blade can absorb sunlight.

188
00:18:16,847 --> 00:18:18,265
I see.

189
00:18:18,765 --> 00:18:19,933
Because Sunlight Mountain...

190
00:18:19,933 --> 00:18:22,060
is perpetually bathed
in sunlight throughout the year.

191
00:18:23,562 --> 00:18:25,772
- There are no clouds or rain.
- He's still the same.

192
00:18:25,772 --> 00:18:28,442
- You'll get dirty, please stand up.
- He never listens.

193
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,820
Hyottoko mask?

194
00:18:35,532 --> 00:18:38,243
Aren't you the son of Kakushaku?

195
00:18:38,577 --> 00:18:40,954
This is a sign of good fortune.

196
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:42,331
No.

197
00:18:42,331 --> 00:18:44,958
I'm the son of Tanjuro and Kie.

198
00:18:45,417 --> 00:18:47,085
That's not what I meant.

199
00:18:47,503 --> 00:18:51,632
You have red hair and red eyes.

200
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:55,260
A family in the fire business
gave birth to a child like you.

201
00:18:55,302 --> 00:18:58,347
This is a sign of good fortune
and it's worth celebrating.

202
00:18:58,722 --> 00:18:59,848
Is that so?

203
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:01,391
I'm not too sure.

204
00:19:01,975 --> 00:19:05,020
Your sword might turn bright red.

205
00:19:05,437 --> 00:19:07,231
Am I right, Urokodaki?

206
00:19:07,731 --> 00:19:08,774
Yes.

207
00:19:13,737 --> 00:19:15,864
All right, let's take a look
at the sword.

208
00:19:15,989 --> 00:19:20,702
The Nichirin Blade is also known as
the color-changing sword.

209
00:19:21,078 --> 00:19:24,206
It will change its color depending
on the sword owner.

210
00:19:51,608 --> 00:19:52,651
Black!

211
00:19:52,693 --> 00:19:54,027
It's black?

212
00:19:55,153 --> 00:19:57,364
Is there something wrong
with a black sword?

213
00:19:58,156 --> 00:19:59,616
Is it ominous?

214
00:19:59,658 --> 00:20:02,786
No, there's no such thing.

215
00:20:02,828 --> 00:20:05,956
It's just that it is uncommon
to see such a pitch-black sword.

216
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:11,461
I thought I could see
a bright red sword.

217
00:20:11,587 --> 00:20:13,046
I'm so angry!

218
00:20:15,132 --> 00:20:16,550
It hurts!

219
00:20:16,592 --> 00:20:17,676
This is dangerous.

220
00:20:17,676 --> 00:20:19,469
Please calm down.

221
00:20:19,469 --> 00:20:20,929
How old are you this year?

222
00:20:20,929 --> 00:20:22,806
I'm 37 years old.

223
00:20:30,898 --> 00:20:32,983
Kamado Tanjiro.

224
00:20:32,983 --> 00:20:34,943
Please accept your mission.

225
00:20:35,986 --> 00:20:37,696
It talks?

226
00:20:37,988 --> 00:20:40,949
Go to the northwestern town quickly.

227
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:45,370
Young girls have been vanishing
without a trace.

228
00:21:02,304 --> 00:21:04,306
Every single night,

229
00:21:04,348 --> 00:21:06,642
there are instances
where young girls vanish.

230
00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:10,812
Find the demons lurking there...

231
00:21:10,812 --> 00:21:12,439
and take them down immediately.

232
00:21:12,814 --> 00:21:14,441
Kamado Tanjiro,

233
00:21:14,483 --> 00:21:16,568
be very cautious.

234
00:21:17,361 --> 00:21:19,196
This is your first mission...

235
00:21:19,363 --> 00:21:21,949
as a demon slayer.

236
00:21:23,116 --> 00:21:25,661
First mission?

237
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:00,964
(Demon Slayer)

238
00:23:03,467 --> 00:23:05,969
Kasugai Crow, say hello to everyone.

239
00:23:06,136 --> 00:23:09,056
You're not qualified
to order me around.

240
00:23:09,348 --> 00:23:11,725
- It hurts!
- You silly brat.

241
00:23:14,645 --> 00:23:15,687
Seriously.

242
00:23:16,438 --> 00:23:19,358
Now, let me tell you
a Taisho secret!

243
00:23:19,733 --> 00:23:21,944
Shut up and do your mission now!

244
00:23:21,944 --> 00:23:23,612
Move it!

245
00:23:24,154 --> 00:23:26,448
Fine, I understand.

246
00:23:27,824 --> 00:23:30,869
Next, Episode 6,
"Swordsman Accompanying a Demon".

247
00:23:30,869 --> 00:23:31,954
Listen up!

248
00:23:31,954 --> 00:23:33,330
If you don't watch
the premier next week,

249
00:23:33,372 --> 00:23:34,915
I'll peck off your heads.

250
00:23:35,958 --> 00:23:39,837
(To be continued)
