1
00:00:08,884 --> 00:00:10,093
Have you changed into your uniform?

2
00:00:10,677 --> 00:00:11,678
Yes.

3
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:50,467
(Demon Slayer)

4
00:02:07,252 --> 00:02:10,005
(Episode 6: Swordsman
Accompanying a Demon)

5
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:12,466
Tanjiro.

6
00:02:13,342 --> 00:02:16,929
Before you start doing missions
for the Demon Slayer Corps,

7
00:02:16,929 --> 00:02:19,306
there are a few things
I want to be clear about.

8
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:20,974
All right.

9
00:02:21,517 --> 00:02:25,354
The Demon Slayer Corps uniform
you're wearing right now...

10
00:02:25,437 --> 00:02:28,398
is made with
a special kind of fiber.

11
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:30,192
It's very lightweight...

12
00:02:30,192 --> 00:02:32,194
and it doesn't get damp
or burned easily.

13
00:02:32,611 --> 00:02:34,696
The claws and teeth
of an average demon...

14
00:02:34,738 --> 00:02:37,407
cannot damage this uniform.

15
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:39,826
It's that durable?

16
00:02:40,369 --> 00:02:41,662
Also,

17
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:44,456
that Nichirin Blade you have...

18
00:02:44,665 --> 00:02:46,917
changes color
according to its owner.

19
00:02:46,917 --> 00:02:49,628
Each color has
its own special properties.

20
00:02:50,546 --> 00:02:51,588
However,

21
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:53,423
because the black blade is so rare,

22
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:56,468
I don't know many details
about its properties.

23
00:02:57,761 --> 00:02:59,638
Since no one knows much about it...

24
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:01,223
Since no one knows much about it...

25
00:03:01,223 --> 00:03:03,433
Is there a problem,
Master Urokodaki?

26
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:05,853
Since no one knows much about it,

27
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:07,938
it is said that swordsmen
who use black blades...

28
00:03:07,938 --> 00:03:10,274
never have the chance
to get very far.

29
00:03:11,692 --> 00:03:15,112
I don't know what I can accomplish
in the Demon Slayer Corps,

30
00:03:16,238 --> 00:03:17,698
but I must turn Nezuko...

31
00:03:17,823 --> 00:03:19,408
back into a human.

32
00:03:21,368 --> 00:03:22,536
You're right.

33
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:25,330
I believe you can do it.

34
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:26,915
Yes.

35
00:03:27,499 --> 00:03:30,252
There's also this.

36
00:03:31,086 --> 00:03:34,548
It's a box you can use to carry
your sister during the day.

37
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,383
It's made of Mist Cloud Fir,

38
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:38,677
which is very light.

39
00:03:39,303 --> 00:03:42,681
It's coated with
rock varnish to make it harder,

40
00:03:42,723 --> 00:03:44,474
so it's also a lot more durable.

41
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:46,727
Thank you.

42
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:49,521
It's so light!

43
00:03:49,521 --> 00:03:51,398
It really is light,
Master Urokodaki!

44
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,323
Nezuko.

45
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:00,991
Go inside.

46
00:04:01,617 --> 00:04:02,743
Can you do it?

47
00:04:19,176 --> 00:04:20,177
Nezuko.

48
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:22,721
From now on,
we'll be together forever.

49
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,852
All right, we'll set off now.

50
00:04:30,896 --> 00:04:32,314
Wait a second.

51
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:05,597
Nezuko, are you still doing okay?

52
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,105
Nezuko?

53
00:05:14,565 --> 00:05:16,483
This is just my guess.

54
00:05:16,775 --> 00:05:19,945
Nezuko uses sleep
to substitute for eating humans.

55
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:24,283
Maybe she's using this method
to regain her physical strength.

56
00:05:31,081 --> 00:05:32,082
Nezuko.

57
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,585
Have a good rest.

58
00:05:52,186 --> 00:05:53,812
The northwestern town...

59
00:05:54,146 --> 00:05:55,397
should be here, right?

60
00:06:20,631 --> 00:06:22,883
Look at Mr. Kazumi.

61
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:25,677
Poor guy. He looks haggard.

62
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:34,645
That's because Satoko was captured
right from his side.

63
00:06:43,028 --> 00:06:45,864
It makes me feel so uneasy
every night.

64
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:48,242
It's awful.

65
00:06:48,659 --> 00:06:51,662
Once night falls, another young girl
will be taken away.

66
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:57,167
Mr. Kazumi!

67
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:07,594
May I ask you something?

68
00:07:13,475 --> 00:07:15,602
This is where Satoko vanished.

69
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:19,273
You may not believe what I'm saying.

70
00:07:20,691 --> 00:07:21,900
I do.

71
00:07:22,693 --> 00:07:23,902
I believe you.

72
00:07:25,863 --> 00:07:26,989
I believe you!

73
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:39,793
Though there's still remnant
of the demon's scent,

74
00:07:41,295 --> 00:07:42,671
it's very faint.

75
00:07:46,592 --> 00:07:47,926
Something doesn't feel right.

76
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:52,139
Who is this kid?

77
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:02,399
What is this nonsense?

78
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:05,777
She disappeared?

79
00:08:06,403 --> 00:08:07,654
You jerk!

80
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:10,324
Dear, please stop!

81
00:09:00,374 --> 00:09:01,750
Please believe me!

82
00:09:04,169 --> 00:09:05,879
Satoko really just vanished
into thin air!

83
00:09:06,922 --> 00:09:08,006
I believe you.

84
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:11,343
This is the reason I came here.

85
00:09:17,975 --> 00:09:19,643
Are you going to continue?

86
00:09:20,269 --> 00:09:21,270
Yes.

87
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:23,522
It's already so late though.

88
00:09:24,147 --> 00:09:27,067
I'm really glad you're
so concerned about me,

89
00:09:27,401 --> 00:09:29,069
but let's continue tomorrow.

90
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:30,612
You should get some rest.

91
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:35,242
Those guys only come out at night,

92
00:09:35,868 --> 00:09:38,370
so I can't rest.

93
00:09:39,538 --> 00:09:42,291
I discovered a new scent
nearby here.

94
00:09:43,292 --> 00:09:45,502
Those guys must be around here.

95
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:47,713
Those guys?

96
00:09:48,672 --> 00:09:49,882
Could you...

97
00:09:50,382 --> 00:09:51,758
really be...

98
00:09:59,558 --> 00:10:01,226
It's too terrifying.

99
00:10:01,727 --> 00:10:04,897
Avoid going out these days.

100
00:10:05,272 --> 00:10:06,648
Yes, Mom.

101
00:10:07,191 --> 00:10:09,067
Please rest up.

102
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:24,268
I wonder what happened
to those girls who were captured.

103
00:11:25,769 --> 00:11:27,354
I really hope they're safe.

104
00:12:07,144 --> 00:12:08,520
What are you doing all of a sudden?

105
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:11,064
He's running so fast.

106
00:12:12,107 --> 00:12:13,609
The scent is getting stronger!

107
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:15,485
The demon has appeared!

108
00:12:20,073 --> 00:12:21,241
He jumped up to the roof!

109
00:12:21,825 --> 00:12:23,285
The stories of the demons...

110
00:12:23,911 --> 00:12:24,995
The Demon Slayer Corps...

111
00:12:25,537 --> 00:12:26,705
So it's all true.

112
00:12:37,549 --> 00:12:38,592
It's here!

113
00:12:39,593 --> 00:12:41,011
The demon is here right now!

114
00:12:46,016 --> 00:12:47,559
There are two scents.

115
00:12:48,143 --> 00:12:50,521
The scent of a demon
and a human girl.

116
00:12:53,232 --> 00:12:54,483
I don't see them around...

117
00:12:59,863 --> 00:13:00,989
But...

118
00:13:06,203 --> 00:13:08,288
The spot with the strongest scent...

119
00:13:09,206 --> 00:13:10,374
is here!

120
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:36,942
It's a mutated demon!

121
00:13:37,693 --> 00:13:39,194
Demons who use Blood Demon Arts,

122
00:13:39,194 --> 00:13:41,405
a type of special spell,

123
00:13:41,405 --> 00:13:42,990
are known as mutated demons.

124
00:13:43,365 --> 00:13:47,244
You'll probably be fighting
those kinds of demons in the future.

125
00:13:51,665 --> 00:13:54,209
Where are the girls
who were captured?

126
00:13:58,338 --> 00:14:00,465
Also, there are two other things
I want to ask!

127
00:14:11,101 --> 00:14:12,227
That guy is...

128
00:14:12,603 --> 00:14:13,687
Mr. Kazumi!

129
00:14:13,812 --> 00:14:16,732
Please hold on to her
and stand beside me.

130
00:14:17,065 --> 00:14:18,609
As long as you're standing
by my side,

131
00:14:18,609 --> 00:14:19,610
I'll be able to protect you guys.

132
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:24,573
The demon will probably...

133
00:14:24,948 --> 00:14:26,825
come out from
the ground or the wall.

134
00:14:29,036 --> 00:14:32,247
Or it could also appear
out of nowhere.

135
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:39,796
But even if this demon hides,

136
00:14:39,838 --> 00:14:41,381
its scent won't disappear.

137
00:14:45,928 --> 00:14:46,929
It's coming!

138
00:14:47,638 --> 00:14:48,805
Water Breathing!

139
00:14:48,847 --> 00:14:50,224
Fifth Form!

140
00:14:54,269 --> 00:14:55,437
Three demons?

141
00:14:59,149 --> 00:15:00,400
Calm down.

142
00:15:00,901 --> 00:15:02,110
I can solve this!

143
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:04,279
Eighth Form!

144
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:07,574
Waterfall Basin!

145
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:23,006
Tanjiro.

146
00:15:23,382 --> 00:15:24,591
Listen carefully.

147
00:15:26,051 --> 00:15:29,763
There is only one demon
in this world...

148
00:15:30,013 --> 00:15:31,139
that can use his blood...

149
00:15:31,682 --> 00:15:34,601
to turn humans into demons.

150
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:36,770
Only one?

151
00:15:37,187 --> 00:15:39,648
He's the one who was the first
to turn into a demon...

152
00:15:39,648 --> 00:15:42,234
a thousand years ago.

153
00:15:42,609 --> 00:15:43,610
In other words,

154
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:46,071
he is your family's enemy.

155
00:15:46,113 --> 00:15:47,739
And I think he probably knows...

156
00:15:48,115 --> 00:15:52,911
the way to turn your little sister
back into a human.

157
00:15:55,289 --> 00:15:57,332
That demon's name is...

158
00:16:02,796 --> 00:16:04,923
Kibutsuji Muzan!

159
00:16:05,799 --> 00:16:06,967
Eighth Form!

160
00:16:06,967 --> 00:16:08,135
Waterfall Basin!

161
00:16:10,804 --> 00:16:11,930
It wasn't deep enough!

162
00:16:12,598 --> 00:16:14,892
I couldn't hit the critical spots
of all the demons in one shot!

163
00:16:15,434 --> 00:16:17,644
It's because I changed forms midway!

164
00:16:26,945 --> 00:16:29,156
The scent of all three demons
are the same.

165
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,951
I heard demons generally
don't work in groups,

166
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:37,372
so this must be one demon
that has split into three.

167
00:16:38,415 --> 00:16:40,042
I have to protect these two...

168
00:16:40,167 --> 00:16:41,668
while slaying the three demons.

169
00:16:42,044 --> 00:16:43,462
I can't back down!

170
00:16:43,629 --> 00:16:45,339
I have to get answers...

171
00:16:45,547 --> 00:16:47,424
about Kibutsuji Muzan...

172
00:16:48,133 --> 00:16:51,303
and how to revert a demon
into human form!

173
00:16:53,055 --> 00:16:54,139
Total Concentration Breathing!

174
00:16:55,557 --> 00:16:56,767
Water Breathing!

175
00:16:57,601 --> 00:16:58,727
Second Form!

176
00:16:59,728 --> 00:17:01,104
Water Wheel!

177
00:17:04,358 --> 00:17:05,651
I didn't swing my sword
deep enough again!

178
00:17:14,868 --> 00:17:16,161
I can't keep chasing after him.

179
00:17:16,828 --> 00:17:18,330
I can't swing my sword
with full force...

180
00:17:18,455 --> 00:17:20,207
while protecting them
at the same time.

181
00:17:20,666 --> 00:17:22,417
You punk!

182
00:17:23,418 --> 00:17:25,045
Stop getting in the way!

183
00:17:25,045 --> 00:17:28,090
If this drags on, that girl's flesh
won't be fresh anymore!

184
00:17:28,882 --> 00:17:32,135
That girl is already 16 years old!

185
00:17:32,135 --> 00:17:33,428
If I don't devour her soon,

186
00:17:33,428 --> 00:17:36,014
her taste will deteriorate
by the minute!

187
00:17:41,937 --> 00:17:44,606
Hey, why don't you calm down?

188
00:17:45,065 --> 00:17:46,191
It's okay.

189
00:17:46,817 --> 00:17:48,819
Even if we can't eat her tonight,

190
00:17:49,361 --> 00:17:53,282
we've already consumed
many 16-year-old girls in this town.

191
00:17:53,574 --> 00:17:56,577
Their meats are of high quality
and very delicious.

192
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,996
I'm already very satisfied.

193
00:17:58,996 --> 00:18:00,998
But I'm not!

194
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:04,585
I want to keep eating!

195
00:18:05,669 --> 00:18:06,753
Monster!

196
00:18:07,254 --> 00:18:09,798
Give Satoko, the one you captured
the night before back to me!

197
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:21,185
Satoko...

198
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:24,938
Who are you talking about?

199
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:32,654
If her hairpin
is among these mementos,

200
00:18:32,863 --> 00:18:34,656
that means she has already
been eaten.

201
00:19:18,659 --> 00:19:19,826
I missed it again!

202
00:19:20,077 --> 00:19:21,745
He jumps back
into the ground so quickly!

203
00:19:22,746 --> 00:19:23,789
Darn!

204
00:19:23,789 --> 00:19:25,499
I'm too close to the wall!

205
00:19:41,139 --> 00:19:42,140
You're a human.

206
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:45,143
But why are you
accompanying a demon?

207
00:19:49,231 --> 00:19:50,732
What is this?

208
00:19:50,732 --> 00:19:52,442
What is their relationship?

209
00:19:53,151 --> 00:19:56,738
Can a swordsman and demon
work together?

210
00:20:03,871 --> 00:20:05,747
I don't understand this at all.

211
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:53,086
Nezuko!

212
00:20:58,342 --> 00:21:01,553
Perhaps this is just
an act of self-comfort.

213
00:21:01,553 --> 00:21:04,223
When Nezuko was in a deep sleep,

214
00:21:04,223 --> 00:21:06,350
I used suggestive hypnosis on her.

215
00:21:06,892 --> 00:21:07,976
Suggestive hypnosis?

216
00:21:08,477 --> 00:21:11,271
Humans are your family.

217
00:21:11,855 --> 00:21:13,607
You have to protect humans.

218
00:21:14,399 --> 00:21:16,193
Demons are your enemies!

219
00:21:23,492 --> 00:21:24,576
Nezuko!

220
00:21:24,576 --> 00:21:28,705
Don't have mercy on any demons
who harm humans!

221
00:23:00,005 --> 00:23:01,006
(Demon Slayer)

222
00:23:03,133 --> 00:23:05,177
That kick of yours
was a really big help!

223
00:23:05,177 --> 00:23:06,178
Thank you!

224
00:23:07,346 --> 00:23:09,681
It didn't break even though
you kicked so hard from the inside.

225
00:23:09,806 --> 00:23:12,100
This box sure is durable.

226
00:23:14,061 --> 00:23:16,438
But is it really cramped
inside the box?

227
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,606
Is it really uncomfortable?

228
00:23:17,648 --> 00:23:18,857
I'll hurry and find time...

229
00:23:18,899 --> 00:23:21,777
to make a bigger box for you!

230
00:23:24,071 --> 00:23:26,949
Now, let me tell you
a Taisho secret!

231
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:28,700
The demon that appeared this time...

232
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:30,035
grinds his teeth really loudly!

233
00:23:30,077 --> 00:23:33,080
Apparently, it was a habit of his
when he was still a human.

234
00:23:33,705 --> 00:23:36,416
Next, Episode 7, "Kibutsuji Muzan".

235
00:23:36,875 --> 00:23:40,045
