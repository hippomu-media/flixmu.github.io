1
00:00:00,459 --> 00:00:03,337
Nako, Kiyo, Sumi.

2
00:00:05,172 --> 00:00:07,549
I hope you can help me
with my training.

3
00:00:07,966 --> 00:00:09,176
While I'm sleeping,

4
00:00:09,218 --> 00:00:11,136
if I stop doing
Total Concentration Breathing,

5
00:00:11,178 --> 00:00:13,347
can you use comforter duster
and hit me hard?

6
00:00:14,681 --> 00:00:15,724
Please.

7
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:18,644
- All right, no problem.
- All right, no problem.

8
00:00:19,645 --> 00:00:20,938
Thank you.

9
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:33,242
Very good. No problem.

10
00:00:33,242 --> 00:00:35,994
- Tanjiro is working really hard.
- Yes.

11
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:57,391
(Demon Slayer)

12
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:16,762
(Episode 25: Tsuguko, Tsuyuri Kanao)

13
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:19,056
I'm so useless.

14
00:02:19,431 --> 00:02:21,058
Please help me again.

15
00:02:21,058 --> 00:02:22,059
- All right.
- All right.

16
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,101
Please.

17
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:24,353
- All the best.
- All the best.

18
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:26,271
I must succeed this time.

19
00:02:34,029 --> 00:02:36,406
Please help me once more!

20
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:39,201
You're the only one
here again, Tanjiro?

21
00:02:39,701 --> 00:02:40,953
I'm sorry.

22
00:02:40,953 --> 00:02:42,704
I told them to come.

23
00:02:43,497 --> 00:02:45,123
It doesn't matter to me.

24
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:48,252
I'll talk to them again later.

25
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:58,345
Generally, my body
has already gotten used...

26
00:02:58,345 --> 00:03:00,722
to training while doing
Total Concentration Breathing.

27
00:03:01,056 --> 00:03:02,683
If I don't put in all my efforts,

28
00:03:02,683 --> 00:03:05,894
I can't keep doing Total
Concentration Breathing all day.

29
00:03:06,854 --> 00:03:10,148
But I know that the longer I can do
Total Concentration Breathing,

30
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:12,568
the better my stamina will be!

31
00:03:30,794 --> 00:03:32,254
- All the best!
- All the best!

32
00:03:43,432 --> 00:03:44,433
I can catch up to her.

33
00:03:44,808 --> 00:03:46,685
I can already catch up to her.

34
00:03:47,144 --> 00:03:48,395
I can catch up to her speed!

35
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:04,536
It hurts.

36
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:10,042
Thank you.

37
00:04:16,924 --> 00:04:19,051
Zenitsu, Inosuke.

38
00:04:20,636 --> 00:04:22,429
I don't care about them.

39
00:04:33,524 --> 00:04:36,235
- All the best!
- All the best!

40
00:04:45,077 --> 00:04:47,204
I broke it!

41
00:04:49,373 --> 00:04:52,918
- Next is this big calabash.
- All right.

42
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:54,628
Great!

43
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:56,255
Just a little bit more.

44
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:57,381
Thank you, girls.

45
00:04:57,422 --> 00:04:58,674
This is bad.

46
00:05:12,855 --> 00:05:15,524
Tanjiro already went for training.

47
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:18,193
The sun has just risen.

48
00:05:19,695 --> 00:05:21,780
I'm most scared of working hard.

49
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:24,867
It's so draining to steadily put
an effort to make solid progress.

50
00:05:27,619 --> 00:05:28,745
Oh, it's you.

51
00:05:29,288 --> 00:05:32,124
Do you feel anxious because
I'm falling behind Tanjiro now?

52
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:34,126
Even if he teaches me
very carefully,

53
00:05:34,126 --> 00:05:35,919
I still won't be able
to remember it.

54
00:05:36,545 --> 00:05:39,214
I think we're really bad.

55
00:05:40,591 --> 00:05:42,801
Did you just say the same?

56
00:05:43,093 --> 00:05:44,845
Even so, that's still out of line.

57
00:05:44,845 --> 00:05:46,763
"You work hard too."

58
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:48,599
At least say that to me.

59
00:05:50,225 --> 00:05:52,019
Did you say, "Work harder"?

60
00:05:52,644 --> 00:05:55,189
Gosh, I really don't know
what to do with you.

61
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:04,990
It tastes so bad.

62
00:06:13,582 --> 00:06:15,250
Let's go, Monitsu.

63
00:06:16,835 --> 00:06:19,630
Tanjiro is planning to learn...

64
00:06:19,755 --> 00:06:22,549
Total Concentration Breathing,
Constant technique.

65
00:06:23,425 --> 00:06:27,179
By doing Total Concentration
Breathing all day,

66
00:06:27,179 --> 00:06:29,848
your stamina level will improve
by leaps and bounds.

67
00:06:35,687 --> 00:06:37,481
Let's try it now.

68
00:06:42,027 --> 00:06:43,820
I can't do it!

69
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,697
I really can't do it!

70
00:06:46,281 --> 00:06:47,950
If I don't use all my efforts,

71
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:51,078
I can't do Total Concentration
Breathing all day as well.

72
00:06:51,078 --> 00:06:53,121
Zenitsu, Inosuke,
you can surely do it too.

73
00:06:53,497 --> 00:06:56,750
You must extend your lungs this way.

74
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,085
Once your blood goes into shock,

75
00:06:58,085 --> 00:07:00,295
your bones and muscles would go
"vroom, vroom".

76
00:07:00,295 --> 00:07:01,880
At that point, you must maintain it.

77
00:07:05,259 --> 00:07:07,219
Then train as hard as you can.

78
00:07:12,724 --> 00:07:14,017
Goodness.

79
00:07:14,017 --> 00:07:15,644
This is a basic technique.

80
00:07:15,644 --> 00:07:17,271
It's a beginner skill.

81
00:07:17,271 --> 00:07:19,189
Even if it's natural for you
to learn it,

82
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:22,401
you must still put in your efforts.

83
00:07:29,283 --> 00:07:32,035
It's natural to learn it anyway.

84
00:07:33,829 --> 00:07:36,790
I think you can easily
learn it, Inosuke.

85
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:38,417
You still can't learn it?

86
00:07:38,417 --> 00:07:40,419
Learning it is natural.

87
00:07:40,878 --> 00:07:43,422
If you can't learn it,
we can't do anything about it.

88
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:45,591
There's nothing we can do.

89
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:49,720
What?

90
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,013
I can learn it!

91
00:07:51,013 --> 00:07:52,097
Of course I can!

92
00:07:52,097 --> 00:07:53,432
Don't mock me!

93
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:55,392
Watch it or I'll rip your chest off!

94
00:07:57,561 --> 00:07:59,688
Please work hard, Zenitsu.

95
00:07:59,688 --> 00:08:01,815
I'll cheer for you more than anyone.

96
00:08:02,608 --> 00:08:06,069
Yes!

97
00:08:17,456 --> 00:08:18,957
Kanao, you're in
the same batch as them.

98
00:08:18,957 --> 00:08:20,000
What if you train together?

99
00:08:37,976 --> 00:08:43,190
- Put in more effort!
- You weakling!

100
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,443
Well done, Zenitsu!

101
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:57,329
(Heads)

102
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:23,105
It hurts.

103
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:26,358
I'm starving.

104
00:09:27,526 --> 00:09:28,777
Sad.

105
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:31,029
Empty.

106
00:09:32,489 --> 00:09:33,699
Painful.

107
00:09:34,992 --> 00:09:36,243
Lonely.

108
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:39,538
That's my life every day.

109
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,458
But one day,

110
00:09:44,668 --> 00:09:46,503
I heard a sound.

111
00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:54,970
I'll never be in pain again.

112
00:10:05,898 --> 00:10:08,066
I'll never be in pain again.

113
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:11,361
In a life of poverty,

114
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,906
even when my parents sold me,

115
00:10:14,364 --> 00:10:15,991
I didn't feel sad.

116
00:10:19,828 --> 00:10:20,829
Excuse me.

117
00:10:20,829 --> 00:10:22,581
Do you have a minute?

118
00:10:28,337 --> 00:10:31,673
Why is this child tied up?

119
00:10:32,007 --> 00:10:33,967
Is she a criminal
or is there another reason?

120
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:35,469
You should be able to tell.

121
00:10:35,469 --> 00:10:37,596
She's filthy and full of lice.

122
00:10:37,638 --> 00:10:40,182
And she might even run away.

123
00:10:42,601 --> 00:10:44,603
Nice to meet you. How are you?

124
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:47,606
My name is Kocho Kanae.

125
00:10:48,106 --> 00:10:49,483
What is your name?

126
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:58,367
She doesn't have a name.

127
00:10:58,367 --> 00:10:59,910
Her parents didn't give her a name.

128
00:11:00,702 --> 00:11:01,745
Are you done?

129
00:11:01,745 --> 00:11:02,829
Move.

130
00:11:05,541 --> 00:11:07,501
Please don't touch my sister.

131
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:10,587
What did you say?

132
00:11:10,712 --> 00:11:13,382
If you want to talk to this kid,
pay me!

133
00:11:15,259 --> 00:11:17,261
I'll buy this kid then.

134
00:11:17,553 --> 00:11:19,012
Are these enough?

135
00:11:28,856 --> 00:11:30,274
Stop, don't go!

136
00:11:30,274 --> 00:11:32,651
You better pick up the money.

137
00:11:32,651 --> 00:11:35,028
It's crowded here
and the wind is strong.

138
00:11:36,113 --> 00:11:38,282
- Is it okay to do this?
- It's fine.

139
00:11:38,282 --> 00:11:40,200
I'm really sorry.

140
00:11:40,242 --> 00:11:42,870
Don't pick it up! It's my money!

141
00:11:43,412 --> 00:11:44,872
My goodness.

142
00:12:07,603 --> 00:12:09,563
Kanae.

143
00:12:09,771 --> 00:12:12,482
Kanae, this kid is hopeless!

144
00:12:15,402 --> 00:12:17,613
She wouldn't do anything
unless you tell her to.

145
00:12:17,613 --> 00:12:19,031
Even eating.

146
00:12:19,031 --> 00:12:20,407
If you don't tell her to eat,

147
00:12:20,407 --> 00:12:21,825
she wouldn't eat.

148
00:12:21,825 --> 00:12:23,869
She'd rather let her stomach growl!

149
00:12:24,494 --> 00:12:25,996
My goodness.

150
00:12:26,121 --> 00:12:28,290
What should we do with this kid?

151
00:12:28,457 --> 00:12:29,499
That's enough.

152
00:12:29,499 --> 00:12:30,918
Stop saying things out of anger.

153
00:12:31,168 --> 00:12:33,921
I love your smile the most, Shinobu.

154
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:39,218
But a child who doesn't use her own
brain to think and act won't do.

155
00:12:39,218 --> 00:12:40,260
It's too dangerous.

156
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,346
You're right.

157
00:12:42,346 --> 00:12:43,889
She doesn't know
how to do anything...

158
00:12:43,889 --> 00:12:45,432
and she can't make decisions.

159
00:12:46,308 --> 00:12:47,935
When you're alone,

160
00:12:47,935 --> 00:12:50,354
you can toss this coin
to help you make decisions.

161
00:12:50,646 --> 00:12:51,939
All right, Kanao?

162
00:12:52,189 --> 00:12:53,690
Kanae!

163
00:12:54,066 --> 00:12:56,818
You don't need to make
a big deal about it.

164
00:12:57,152 --> 00:12:59,029
Kanao is a very cute child.

165
00:12:59,029 --> 00:13:00,739
That doesn't make sense!

166
00:13:01,156 --> 00:13:02,950
If she gets an opportunity,

167
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:04,701
she'd be able
to open herself up naturally.

168
00:13:04,701 --> 00:13:05,744
Don't worry.

169
00:13:05,911 --> 00:13:08,580
If she meets a boy
whom she likes someday,

170
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:10,415
Kanao would change.

171
00:13:15,337 --> 00:13:16,380
Very good.

172
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:17,464
That's it!

173
00:13:18,048 --> 00:13:19,049
That's how it is!

174
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:22,261
You can do it, Zenitsu!

175
00:13:22,261 --> 00:13:23,512
Maintain it!

176
00:13:23,512 --> 00:13:24,805
Very good!

177
00:13:37,359 --> 00:13:39,152
Inosuke!

178
00:13:39,778 --> 00:13:42,739
Our new Nichirin Blades
are almost here.

179
00:13:42,739 --> 00:13:44,116
- Really?
- Yes.

180
00:13:44,116 --> 00:13:45,784
Kasugai crow told me just now.

181
00:13:46,994 --> 00:13:49,079
It's Mr. Haganezuka's smell!

182
00:13:50,956 --> 00:13:52,666
Hurry!

183
00:13:55,252 --> 00:13:56,670
Mr. Haganezuka.

184
00:13:58,589 --> 00:14:00,716
Mr. Haganezuka!

185
00:14:02,467 --> 00:14:05,220
It has been a while!

186
00:14:07,139 --> 00:14:09,016
How have you been?

187
00:14:12,227 --> 00:14:13,312
Die!

188
00:14:14,188 --> 00:14:16,106
Mr. Haganezuka...

189
00:14:16,773 --> 00:14:20,402
How dare you break my sword.

190
00:14:20,402 --> 00:14:22,821
You've got a lot of nerves!

191
00:14:22,821 --> 00:14:23,822
I'm sorry.

192
00:14:23,864 --> 00:14:25,532
But then,

193
00:14:25,574 --> 00:14:27,159
I really almost died.

194
00:14:27,159 --> 00:14:29,119
My opponent was very powerful too.

195
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:30,287
That's not right.

196
00:14:30,287 --> 00:14:31,705
What does this have to do
with your opponent?

197
00:14:31,705 --> 00:14:34,666
It's you, it's all your effort.

198
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:35,709
Because you're weak.

199
00:14:35,709 --> 00:14:37,294
That's why the sword broke.

200
00:14:37,294 --> 00:14:39,796
Otherwise, why would my sword break?

201
00:14:39,838 --> 00:14:40,923
But...

202
00:14:41,089 --> 00:14:43,300
I'm going to kill you!

203
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:50,349
Is this a new form of training?

204
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:52,142
I don't think so.

205
00:14:54,811 --> 00:14:55,896
Well...

206
00:14:55,896 --> 00:14:58,815
Mr. Haganezuka
is a very passionate person.

207
00:14:59,233 --> 00:15:00,275
Right.

208
00:15:00,275 --> 00:15:02,861
He loves swords more than anyone.

209
00:15:03,445 --> 00:15:06,740
It's very hard to find someone
like him in the Swordsmith Village.

210
00:15:07,616 --> 00:15:08,700
I think so too.

211
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:13,747
My name is Kanamori.

212
00:15:14,081 --> 00:15:16,750
I made Mr. Inosuke's sword.

213
00:15:17,543 --> 00:15:20,045
I feel very honored to make
a contribution in the battle.

214
00:15:28,762 --> 00:15:30,138
It's really nice.

215
00:15:30,347 --> 00:15:32,266
Indigo-gray in color
with a misty glow.

216
00:15:32,266 --> 00:15:33,642
It's a very profound color.

217
00:15:33,642 --> 00:15:35,394
It's an excellent color
that meets the sword's need.

218
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:36,520
This is great.

219
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:39,398
Inosuke's sword originally suffered
a lot of damage.

220
00:15:41,733 --> 00:15:43,777
How does the sword feel
in your hands?

221
00:15:43,777 --> 00:15:45,654
Actually, it's my first time...

222
00:15:45,696 --> 00:15:48,282
to make a sword
for a double-sworded swordsman.

223
00:15:49,616 --> 00:15:50,909
Mr. Inosuke?

224
00:16:05,716 --> 00:16:06,717
Very nice.

225
00:16:07,259 --> 00:16:09,178
I'm going to kill you, you jerk!

226
00:16:09,178 --> 00:16:12,055
- Look at what you've done!
- I'm sorry!

227
00:16:17,144 --> 00:16:21,899
- I'm going to kill you!
- I'm sorry!

228
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:23,901
This is ridiculous.

229
00:16:23,901 --> 00:16:25,402
- Why is there such a guy?
- I'm sorry!

230
00:16:25,402 --> 00:16:27,112
- He's hitting it with a stone!
- I'm sorry!

231
00:16:27,112 --> 00:16:29,615
- It's ridiculous!
- I'm sorry!

232
00:16:37,748 --> 00:16:39,082
I think there's no problem now.

233
00:16:39,082 --> 00:16:41,710
Tanjiro is working very hard.

234
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:43,837
Let's make rice balls for him again.

235
00:16:54,973 --> 00:16:56,975
My body has changed.

236
00:16:56,975 --> 00:16:58,602
I want to wield my sword soon.

237
00:16:58,977 --> 00:17:02,189
I want to use my hand to wield
the Nichirin Blade!

238
00:17:05,067 --> 00:17:07,194
I caught her!

239
00:17:10,739 --> 00:17:12,950
They're evenly matched.

240
00:17:14,451 --> 00:17:15,869
I must persevere.

241
00:17:15,869 --> 00:17:17,246
I have a chance of winning.

242
00:17:20,332 --> 00:17:21,834
I dodged her!

243
00:17:22,376 --> 00:17:24,211
See what I can do!

244
00:17:24,419 --> 00:17:26,088
That liquid medicine stinks.

245
00:17:26,129 --> 00:17:27,840
Whoever gets splashed
would be so pitiful.

246
00:17:33,136 --> 00:17:34,388
He won!

247
00:17:34,388 --> 00:17:35,430
Is that considered a win?

248
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:37,724
It's the same whether you splash it
or put it on one's head.

249
00:17:39,142 --> 00:17:41,144
This is great! I succeeded!

250
00:17:41,186 --> 00:17:42,312
- This isn't good.
- This isn't good.

251
00:17:49,069 --> 00:17:51,905
I don't want to lose!

252
00:17:54,032 --> 00:17:55,993
Come on, open your mouth.

253
00:17:59,413 --> 00:18:01,498
It looks like your jaw is fine now.

254
00:18:01,623 --> 00:18:03,709
All right, please close your mouth.

255
00:18:04,543 --> 00:18:06,044
That's all for your examination.

256
00:18:06,461 --> 00:18:08,422
You're fine now.

257
00:18:08,422 --> 00:18:10,716
You may accept your tasks
without any worries.

258
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:13,260
So, I'm done with training?

259
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:14,261
Yes.

260
00:18:14,261 --> 00:18:16,305
You'll only have to face
real battles from now on.

261
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:17,472
Yes.

262
00:18:17,806 --> 00:18:19,474
By the way, Ms. Shinobu.

263
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:21,643
There's something I want to ask you.

264
00:18:21,894 --> 00:18:23,061
What is it?

265
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,356
Have you heard of
the Dance of the Fire God?

266
00:18:26,481 --> 00:18:27,649
I haven't.

267
00:18:28,775 --> 00:18:32,154
Then what about Sun Breathing
and the like?

268
00:18:32,154 --> 00:18:33,280
I haven't heard of that.

269
00:18:35,741 --> 00:18:39,494
Actually, these happened
when I was little.

270
00:18:39,494 --> 00:18:40,621
Right.

271
00:18:42,247 --> 00:18:43,498
I see.

272
00:18:43,832 --> 00:18:47,878
I wonder why your dad used
Sun Breathing technique.

273
00:18:48,754 --> 00:18:50,422
Based on what I know,

274
00:18:50,422 --> 00:18:52,424
there's a Flame Breathing technique,

275
00:18:52,424 --> 00:18:54,510
but no Sun Breathing technique.

276
00:18:55,511 --> 00:18:57,179
Are they different?

277
00:18:57,513 --> 00:18:59,848
I'm not too sure about the details.

278
00:19:00,224 --> 00:19:01,475
I'm sorry.

279
00:19:01,725 --> 00:19:05,604
It’s just that there's a very strict
distinction about that type of term.

280
00:19:06,188 --> 00:19:09,650
We can't call Flame Breathing
as Sun Breathing.

281
00:19:09,816 --> 00:19:13,695
Perhaps the Flame Hashira,
Mr. Rengoku, might know.

282
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:16,323
It's just that he's out
for a task now.

283
00:19:17,115 --> 00:19:18,242
All right.

284
00:19:18,575 --> 00:19:21,078
Thank you for telling me
about these things.

285
00:19:21,328 --> 00:19:24,331
I'll ask Mr. Rengoku
the next time I see him.

286
00:19:24,706 --> 00:19:27,167
- All right.
- I'll get going then.

287
00:19:27,417 --> 00:19:29,378
- Kamado.
- Yes.

288
00:19:31,004 --> 00:19:32,506
I'm looking forward
to see you perform.

289
00:19:35,425 --> 00:19:36,468
All right.

290
00:19:53,026 --> 00:19:54,903
She's still sleeping today as usual.

291
00:19:59,032 --> 00:20:03,287
I heard that perhaps you rely
on sleep to recover your strength,

292
00:20:04,121 --> 00:20:07,040
but if you don't open your eyes
from time to time,

293
00:20:07,207 --> 00:20:08,667
I'd still feel worried.

294
00:20:14,131 --> 00:20:18,302
It's about time for me to leave
and go on a task.

295
00:20:19,052 --> 00:20:20,470
My body has already recovered...

296
00:20:20,721 --> 00:20:22,181
and I've become a bit stronger.

297
00:20:22,681 --> 00:20:23,807
Now, I'm still doing...

298
00:20:23,807 --> 00:20:25,225
Total Concentration Breathing,
Constant technique.

299
00:20:26,435 --> 00:20:29,730
And I think Zenitsu and Inosuke
will also come with us.

300
00:20:30,355 --> 00:20:32,566
I feel at ease having them with us.

301
00:20:35,819 --> 00:20:36,820
I see.

302
00:20:37,196 --> 00:20:38,697
Nezuko, you feel the same way.

303
00:20:39,823 --> 00:20:41,200
They're both good people.

304
00:20:42,117 --> 00:20:43,869
In order to turn you back
into a human again, Nezuko,

305
00:20:44,453 --> 00:20:46,622
I must do my best
to defeat powerful demons...

306
00:20:46,622 --> 00:20:48,790
and send their blood samples
to Lady Tamayo.

307
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:52,044
Can I do that?

308
00:20:53,212 --> 00:20:55,172
There wouldn't be
a problem, Tanjiro.

309
00:21:04,848 --> 00:21:06,141
Thank you, Nezuko.

310
00:21:06,433 --> 00:21:07,935
You're encouraging me, aren't you?

311
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:10,145
I'll work hard.

312
00:23:00,088 --> 00:23:01,089
(Demon Slayer)

313
00:23:03,008 --> 00:23:05,719
It's so tiring to keep doing
Total Concentration Breathing.

314
00:23:05,719 --> 00:23:07,679
I couldn't learn it at all. Darn it.

315
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:10,140
Both of you are utterly exhausted.

316
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:11,225
Oh right.

317
00:23:11,225 --> 00:23:14,102
Now, let me tell you
a Taisho secret!

318
00:23:14,102 --> 00:23:16,313
If you pour the liquid medicine
used during reflex training...

319
00:23:16,313 --> 00:23:17,356
into the bathtub,

320
00:23:17,397 --> 00:23:19,024
I heard that
it can eliminate stress...

321
00:23:19,066 --> 00:23:20,692
and boost the recovery of wounds.

322
00:23:21,026 --> 00:23:22,486
I'm going for training now.

323
00:23:22,486 --> 00:23:24,154
Rest for a while, you two.

324
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:26,782
I can still go on!
Don't belittle me!

325
00:23:26,782 --> 00:23:28,659
We're still training?

326
00:23:28,659 --> 00:23:31,370
Fine, I'll go!

327
00:23:31,370 --> 00:23:34,289
Next, Episode 26, "New Mission".

328
00:23:34,414 --> 00:23:36,166
I'll get going then, Nezuko.

329
00:23:37,501 --> 00:23:39,962
(To be continued)
