1
00:00:07,633 --> 00:00:08,634
Tanjiro.

2
00:00:11,261 --> 00:00:12,304
You...

3
00:00:14,598 --> 00:00:16,683
The Demon Slayer Corps...

4
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:19,686
is not a place
where you can fool around!

5
00:00:19,728 --> 00:00:22,272
People like you
should be eliminated.

6
00:00:22,648 --> 00:00:24,650
Eliminated, now!

7
00:00:24,983 --> 00:00:28,946
Don't ever look down
on the Demon Slayer Corps!

8
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:45,671
(Demon Slayer)

9
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:17,679
Nezuko.

10
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:22,434
Nezuko.

11
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:34,988
Nezuko!

12
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:39,910
Zenitsu, can you please
behave yourself?

13
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:44,706
Tanjiro.

14
00:02:49,044 --> 00:02:51,630
Let's get along, Tanjiro!

15
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:55,551
- Zenitsu, don't come near me!
- Tanjiro.

16
00:02:55,551 --> 00:02:58,345
Don't say that, Tanjiro!

17
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:00,472
Nezuko!

18
00:03:00,514 --> 00:03:03,392
- Zenitsu, don't be like this!
- Tanjiro! Nezuko!

19
00:03:03,392 --> 00:03:04,935
Tanjiro!

20
00:03:04,935 --> 00:03:07,938
- I'm so hungry...
- Nezuko! Tanjiro!

21
00:03:09,815 --> 00:03:11,817
Sorry for disturbing you.

22
00:03:17,656 --> 00:03:22,160
Your clothes are really dirty.

23
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:26,290
I'll clean them
and return them to you.

24
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:29,126
Please wear this for now.

25
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:35,424
It's very nice and comfortable.

26
00:03:40,304 --> 00:03:44,016
I've prepared tempuras
for dinner. Is that okay?

27
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:49,521
It's the one coated with flour.

28
00:03:51,815 --> 00:03:54,067
Wait!

29
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:55,152
Wait.

30
00:03:55,152 --> 00:03:58,071
Nezuko, Tanjiro!

31
00:04:01,617 --> 00:04:03,619
What is it?

32
00:04:06,455 --> 00:04:07,539
Wait!

33
00:04:07,539 --> 00:04:10,083
Just wait, Inosuke!

34
00:04:11,543 --> 00:04:13,587
Tanjiro!

35
00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:20,010
(Episode 15: Mount Natagumo)

36
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:28,101
All three of you have recovered.

37
00:04:48,497 --> 00:04:51,625
Northeast!

38
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:54,461
Your next destination is northeast.

39
00:04:54,586 --> 00:04:57,381
The three of you
shall head to Mount Natagumo.

40
00:04:57,381 --> 00:04:59,675
Head to Mount Natagumo.

41
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:09,309
We're setting off now.

42
00:05:10,936 --> 00:05:12,271
Thank you so much
for taking care of us.

43
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:19,736
Now, let me set off
the sparks of luck.

44
00:05:20,362 --> 00:05:21,738
Thank you.

45
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:30,747
What are you doing, old lady?

46
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:32,833
Are you an idiot?

47
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:36,128
She's striking sparks
from a firestone.

48
00:05:36,128 --> 00:05:37,713
It's for good luck!

49
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:39,423
It's because we're going
on a dangerous mission!

50
00:05:41,717 --> 00:05:46,847
Always stay proud of yourselves
and live life to the fullest.

51
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:49,641
I wish you all the best of luck
in your battle.

52
00:05:56,982 --> 00:06:01,320
(Wisteria)

53
00:06:05,616 --> 00:06:06,950
"Stay proud of yourselves"?

54
00:06:07,201 --> 00:06:08,202
"Best of luck in your battle"?

55
00:06:08,285 --> 00:06:09,286
What does that mean?

56
00:06:09,912 --> 00:06:11,914
You're seriously so clueless.

57
00:06:12,998 --> 00:06:14,082
He's right.

58
00:06:14,249 --> 00:06:16,668
Those phrases are quite hard
to understand.

59
00:06:17,044 --> 00:06:18,337
"Stay proud of yourselves"...

60
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:21,465
That means we should know
our place...

61
00:06:21,465 --> 00:06:23,759
and stay on the right track...

62
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:25,511
while keeping a clear conscience.

63
00:06:25,511 --> 00:06:26,595
Something like that.

64
00:06:27,888 --> 00:06:31,642
Also, the old lady wished us
a safe trip.

65
00:06:32,267 --> 00:06:34,228
What kind of track is that?

66
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:36,772
And what does
a clear conscience mean?

67
00:06:37,523 --> 00:06:38,565
Well...

68
00:06:38,565 --> 00:06:41,443
How exactly do you stay
on the right track?

69
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:44,613
Also, why did the old lady
wish us a safe trip?

70
00:06:44,988 --> 00:06:48,283
Why would an old lady who's
completely unrelated to me do that?

71
00:06:49,368 --> 00:06:51,662
She's the one
who doesn't know her place!

72
00:06:54,998 --> 00:06:56,124
He's getting faster.

73
00:06:57,543 --> 00:06:59,545
I won't lose to you!

74
00:07:00,379 --> 00:07:03,006
Wait for me!

75
00:07:13,058 --> 00:07:14,101
Wait!

76
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,019
Can you guys wait up?

77
00:07:17,187 --> 00:07:19,273
Zenitsu, what happened to you?

78
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:21,191
I'm so scared!

79
00:07:21,191 --> 00:07:22,693
The fact that we're getting closer
to our destination...

80
00:07:22,734 --> 00:07:23,944
absolutely terrifies me!

81
00:07:24,903 --> 00:07:26,572
Why are you sitting down?

82
00:07:26,697 --> 00:07:28,365
You disgust me.

83
00:07:28,532 --> 00:07:30,951
You have no right
to criticize me, pig head!

84
00:07:31,285 --> 00:07:32,536
Don't you guys feel anything...

85
00:07:32,578 --> 00:07:34,621
seeing that mountain ahead of us?

86
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:46,383
Even so, you can't just sit there.

87
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,760
You really are a disgusting guy.

88
00:07:48,927 --> 00:07:51,263
I'm not disgusting! I'm very normal!

89
00:07:51,263 --> 00:07:52,347
I'm normal!

90
00:07:52,347 --> 00:07:54,057
You guys are the ones
who are strange!

91
00:08:01,565 --> 00:08:02,649
What happened?

92
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:04,526
Hurry up and tell me.

93
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:07,029
What is that smell?

94
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:09,323
Tanjiro, wait!

95
00:08:09,323 --> 00:08:11,742
Geez! Don't leave me alone!

96
00:08:11,742 --> 00:08:13,660
Don't abandon me!

97
00:08:26,465 --> 00:08:29,092
Help...

98
00:08:29,968 --> 00:08:31,303
He's wearing our uniform.

99
00:08:31,428 --> 00:08:32,429
He's also a member
of the Demon Slayer Corps.

100
00:08:32,513 --> 00:08:33,805
Something must have happened.

101
00:08:35,224 --> 00:08:36,350
Wait!

102
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:37,434
Are you okay?

103
00:08:37,643 --> 00:08:38,685
What happened to you?

104
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:45,859
They are taking me away too!

105
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:48,987
Save me!

106
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:06,421
I have to go save him.

107
00:09:09,842 --> 00:09:11,468
I'll go first.

108
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:14,930
You guys can tremble in fear
and follow behind me.

109
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:17,182
I'm starving.

110
00:09:18,308 --> 00:09:19,476
Inosuke.

111
00:09:20,811 --> 00:09:22,688
He can't wait to show
his moves, can he?

112
00:10:31,089 --> 00:10:32,174
What is this?

113
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:42,601
They're spiderwebs.

114
00:10:45,354 --> 00:10:47,439
Why are there spiderwebs everywhere?

115
00:10:47,439 --> 00:10:48,607
This is so bothersome!

116
00:10:49,066 --> 00:10:50,234
Right.

117
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:52,861
Inosuke.

118
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:54,071
What?

119
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:56,031
Thank you.

120
00:10:57,616 --> 00:10:59,660
I feel so relieved...

121
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:01,161
because you agreed to come with me.

122
00:11:03,372 --> 00:11:06,834
The twisted and ominous scent
coming from the mountain...

123
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:09,586
made me feel
kind of nervous and stiff.

124
00:11:10,504 --> 00:11:11,547
Thank you.

125
00:11:16,176 --> 00:11:20,347
It's very nice and comfortable.

126
00:11:20,472 --> 00:11:25,394
Always stay proud of yourselves
and live life to the fullest.

127
00:11:25,477 --> 00:11:27,271
I wish you all the best of luck
in your battle.

128
00:11:31,316 --> 00:11:32,317
Inosuke.

129
00:11:37,447 --> 00:11:38,448
Let's go.

130
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:44,454
(Slayer)

131
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:50,502
I'm here as a backup.

132
00:11:50,752 --> 00:11:52,296
I'm a Mizunoto.

133
00:11:52,462 --> 00:11:53,672
My name is Kamado Tanjiro.

134
00:11:54,339 --> 00:11:55,507
Mizunoto...

135
00:11:56,466 --> 00:11:57,759
Mizunoto?

136
00:11:58,427 --> 00:12:00,429
Why didn't they send
a Hashira member?

137
00:12:01,013 --> 00:12:03,682
It's the same no matter how many
Mizunoto slayers they send.

138
00:12:03,682 --> 00:12:04,933
It's pointless.

139
00:12:06,435 --> 00:12:07,728
Inosuke!

140
00:12:07,728 --> 00:12:08,812
Cut the crap!

141
00:12:08,979 --> 00:12:10,856
If that's all you worry about,

142
00:12:10,898 --> 00:12:14,067
your existence itself is pointless!

143
00:12:14,359 --> 00:12:17,946
Hurry up and explain the situation,
you weakling!

144
00:12:18,113 --> 00:12:19,865
What's the matter with this guy?

145
00:12:19,865 --> 00:12:21,950
I'm the one who's senior here.

146
00:12:22,659 --> 00:12:26,246
I received a command
from one of the crows.

147
00:12:26,622 --> 00:12:29,333
A total of 10 slayers
were sent here.

148
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:34,379
Not long after
we entered the mountain,

149
00:12:34,796 --> 00:12:35,964
the members...

150
00:12:53,941 --> 00:12:56,235
The members
started killing each other.

151
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:09,373
I...

152
00:13:12,751 --> 00:13:13,752
I...

153
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:22,261
You sure flew back
as fast as you could.

154
00:13:23,345 --> 00:13:27,266
Have most of my swordsmen
been annihilated?

155
00:13:28,517 --> 00:13:31,144
The Twelve Demon Moons may be there.

156
00:13:32,521 --> 00:13:35,357
It looks like we'll have to send
the Hashira members there now.

157
00:13:40,445 --> 00:13:41,446
Giyu.

158
00:13:43,615 --> 00:13:44,616
Shinobu.

159
00:13:47,452 --> 00:13:48,453
- Your wish is my command.
- Your wish is my command.

160
00:13:50,581 --> 00:13:53,458
How nice would it be if humans
and demons could get along in peace.

161
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,878
Mr. Tomioka, don't you agree?

162
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:58,172
That's completely impossible...

163
00:13:58,463 --> 00:14:00,507
if demons continue eating humans.

164
00:14:02,134 --> 00:14:09,933
(Demon Slayer)

165
00:14:11,143 --> 00:14:13,520
Do they hate me now?

166
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,940
Would people normally abandon...

167
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:19,151
their comrades on the roads?

168
00:14:19,735 --> 00:14:21,778
Wouldn't comrades usually come
and encourage you?

169
00:14:22,696 --> 00:14:25,115
- If they came to persuade me,
- Zenitsu.

170
00:14:25,115 --> 00:14:26,825
I'd be willing to go too.

171
00:14:27,784 --> 00:14:29,286
But those two...

172
00:14:29,578 --> 00:14:32,414
They just sped towards
the creepy mountain...

173
00:14:33,624 --> 00:14:35,918
and didn't even consider
how I'd feel being left alone here.

174
00:14:43,509 --> 00:14:45,552
(It's meaningless for you
to keep sulking here.)

175
00:14:45,594 --> 00:14:47,095
(You should go
and save your comrades.)

176
00:14:49,223 --> 00:14:51,099
You're lucky that
you can say that so easily.

177
00:14:51,475 --> 00:14:54,394
You don't understand humans at all.

178
00:14:55,604 --> 00:14:57,940
That hurts!

179
00:14:58,106 --> 00:14:59,733
You're not cute at all!

180
00:14:59,733 --> 00:15:03,445
Your lecturing is such a turn-off!

181
00:15:03,946 --> 00:15:06,281
Nezuko is so cute even as a demon!

182
00:15:06,323 --> 00:15:08,492
You're a sparrow,
yet you're so mean!

183
00:15:10,869 --> 00:15:13,789
That punk took Nezuko away!

184
00:15:14,039 --> 00:15:17,209
Why did he have to take away
Nezuko, the one I value the most?

185
00:15:17,209 --> 00:15:19,336
Tanjiro is horrible!

186
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:21,588
How can he bring a girl
to such a dangerous place?

187
00:15:21,588 --> 00:15:23,048
Idiot!

188
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:26,844
Nezuko!

189
00:15:35,477 --> 00:15:37,729
What is that sound?

190
00:15:38,355 --> 00:15:39,439
There it is again.

191
00:15:40,607 --> 00:15:42,276
It's that sound again.

192
00:15:42,651 --> 00:15:44,236
That's the sound I heard earlier.

193
00:15:44,278 --> 00:15:45,904
And before I knew it,

194
00:15:45,904 --> 00:15:47,239
the members
were at each other's throats.

195
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:49,783
Where is the sound coming from?

196
00:16:32,659 --> 00:16:34,703
Those guys are all morons.

197
00:16:34,703 --> 00:16:36,288
Don't they know it's taboo...

198
00:16:36,288 --> 00:16:38,165
for members to point their swords
at each other?

199
00:16:38,165 --> 00:16:39,249
That's not it.

200
00:16:39,291 --> 00:16:40,584
Their actions are really strange.

201
00:16:40,751 --> 00:16:43,003
It looks like something
is controlling them.

202
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:44,171
Okay.

203
00:16:45,422 --> 00:16:47,299
Watch me split them into halves!

204
00:16:47,299 --> 00:16:48,383
No!

205
00:16:48,592 --> 00:16:49,676
They're still alive.

206
00:16:49,843 --> 00:16:51,553
Some of them are still alive.

207
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:55,682
Plus, we cannot hurt the corpses
of our comrades!

208
00:16:57,226 --> 00:17:01,480
Stop rejecting my ideas!

209
00:17:15,786 --> 00:17:18,997
There's a peculiar sweet scent
behind them.

210
00:17:26,213 --> 00:17:27,256
They're threads.

211
00:17:27,297 --> 00:17:28,841
They're being manipulated
by the threads!

212
00:17:29,049 --> 00:17:30,133
Cut the threads!

213
00:17:37,975 --> 00:17:40,561
I discovered that way ahead of you.

214
00:17:41,395 --> 00:17:42,688
Where are the enemies?

215
00:17:42,896 --> 00:17:44,606
Where is the demon
who's controlling the threads?

216
00:17:47,401 --> 00:17:48,443
What is that?

217
00:17:48,443 --> 00:17:50,070
That was such a pungent foul smell,

218
00:17:50,112 --> 00:17:51,321
even though it was just
for a moment.

219
00:17:55,158 --> 00:17:56,243
This is...

220
00:18:05,878 --> 00:18:06,879
Spiders!

221
00:18:07,212 --> 00:18:09,590
The threads controlling the humans
are connected to the spiders.

222
00:18:10,132 --> 00:18:11,425
That means...

223
00:18:20,058 --> 00:18:23,228
Come here, my cute puppets.

224
00:18:23,437 --> 00:18:26,190
Dance crazily
until your hands and feet break.

225
00:18:27,024 --> 00:18:28,817
Simply cutting off the threads
is no use.

226
00:18:28,942 --> 00:18:31,028
The spiders will just connect
the manipulating threads again.

227
00:18:31,403 --> 00:18:32,446
So...

228
00:18:33,405 --> 00:18:34,781
It's that sharp, foul smell again.

229
00:18:35,032 --> 00:18:36,241
What exactly is that?

230
00:18:36,408 --> 00:18:38,202
It drifted here with the wind.

231
00:18:42,372 --> 00:18:45,918
So we just need to kill
all the spiders then, right?

232
00:18:46,126 --> 00:18:47,169
That's impossible.

233
00:18:47,211 --> 00:18:48,420
The spiders are so small.

234
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:50,047
There are probably
a large number of them.

235
00:18:50,255 --> 00:18:52,758
We must find the demon
who's controlling these spiders.

236
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:59,223
That's not going to work, Inosuke.

237
00:18:59,264 --> 00:19:00,349
Inosuke.

238
00:19:00,349 --> 00:19:04,603
If you have some way of finding
the demon's precise location,

239
00:19:04,645 --> 00:19:05,979
then help me!

240
00:19:06,271 --> 00:19:08,607
A strange scent
just drifted by just now.

241
00:19:08,649 --> 00:19:10,692
My sense of smell
isn't as sensitive anymore.

242
00:19:11,527 --> 00:19:13,612
And you...

243
00:19:13,654 --> 00:19:14,738
My name is Murata!

244
00:19:14,738 --> 00:19:15,781
Mr. Murata!

245
00:19:16,198 --> 00:19:19,785
You and I will find a way to save
those who are being controlled.

246
00:19:19,993 --> 00:19:21,161
Inosuke, you...

247
00:19:35,676 --> 00:19:39,471
Don't disrupt the peaceful lives
of our family.

248
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:43,851
How is he floating in the air?

249
00:19:44,142 --> 00:19:46,687
No, he's standing on a thread.

250
00:19:47,145 --> 00:19:48,397
This family is...

251
00:19:49,273 --> 00:19:52,526
My mother will kill you all soon.

252
00:19:53,944 --> 00:19:55,028
"Mother"?

253
00:20:06,206 --> 00:20:07,583
Darn it!

254
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,543
Where are you going?

255
00:20:09,543 --> 00:20:10,878
Fight me!

256
00:20:11,253 --> 00:20:12,337
Inosuke!

257
00:20:13,297 --> 00:20:15,299
What was that guy here for?

258
00:20:15,507 --> 00:20:18,594
He probably isn't the demon
who's controlling the threads,

259
00:20:18,594 --> 00:20:20,679
so you should probably...

260
00:20:20,679 --> 00:20:23,849
All right, I know!

261
00:20:24,683 --> 00:20:27,144
We need to find the location
of the demon, right?

262
00:20:27,311 --> 00:20:29,104
You're so annoying, board forehead!

263
00:20:33,025 --> 00:20:34,776
Beast Breathing.

264
00:20:34,818 --> 00:20:36,195
Seventh Fang.

265
00:20:36,403 --> 00:20:38,614
Spatial Awareness.

266
00:21:06,433 --> 00:21:07,893
I found her.

267
00:21:07,893 --> 00:21:09,186
So, you're here.

268
00:21:15,859 --> 00:21:18,028
I won't let anyone disturb us.

269
00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:23,450
Our family of five
is living so happily.

270
00:21:24,451 --> 00:21:28,455
No one can cut the bond between us.

271
00:23:00,088 --> 00:23:01,089
(Demon Slayer)

272
00:23:03,217 --> 00:23:04,593
Nezuko!

273
00:23:04,593 --> 00:23:05,886
Tanjiro!

274
00:23:06,011 --> 00:23:07,429
Are you guys there?

275
00:23:07,429 --> 00:23:09,097
(Calm down and listen closely
to your surroundings!)

276
00:23:09,139 --> 00:23:10,516
Nezuko is in danger.

277
00:23:10,516 --> 00:23:12,518
Chuntaro, be quiet
and help me find them.

278
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:13,894
(So, that's why you should
calm down first!)

279
00:23:13,894 --> 00:23:16,355
(Now, let me tell you
a Taisho secret!)

280
00:23:16,396 --> 00:23:18,565
(My real name is Ukogi.)

281
00:23:18,607 --> 00:23:20,859
(I love eating rice.)

282
00:23:20,859 --> 00:23:22,903
(But Zenitsu doesn't know it,
so he keeps feeding me beans.)

283
00:23:22,903 --> 00:23:24,488
What are you so angry about?

284
00:23:24,488 --> 00:23:25,948
Have some of this and cool down.

285
00:23:25,948 --> 00:23:27,199
(It's an "ukogi" rice ball!)

286
00:23:27,199 --> 00:23:28,700
After you finish eating,
hurry and help me find them.

287
00:23:28,742 --> 00:23:30,285
Nezuko is in danger.

288
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:33,038
Nezuko!

289
00:23:33,038 --> 00:23:34,206
(This is exactly why
I can't bring myself to hate him.)

290
00:23:34,206 --> 00:23:37,709
Next, Episode 16,
"Letting Someone Else Go First".

291
00:23:37,709 --> 00:23:39,378
(To be continued)
