1
00:00:01,835 --> 00:00:03,170
Here I come.

2
00:00:03,337 --> 00:00:06,423
Boar incoming!

3
00:00:07,549 --> 00:00:08,967
I'm angry.

4
00:00:08,967 --> 00:00:10,552
I'm furious.

5
00:00:15,766 --> 00:00:16,850
Teruko!

6
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:18,060
Grab onto the furniture!

7
00:00:20,062 --> 00:00:21,813
This guy is a mutated demon!

8
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:24,358
Don't just swing your sword
around recklessly!

9
00:00:38,997 --> 00:00:43,210
(Demon Slayer)

10
00:02:00,287 --> 00:02:03,040
(Episode 12: The Boar
Bares its Fangs, Zenitsu Sleeps)

11
00:02:07,628 --> 00:02:09,338
I'm angry.

12
00:02:09,421 --> 00:02:12,466
You stupid insects
are causing trouble in my home!

13
00:02:26,605 --> 00:02:28,524
The room spins in circles?

14
00:02:28,524 --> 00:02:29,983
Interesting.

15
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:31,985
Very interesting.

16
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:37,908
Don't step on people!

17
00:02:40,911 --> 00:02:42,913
What are you doing?

18
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,457
What are you doing...

19
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:47,000
stepping on such a small kid
like that?

20
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:51,129
Very nice!

21
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:55,300
This is the first time
someone has knocked me away.

22
00:02:56,969 --> 00:02:58,762
Why is he fighting me?

23
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:00,681
Is he not part of
the Demon Slayer Corps?

24
00:03:01,223 --> 00:03:03,600
My swords are remarkable.

25
00:03:03,809 --> 00:03:07,271
They're not something
you're fit to use!

26
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:10,399
The sharpness of these swords
that could cut you into pieces...

27
00:03:10,399 --> 00:03:12,067
is what I'm most proud of.

28
00:03:12,276 --> 00:03:13,277
Stop!

29
00:03:13,277 --> 00:03:14,862
There's a demon right over there!

30
00:03:15,404 --> 00:03:16,446
I don't care!

31
00:03:17,823 --> 00:03:19,157
Stupid insects.

32
00:03:19,241 --> 00:03:20,617
Get out of my sight!

33
00:03:20,659 --> 00:03:21,785
Die!

34
00:03:25,956 --> 00:03:27,958
The tatami flooring
suddenly split open.

35
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:30,586
It split at the same speed
as the drumming.

36
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:33,547
The shape of these are like
the claw marks of a beast.

37
00:03:37,801 --> 00:03:39,094
To the right!

38
00:03:40,804 --> 00:03:42,181
To the left!

39
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:43,891
Stupid insects.

40
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:46,351
These bloody insects!

41
00:03:51,607 --> 00:03:53,442
I'm getting the hang of it now.

42
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:01,658
The room changed again.

43
00:04:02,201 --> 00:04:03,952
But why is that?

44
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:06,914
The demon didn't strike
the drum just now.

45
00:04:07,748 --> 00:04:11,084
I can smell the scent of
several demons in this house.

46
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:13,795
Could there be other demons
who have drums?

47
00:04:14,922 --> 00:04:16,465
So, that's why the room...

48
00:04:19,218 --> 00:04:20,552
It's the smell of blood.

49
00:04:22,471 --> 00:04:23,847
Don't be scared.

50
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:26,099
Follow right behind me, okay?

51
00:04:35,734 --> 00:04:38,237
It's another body
that has been devoured by demons.

52
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:41,406
Is something wrong?

53
00:04:42,032 --> 00:04:43,200
It's nothing.

54
00:04:43,367 --> 00:04:44,868
The demon isn't here anymore.

55
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:47,037
Come, let's go to the other side.

56
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:52,042
Don't look back
and just keep going straight.

57
00:04:55,963 --> 00:04:57,881
There's another scent
that's different from that corpse.

58
00:04:58,507 --> 00:05:01,885
It's a unique blood scent
that I've never smelled before.

59
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:05,055
It smells like
there isn't a lot of bleeding.

60
00:05:35,961 --> 00:05:38,005
Excuse me, Zenitsu.

61
00:05:45,095 --> 00:05:47,181
A signal...

62
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:50,017
You could've at least
given me a signal!

63
00:05:50,017 --> 00:05:51,351
If there's something
you want to tell me,

64
00:05:51,393 --> 00:05:52,728
don't be so spontaneous, all right?

65
00:05:52,728 --> 00:05:56,440
My heart almost jumped
out of my mouth!

66
00:05:57,524 --> 00:05:58,692
Sorry.

67
00:05:58,901 --> 00:06:00,986
If my heart really jumped out,

68
00:06:00,986 --> 00:06:04,740
that would make you a murderer,
do you know that?

69
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:06,533
I just wanted to say...

70
00:06:06,909 --> 00:06:07,951
you're sweating a lot,

71
00:06:07,951 --> 00:06:09,036
your breathing is unstable,

72
00:06:09,036 --> 00:06:10,120
and you're shaking like crazy.

73
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,121
Is that a problem?

74
00:06:11,163 --> 00:06:13,790
I'm already trying my best!

75
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:17,002
No. I feel bad for saying this,

76
00:06:17,211 --> 00:06:19,588
but you're making me anxious too.

77
00:06:19,588 --> 00:06:21,840
Gosh! I'm sorry!

78
00:06:22,132 --> 00:06:23,884
But...

79
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:26,094
If we keep talking like this,

80
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:29,264
the demons might discover us,

81
00:06:29,431 --> 00:06:33,519
so I think we better try
to keep quiet.

82
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:34,895
What do you think?

83
00:06:42,986 --> 00:06:44,446
There's a kid...

84
00:06:44,446 --> 00:06:46,823
He looks tasty!

85
00:06:47,866 --> 00:06:49,493
See!

86
00:06:49,535 --> 00:06:50,619
He appeared!

87
00:06:50,619 --> 00:06:52,538
A demon appeared!

88
00:07:03,257 --> 00:07:04,633
Don't follow us!

89
00:07:04,633 --> 00:07:06,009
Please don't follow us!

90
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:08,387
Don't come after us!

91
00:07:11,098 --> 00:07:12,933
I don't taste good!

92
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:14,643
I probably taste really disgusting!

93
00:07:14,643 --> 00:07:15,644
I'm serious!

94
00:07:15,644 --> 00:07:17,980
This kid is all skin and bones
and he's so dry and shriveled!

95
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:20,315
He won't taste pleasant at all!

96
00:07:21,984 --> 00:07:25,153
How would I know
if I don't give it a taste?

97
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:29,199
What is that?

98
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:30,325
His tongue is so quick!

99
00:07:30,325 --> 00:07:31,785
The water jar split in half
instantly!

100
00:07:33,829 --> 00:07:35,998
This is ridiculous!

101
00:07:40,002 --> 00:07:42,045
Zenitsu! Hurry and get up!

102
00:07:42,921 --> 00:07:44,047
I can't move my knees.

103
00:07:44,047 --> 00:07:46,550
Eighty percent of my fear
is concentrated in my knees now!

104
00:07:46,675 --> 00:07:49,303
This is not the time
to say stuff like this!

105
00:07:49,511 --> 00:07:52,431
Just leave me!

106
00:07:52,598 --> 00:07:54,224
Hurry up and save yourself!

107
00:07:54,266 --> 00:07:56,226
I can't bring myself to do that!

108
00:07:57,644 --> 00:07:59,646
How can there be
such a good kid like him?

109
00:07:59,688 --> 00:08:02,357
I can tell from his voice,
he's clearly terrified.

110
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:05,235
I have to think of a way!

111
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:07,196
If I don't protect him,

112
00:08:07,196 --> 00:08:08,864
it'll be so sad!

113
00:08:08,864 --> 00:08:10,199
Dying before even hitting
double-digits...

114
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,825
would be so unfair!

115
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:14,161
But I'm really too weak!

116
00:08:14,161 --> 00:08:15,204
Get up!

117
00:08:15,204 --> 00:08:17,456
I don't have the strength
to protect him,

118
00:08:17,956 --> 00:08:20,417
but I have to do it!

119
00:08:23,212 --> 00:08:28,342
I'm going to suck out
your bone marrow through your ears!

120
00:08:32,888 --> 00:08:34,306
Zenitsu!

121
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:36,099
Zenitsu...

122
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:42,356
He fell asleep.

123
00:08:45,234 --> 00:08:47,110
What's wrong with this guy?

124
00:08:59,748 --> 00:09:01,041
Die!

125
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:03,752
Zenitsu!

126
00:09:03,836 --> 00:09:06,088
Hurry and wake up!

127
00:09:37,494 --> 00:09:38,579
What...

128
00:09:38,579 --> 00:09:40,414
What is that sound?

129
00:09:40,539 --> 00:09:44,126
This guy's breathing changed.

130
00:09:45,169 --> 00:09:46,587
Zenitsu...

131
00:09:50,257 --> 00:09:51,842
Thunder Breathing.

132
00:09:51,884 --> 00:09:53,177
First Form.

133
00:09:53,635 --> 00:09:55,095
Thunderclap and Flash!

134
00:10:15,741 --> 00:10:17,367
The demon is dead?

135
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:19,411
The demon just suddenly died!

136
00:10:19,411 --> 00:10:20,454
What happened?

137
00:10:20,537 --> 00:10:21,830
I've had enough of this!

138
00:10:22,039 --> 00:10:23,874
What is this? What happened?

139
00:10:23,874 --> 00:10:24,958
I can't stand this anymore!

140
00:10:28,003 --> 00:10:29,546
Shoichi...

141
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:31,298
Was it you?

142
00:10:32,758 --> 00:10:35,344
Thank you! I've finally been saved!

143
00:10:35,344 --> 00:10:38,180
I won't forget
your huge act of kindness!

144
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:39,431
You should've told me
right from the start...

145
00:10:39,473 --> 00:10:41,683
that you're this good!

146
00:10:44,394 --> 00:10:45,938
What's going on?

147
00:10:47,564 --> 00:10:48,732
What did you say?

148
00:10:50,192 --> 00:10:51,318
Nothing.

149
00:10:54,363 --> 00:10:55,656
It's nothing.

150
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:57,491
Let's go.

151
00:11:01,078 --> 00:11:02,913
I got knocked away again!

152
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:05,374
This has been happening
since three days ago!

153
00:11:05,374 --> 00:11:06,500
Darn it!

154
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:10,087
I'm no good at navigating...

155
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:12,840
such narrow buildings like this!

156
00:11:21,223 --> 00:11:22,850
I can't believe you were able
to dodge that.

157
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:25,644
What an energetic human being.

158
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:28,939
It seems it'll be worthwhile...

159
00:11:28,981 --> 00:11:30,941
scraping out every bit
of your flesh.

160
00:11:36,238 --> 00:11:38,866
Self-created Beast Breathing.

161
00:11:39,408 --> 00:11:41,201
The bigger the target,

162
00:11:41,243 --> 00:11:43,412
the more worthwhile
to slice him in half!

163
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:46,790
You're charging at me head-on,
are you?

164
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:48,333
You have a lot of guts!

165
00:11:50,961 --> 00:11:53,505
That's painful!

166
00:11:53,881 --> 00:11:57,968
I'll use your corpse
as my stepping stone!

167
00:11:58,594 --> 00:12:01,513
Third Fang Devour!

168
00:12:09,021 --> 00:12:12,399
Boar incoming!

169
00:12:16,528 --> 00:12:17,863
Rare blood...

170
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:19,615
Rare blood...

171
00:12:19,948 --> 00:12:21,867
As long as I consume
some rare blood,

172
00:12:22,659 --> 00:12:24,203
my power will increase by 50...

173
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:26,997
No, it's the power of 100 humans!

174
00:12:28,165 --> 00:12:32,085
I have to find and devour
more humans with a rare blood!

175
00:12:32,336 --> 00:12:33,754
That way,

176
00:12:34,588 --> 00:12:37,925
I'll be able to return to my place
among the Twelve Demon Moons!

177
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,895
Kyogai.

178
00:12:52,231 --> 00:12:54,191
Are you not able
to eat humans anymore?

179
00:12:54,942 --> 00:12:56,860
Is that all you can do?

180
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,237
No!

181
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:00,072
No, I'm not done yet!

182
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,745
Please wait!

183
00:13:06,954 --> 00:13:08,664
If I had a bit more time...

184
00:13:08,705 --> 00:13:09,998
Enough.

185
00:13:10,415 --> 00:13:12,709
I'm stripping you of your number...

186
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:15,963
because you've reached your limit.

187
00:13:17,631 --> 00:13:20,759
The more humans you eat,
the stronger your power.

188
00:13:21,051 --> 00:13:23,679
If your potential is recognized,

189
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:26,765
you'll earn Lord Kibutsuji's blood.

190
00:13:27,975 --> 00:13:31,478
The power of his blood
is absolutely out of the ordinary.

191
00:13:32,062 --> 00:13:33,647
No matter how much stronger I get,

192
00:13:33,689 --> 00:13:36,567
I would never be able
to compare to Lord Kibutsuji.

193
00:13:36,859 --> 00:13:39,403
To be recognized as a part of
the Twelve Demon Moons,

194
00:13:40,028 --> 00:13:42,531
I must continue to devour humans.

195
00:13:42,531 --> 00:13:46,368
I believed I could continue
to grow stronger.

196
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,872
That was what I once believed.

197
00:13:51,582 --> 00:13:52,833
Kiyoshi!

198
00:13:55,544 --> 00:13:58,130
Kiyoshi!

199
00:13:59,006 --> 00:14:00,257
Teruko!

200
00:14:02,551 --> 00:14:03,927
Who is he?

201
00:14:04,678 --> 00:14:06,430
My name is Kamado Tanjiro.

202
00:14:07,097 --> 00:14:08,932
I'm here to defeat evil demons.

203
00:14:10,726 --> 00:14:12,519
Here, let me see your injury.

204
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:14,897
You did really well by yourself.

205
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:19,359
Kiyoshi!

206
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,576
My ointment here is really amazing!

207
00:14:27,784 --> 00:14:30,287
My master gave it to me!

208
00:14:31,705 --> 00:14:34,917
My master always wears a tengu mask.

209
00:14:35,209 --> 00:14:37,336
Tengu? Really?

210
00:14:37,461 --> 00:14:38,504
It's true.

211
00:14:38,921 --> 00:14:41,131
His ointment is really good.

212
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:43,133
It takes effect immediately!

213
00:14:44,718 --> 00:14:46,053
All done.

214
00:14:47,012 --> 00:14:48,096
How do you feel?

215
00:14:48,096 --> 00:14:49,348
It doesn't hurt anymore, right?

216
00:14:52,643 --> 00:14:54,019
Can you tell me...

217
00:14:54,144 --> 00:14:55,270
what you encountered here?

218
00:14:59,274 --> 00:15:01,068
I was captured by a monster.

219
00:15:03,028 --> 00:15:04,446
When I was about to get eaten,

220
00:15:06,448 --> 00:15:10,369
another monster came out of nowhere,

221
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:13,413
and they started going
for each other's throats...

222
00:15:14,498 --> 00:15:18,836
They were fighting
over who gets to eat me.

223
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:25,008
Then, the demon with drums
growing out of his body...

224
00:15:25,884 --> 00:15:28,345
was attacked by the other demon,

225
00:15:28,762 --> 00:15:30,597
and this drum fell off his body.

226
00:15:31,932 --> 00:15:33,600
After I picked it up and struck it,

227
00:15:33,976 --> 00:15:35,394
the room changed.

228
00:15:36,311 --> 00:15:38,021
I managed to survive until now.

229
00:15:40,941 --> 00:15:43,110
The demon with drums
growing out of his body...

230
00:15:43,402 --> 00:15:44,528
Was it that demon?

231
00:15:45,362 --> 00:15:47,281
Did he say something...

232
00:15:47,823 --> 00:15:49,199
about rare blood?

233
00:15:50,617 --> 00:15:52,202
That's right!

234
00:15:52,619 --> 00:15:54,705
He called me "rare blood"!

235
00:15:56,915 --> 00:15:58,458
A rare bloodline is
what they refer to as...

236
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:01,461
people with rare and valuable blood.

237
00:16:05,048 --> 00:16:06,592
You brats,

238
00:16:06,592 --> 00:16:08,385
watch me peck your brains out.

239
00:16:08,385 --> 00:16:09,636
Don't be so mean!

240
00:16:10,429 --> 00:16:13,015
What does rare blood mean?

241
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:16,727
The blood of all living organisms
are classified into different types,

242
00:16:16,727 --> 00:16:17,728
you idiot!

243
00:16:17,728 --> 00:16:19,479
Within rare bloodlines,

244
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:21,565
there is a small number
of people with valuable blood.

245
00:16:21,565 --> 00:16:24,193
The more of that you consume,
the more powerful you become.

246
00:16:24,359 --> 00:16:25,485
For demons,

247
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:26,904
eating a human with rare blood...

248
00:16:26,904 --> 00:16:28,447
is equivalent to
the nutritional value...

249
00:16:28,447 --> 00:16:33,160
of devouring 50 humans, or even 100.

250
00:16:34,119 --> 00:16:36,914
Humans with rare blood
are like delicacies to demons.

251
00:16:36,914 --> 00:16:39,124
They're a demon's favorite.

252
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:49,843
Rare blood...

253
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:51,637
Rare blood...

254
00:16:53,972 --> 00:16:55,557
I'm going to leave this room.

255
00:16:56,725 --> 00:16:57,851
Calm down.

256
00:16:57,851 --> 00:16:58,977
Everything will be okay.

257
00:16:59,436 --> 00:17:01,355
I'm going to defeat the demon.

258
00:17:02,981 --> 00:17:04,316
Listen up, Teruko.

259
00:17:05,734 --> 00:17:08,195
Your brother is exhausted now,

260
00:17:08,195 --> 00:17:10,113
so you have to help him.

261
00:17:11,865 --> 00:17:13,325
Once I leave this room,

262
00:17:13,408 --> 00:17:15,369
you must immediately strike the drum
and shift to another room,

263
00:17:15,911 --> 00:17:17,955
just like what your brother
did before.

264
00:17:18,205 --> 00:17:20,040
No matter who opens the door...

265
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,583
or if you hear any noise at all,

266
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:22,668
just strike the drum...

267
00:17:22,668 --> 00:17:24,253
and save yourselves
without hesitation.

268
00:17:25,045 --> 00:17:27,172
I'll definitely come back for you.

269
00:17:27,673 --> 00:17:29,466
I will follow your scents.

270
00:17:30,092 --> 00:17:32,553
I'll call your names
before I open the door.

271
00:17:36,014 --> 00:17:37,850
It'll all be okay
if we just work a little harder.

272
00:17:38,725 --> 00:17:39,935
Can you guys do it?

273
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:44,106
Awesome!

274
00:17:44,106 --> 00:17:45,190
You are so strong.

275
00:17:48,193 --> 00:17:49,319
I'll be back soon.

276
00:17:57,995 --> 00:17:58,996
Hit the drum now!

277
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:03,125
Stupid insects!

278
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:05,335
You disgust me.

279
00:18:22,186 --> 00:18:24,521
The drum on his left shoulder
spins the room right.

280
00:18:26,356 --> 00:18:28,108
The drum on the right shoulder
spins the room left.

281
00:18:29,151 --> 00:18:30,819
The drum on the right leg
spins it forward.

282
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:33,655
The drum on the left leg
spins it backward.

283
00:18:35,324 --> 00:18:38,076
The drum on the stomach
is the claw attack.

284
00:18:54,092 --> 00:18:55,177
He's so fast!

285
00:18:55,177 --> 00:18:58,096
The speed of the spins and attacks
are unbelievably fast.

286
00:18:59,223 --> 00:19:01,808
Although Lady Tamayo
helped treat my wounds,

287
00:19:01,934 --> 00:19:03,727
they haven't completely healed yet.

288
00:19:05,437 --> 00:19:07,856
Will I be able to defeat him?

289
00:19:08,774 --> 00:19:10,025
My wounds really hurt.

290
00:19:10,108 --> 00:19:12,694
They hurt so much
I can barely stand it anymore!

291
00:19:14,488 --> 00:19:17,699
I've been enduring it
this whole time.

292
00:19:17,991 --> 00:19:21,036
When I pulled the girl away
from Zenitsu...

293
00:19:21,787 --> 00:19:23,247
When I yelled out loud...

294
00:19:23,455 --> 00:19:25,624
I desperately tried to endure
the sharp pain.

295
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:28,293
I could bear with it
because I'm the eldest son.

296
00:19:29,336 --> 00:19:31,713
If I were the second son,
I may not be able to handle it.

297
00:19:33,715 --> 00:19:35,259
When I put strength into my leg,

298
00:19:35,509 --> 00:19:37,052
my broken bones screak.

299
00:19:37,344 --> 00:19:38,846
I can't exert any strength at all.

300
00:19:41,265 --> 00:19:45,394
That demon's attack
that leaves claw marks...

301
00:19:46,186 --> 00:19:48,605
I fear that so much
that I can't get close to him.

302
00:19:50,148 --> 00:19:51,900
I'm not in good condition right now.

303
00:19:52,067 --> 00:19:55,153
When I charge forward
to close in on him,

304
00:19:55,153 --> 00:19:57,614
I may not be able to control
my legs if they're in pain.

305
00:20:00,701 --> 00:20:02,411
Then, I'd be sliced into pieces.

306
00:20:04,788 --> 00:20:07,791
Because of my wounds,
I can't help but think negatively.

307
00:20:08,667 --> 00:20:10,002
Master Urokodaki!

308
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:14,673
Water can change into various forms.

309
00:20:15,966 --> 00:20:18,385
Water is rectangular
when it's poured into a box...

310
00:20:18,635 --> 00:20:20,721
and it's circular
when it's in a bottle.

311
00:20:20,721 --> 00:20:21,763
Sometimes,

312
00:20:21,763 --> 00:20:25,267
water can even crush rocks
and flow to many different places.

313
00:20:25,601 --> 00:20:26,727
Yes!

314
00:20:26,727 --> 00:20:27,895
That's right!

315
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:31,148
There are 10 forms of
Water Breathing.

316
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:33,692
It can be used to fight
all kinds of enemies.

317
00:20:34,735 --> 00:20:36,278
Because I'm injured,

318
00:20:36,403 --> 00:20:38,572
I have to make up for it
using my moves.

319
00:20:38,822 --> 00:20:40,574
I can transform into various forms.

320
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,410
The flow of water won't stop!

321
00:20:46,413 --> 00:20:47,581
Right now,

322
00:20:47,748 --> 00:20:50,125
not only are my bones broken,
but I have broken down mentally too.

323
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:54,588
A broken Tanjiro
is so disappointing to see!

324
00:20:54,963 --> 00:20:57,216
All right! Can you be quiet?

325
00:20:58,008 --> 00:20:59,968
I'm going to keep marching forward!

326
00:21:00,511 --> 00:21:02,346
I'll cheer myself on!

327
00:21:03,555 --> 00:21:05,307
You can do it, Tanjiro!

328
00:21:06,099 --> 00:21:07,476
You can do it!

329
00:21:11,688 --> 00:21:13,815
I've done well so far.

330
00:21:14,274 --> 00:21:15,859
I'm a capable person!

331
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:18,153
It's the same today...

332
00:21:18,737 --> 00:21:20,239
and also in the future!

333
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,157
No matter how many hardships I face,

334
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:28,330
I would never feel discouraged!

335
00:23:00,005 --> 00:23:01,048
(Demon Slayer)

336
00:23:03,175 --> 00:23:04,301
You can do it, Tanjiro!

337
00:23:04,301 --> 00:23:05,344
You can do it!

338
00:23:06,178 --> 00:23:08,514
I could bear with it
because I'm the eldest son.

339
00:23:09,181 --> 00:23:11,058
Nezuko, you're also
cheering for me, right?

340
00:23:11,141 --> 00:23:12,351
Thank you, Nezuko.

341
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:14,102
I'll return the favor.

342
00:23:14,102 --> 00:23:15,812
Let me cheer for you too!

343
00:23:15,854 --> 00:23:16,855
You can do it, Nezuko!

344
00:23:16,855 --> 00:23:17,856
You can do it!

345
00:23:18,815 --> 00:23:21,485
Nezuko definitely
won't get discouraged!

346
00:23:22,194 --> 00:23:23,487
You're the eldest daughter!

347
00:23:23,487 --> 00:23:25,447
But if you ever run into
any hardships,

348
00:23:25,447 --> 00:23:26,865
don't just endure it and tell me!

349
00:23:28,325 --> 00:23:29,868
Next, Episode 13,

350
00:23:29,868 --> 00:23:31,703
"Something More Important
than Life".

351
00:23:32,412 --> 00:23:35,624
We've run out of time to talk about
Taisho secrets!

352
00:23:37,209 --> 00:23:39,962
