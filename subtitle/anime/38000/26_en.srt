1
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:08,967
So strong.

2
00:00:08,967 --> 00:00:10,093
That's amazing.

3
00:00:14,765 --> 00:00:15,807
That's enough.

4
00:00:17,768 --> 00:00:19,937
Kanao, you're really fast.

5
00:00:22,397 --> 00:00:24,942
The result for today
is 10 wins and 10 losses.

6
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:26,902
I didn't train enough.

7
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:28,487
I'll go and have a run.

8
00:00:28,737 --> 00:00:29,821
Come with me?

9
00:00:30,364 --> 00:00:32,574
Do we need to maintain the state
of Total Concentration Breathing?

10
00:00:32,783 --> 00:00:33,825
Yes.

11
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:37,871
Do we have to keep this up?

12
00:00:37,955 --> 00:00:39,289
Tanjiro!

13
00:00:42,167 --> 00:00:44,002
You buff idiot.

14
00:00:44,253 --> 00:00:45,337
Let's go.

15
00:00:47,548 --> 00:00:51,969
(Episode 26: New Mission)

16
00:00:51,969 --> 00:00:56,390
(A few months ago)

17
00:00:56,849 --> 00:00:57,891
(Lower Ranks)

18
00:01:03,438 --> 00:01:05,524
What is this place?

19
00:01:18,036 --> 00:01:20,122
Is it that woman's Blood Demon Art?

20
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:24,877
It's like the space is distorted,
centered around that woman.

21
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:47,316
Only the Lower Ranks
of the Twelve Demon Moons...

22
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:49,026
are gathered here.

23
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:51,528
This is my first time
facing this situation.

24
00:01:52,738 --> 00:01:54,698
Lower Rank 5 isn't here yet.

25
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:57,951
The space moved.

26
00:01:57,951 --> 00:01:59,411
It's the effect of Blood Demon Art.

27
00:02:07,419 --> 00:02:09,421
What creature is that woman?

28
00:02:11,715 --> 00:02:12,758
Who is she?

29
00:02:15,093 --> 00:02:17,387
Lower your head and kneel down.

30
00:02:19,014 --> 00:02:20,682
Bow to me.

31
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:27,898
It's Lord Muzan.

32
00:02:28,023 --> 00:02:29,316
It's Lord Muzan's voice.

33
00:02:29,316 --> 00:02:30,484
I didn't even realize.

34
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:34,071
His appearance
and breath totally changed.

35
00:02:34,905 --> 00:02:37,115
It's a perfect camouflage.

36
00:02:38,951 --> 00:02:40,494
I'm so sorry.

37
00:02:40,494 --> 00:02:42,579
Because you look
and smell totally different...

38
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:45,332
Who gave you permission to speak?

39
00:02:45,332 --> 00:02:48,627
Based on your meaningless thinking,
you have no right to speak.

40
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:52,047
Just answer my question.

41
00:02:53,924 --> 00:02:55,926
Rui was killed.

42
00:02:56,885 --> 00:02:58,303
He was Lower Rank 5.

43
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,140
I just want to know one thing.

44
00:03:02,933 --> 00:03:06,812
Why are the demons
of the Lower Ranks so weak?

45
00:03:07,688 --> 00:03:09,857
Even if you're in the ranks
of the Twelve Demon Moons,

46
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:11,483
doesn't mean it's the end.

47
00:03:11,775 --> 00:03:13,694
It's only the beginning for you.

48
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:15,737
You should devour more humans,

49
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:17,322
make your power stronger.

50
00:03:17,364 --> 00:03:20,742
It's the beginning
of your service to me.

51
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:23,537
In the past century,

52
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:27,040
the Upper Ranks of the Twelve
Demon Moons have not changed.

53
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:30,169
Those who killed the Hashiras
of the Demon Slayer Corps...

54
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,504
have always been the demons
from the Upper Ranks.

55
00:03:32,796 --> 00:03:34,882
What's with the Lower Ranks?

56
00:03:34,882 --> 00:03:36,842
Why do I see new faces all the time?

57
00:03:36,842 --> 00:03:39,553
We can't do anything about it.

58
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:42,806
"We can't do anything about it."

59
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:46,310
What's that? Explain.

60
00:03:46,685 --> 00:03:48,896
Can he read my mind?

61
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:50,898
That's bad.

62
00:03:50,898 --> 00:03:52,482
What's so bad?

63
00:03:53,275 --> 00:03:54,651
Explain.

64
00:03:57,196 --> 00:03:58,697
Please forgive me.

65
00:03:58,697 --> 00:03:59,740
Lord Kibutsuji.

66
00:04:00,532 --> 00:04:01,617
I'm begging you.

67
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:04,161
I beg for your mercy.

68
00:04:04,161 --> 00:04:05,454
I'm terribly sorry.

69
00:04:05,454 --> 00:04:07,831
Sorry!

70
00:04:14,046 --> 00:04:16,006
Why is this happening?

71
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,342
Am I going to be killed?

72
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:21,386
I worked so hard to be a part of
the Twelve Demon Moons.

73
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:23,639
Why?

74
00:04:24,473 --> 00:04:27,518
From now on, I'll be more...

75
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:31,188
Are the demon slayers
scarier than me?

76
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:33,565
No!

77
00:04:33,565 --> 00:04:37,611
Every time you see a Hashira
from the Demon Slayer Corps,

78
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:40,197
you'd think of running away, right?

79
00:04:40,197 --> 00:04:41,949
No, that's not what I think!

80
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:45,619
I'll put my life on the line
to fight in your name!

81
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:49,331
Are you refuting what I said?

82
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:00,759
It's no use. It's over.

83
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:03,011
He can read our minds.

84
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:05,389
We'll get killed
no matter what we say.

85
00:05:06,348 --> 00:05:08,559
Even if we fight,
there's no chance of winning.

86
00:05:10,269 --> 00:05:11,270
Then,

87
00:05:14,064 --> 00:05:15,274
the only way is to escape.

88
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:23,156
Such an idiot.

89
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:25,075
I need to find a way to escape.

90
00:05:25,075 --> 00:05:26,243
I can escape.

91
00:05:26,243 --> 00:05:27,619
I've come so far...

92
00:05:27,619 --> 00:05:29,288
(Lower Ranks)

93
00:05:32,082 --> 00:05:33,792
Seems like we only need
the Upper Ranks...

94
00:05:33,792 --> 00:05:36,044
of the Twelve Demon Moons.

95
00:05:36,295 --> 00:05:38,463
The Lower Ranks will be dissolved.

96
00:05:39,298 --> 00:05:40,841
Did I get killed?

97
00:05:41,967 --> 00:05:43,135
How?

98
00:05:43,635 --> 00:05:45,554
Was it the power of the Biwa Demon?

99
00:05:45,554 --> 00:05:48,724
No, I did not hear
the sound of the pipa.

100
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:51,185
Why?

101
00:05:51,393 --> 00:05:53,770
My body can't regenerate.

102
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:12,206
Do you have any final words?

103
00:06:13,832 --> 00:06:15,751
I can still serve you.

104
00:06:15,751 --> 00:06:18,212
If only you'd give me more time,

105
00:06:18,212 --> 00:06:19,755
I'll prove that I'm useful to you.

106
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:22,341
Tell me how much time
do you need exactly?

107
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:25,802
How exactly are you useful to me?

108
00:06:26,261 --> 00:06:30,015
What can you do for me
with your power now?

109
00:06:31,016 --> 00:06:32,226
Blood!

110
00:06:33,143 --> 00:06:35,145
If you can give me
some of your blood,

111
00:06:35,145 --> 00:06:38,190
I will conform to your blood,

112
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:41,068
become a stronger demon
and fight for you!

113
00:06:41,068 --> 00:06:45,531
Why should I listen to you
and give you my blood?

114
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:48,075
You're so shameless.

115
00:06:48,075 --> 00:06:49,910
Who do you think you are?

116
00:06:51,286 --> 00:06:52,371
No!

117
00:06:52,371 --> 00:06:54,164
It's not that! I...

118
00:06:54,623 --> 00:06:55,624
Shut up.

119
00:06:55,624 --> 00:06:57,334
I've got nothing wrong.

120
00:06:58,001 --> 00:07:00,128
I never make mistakes.

121
00:07:00,337 --> 00:07:03,048
The ultimate decisions
are always made by me.

122
00:07:03,048 --> 00:07:05,759
My words are final.

123
00:07:06,718 --> 00:07:08,887
You don't have the right to refuse.

124
00:07:08,887 --> 00:07:12,140
If I say something is right,
it means that it's right.

125
00:07:13,225 --> 00:07:15,853
You dare give me instructions.

126
00:07:16,395 --> 00:07:18,105
You deserve to die.

127
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,739
Do you have any final words?

128
00:07:28,991 --> 00:07:30,993
Even that guy got killed.

129
00:07:32,119 --> 00:07:35,289
Our life or death depends
on the Lord's choice.

130
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:38,208
I'm dead.

131
00:07:40,294 --> 00:07:41,962
You're right.

132
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:48,135
I feel like I had a beautiful dream,

133
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:52,222
ever since I was able
to work for my Lord.

134
00:07:52,723 --> 00:07:56,685
I'm glad I could hear the wailing
of the others before they die.

135
00:07:57,227 --> 00:07:59,646
I'm so fortunate.

136
00:08:00,772 --> 00:08:04,568
I really love to see
others suffering.

137
00:08:04,943 --> 00:08:07,446
It's like having a good dream.

138
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:11,575
Thank you for keeping me
until the end.

139
00:08:28,884 --> 00:08:30,177
I admire you.

140
00:08:30,302 --> 00:08:33,013
I'm giving you my blood.

141
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:35,974
But if you cannot endure
the large amount of blood,

142
00:08:35,974 --> 00:08:37,809
you may die.

143
00:08:37,976 --> 00:08:40,354
However, if you can overcome it,

144
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:42,940
you'll experience great power...

145
00:08:43,565 --> 00:08:46,026
and work for me.

146
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:49,363
Kill the Hashiras
of the Demon Slayer Corps.

147
00:08:51,448 --> 00:08:55,536
If you can kill the demon slayer
with the hanafuda earrings,

148
00:08:55,536 --> 00:08:57,871
I'll give you even more blood.

149
00:09:21,144 --> 00:09:22,229
What's this?

150
00:09:22,396 --> 00:09:23,939
I think I see something.

151
00:09:24,231 --> 00:09:27,818
Lord Muzan's blood is
flowing in my body.

152
00:09:32,197 --> 00:09:34,491
If I can kill the Hashiras
and the boy,

153
00:09:34,491 --> 00:09:36,660
I can get more blood.

154
00:09:36,785 --> 00:09:38,453
It's like a lovely dream.

155
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:45,460
It's morning, wake up!

156
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:47,254
What?

157
00:09:47,421 --> 00:09:49,214
What happened?

158
00:09:49,715 --> 00:09:52,426
There are massive casualties
on the Mugen Train.

159
00:09:52,634 --> 00:09:55,846
More than 40 people are missing.

160
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:59,433
Travel to the place
and meet Rengoku Kyojuro there.

161
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:02,352
Move west now.

162
00:10:11,403 --> 00:10:13,447
The Mugen Train mission,

163
00:10:13,572 --> 00:10:16,158
I sent Tanjiro and the others.

164
00:10:17,201 --> 00:10:21,371
May I hear your reason
for recommending Tanjiro?

165
00:10:22,414 --> 00:10:24,249
Kamado always advances fearlessly...

166
00:10:24,249 --> 00:10:26,710
and work hard to gain experience.

167
00:10:27,294 --> 00:10:28,921
By growing this way,

168
00:10:28,921 --> 00:10:30,589
he'll show us unexpected results.

169
00:10:31,423 --> 00:10:32,758
More importantly,

170
00:10:33,008 --> 00:10:37,554
he's very clear on his goal
to defeat Kibutsuji.

171
00:10:38,472 --> 00:10:41,517
I agree with you on that.

172
00:10:42,392 --> 00:10:43,519
Also,

173
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:48,315
I heard from Kamado
that his dad used Sun Breathing.

174
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:52,110
Based on his current state,

175
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:54,738
I don't deny
that he's not strong enough.

176
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:57,074
I think Mr. Rengoku...

177
00:10:57,157 --> 00:10:59,910
might be able to guide him
to become stronger.

178
00:11:00,744 --> 00:11:01,995
You're right.

179
00:11:02,246 --> 00:11:05,791
From how he has a demon sister
who refuses to eat humans...

180
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:09,711
and how he met Kibutsuji Muzan,

181
00:11:10,337 --> 00:11:14,633
Tanjiro may be a child
born with a special destiny.

182
00:11:16,844 --> 00:11:18,804
Okay, time to go.

183
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:22,850
Someone is coming.

184
00:11:26,812 --> 00:11:29,189
He bumped into me
even after I avoided him.

185
00:11:30,774 --> 00:11:32,609
Wait, that guy...

186
00:11:33,318 --> 00:11:35,195
He was in the Final Selection.

187
00:11:38,824 --> 00:11:41,869
His physique changed so much
in such a short period of time.

188
00:11:42,828 --> 00:11:45,789
But what's that smell?

189
00:11:46,748 --> 00:11:47,916
It has been a while!

190
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:49,501
I'm happy that you're well!

191
00:11:54,423 --> 00:11:55,424
Really?

192
00:11:55,716 --> 00:11:57,050
You're leaving already?

193
00:11:57,593 --> 00:11:58,844
Although not long,

194
00:11:58,844 --> 00:12:01,054
I'm glad I got to know you.

195
00:12:01,597 --> 00:12:02,806
All the best.

196
00:12:03,891 --> 00:12:05,142
Have a safe journey.

197
00:12:05,809 --> 00:12:08,604
You had to take care of us
despite being so busy.

198
00:12:08,604 --> 00:12:09,938
We're really thankful.

199
00:12:09,938 --> 00:12:12,149
Thanks to you, we can fight again.

200
00:12:14,902 --> 00:12:16,528
You don't have to thank me.

201
00:12:17,487 --> 00:12:19,948
I was just lucky I survived
the Final Selection.

202
00:12:20,616 --> 00:12:24,703
After that, I'm just a coward
who can't fight because of my fear.

203
00:12:27,414 --> 00:12:28,957
That's okay.

204
00:12:30,459 --> 00:12:32,753
That's because Ms. Aoi
who saved me...

205
00:12:32,961 --> 00:12:34,630
has become a part of me.

206
00:12:35,005 --> 00:12:38,509
I will bring your determination
into the battlefield.

207
00:12:40,636 --> 00:12:43,388
We'll be back if we get injured.
Goodbye.

208
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:53,357
Found you!

209
00:12:54,691 --> 00:12:55,859
Kanao!

210
00:12:56,235 --> 00:12:57,861
We're departing soon.

211
00:12:57,903 --> 00:12:59,321
Thank you very much.

212
00:13:05,619 --> 00:13:06,703
What?

213
00:13:16,755 --> 00:13:19,424
I was just following
Master's instructions.

214
00:13:20,092 --> 00:13:22,469
I don't deserve your gratitude.

215
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:24,096
Goodbye.

216
00:13:24,888 --> 00:13:26,557
She talked to me!

217
00:13:26,974 --> 00:13:28,392
What did you toss just now?

218
00:13:28,892 --> 00:13:29,977
Goodbye.

219
00:13:29,977 --> 00:13:31,019
Was it a coin?

220
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:32,771
It has a head and a tail, right?

221
00:13:32,771 --> 00:13:34,147
Why did you toss it?

222
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:35,232
Goodbye.

223
00:13:35,232 --> 00:13:37,192
It spins like that?

224
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:41,071
I flip the coin to make decisions
when I don't get any instructions.

225
00:13:41,655 --> 00:13:44,491
The decision just now was
whether I should talk to you.

226
00:13:44,783 --> 00:13:47,911
Heads for not talking
and tails for talking.

227
00:13:48,495 --> 00:13:50,122
I talked to you because I got tails.

228
00:13:51,415 --> 00:13:52,457
Goodbye.

229
00:13:53,417 --> 00:13:55,294
Why don't you decide for yourself?

230
00:13:55,836 --> 00:13:57,671
What were your thoughts, Kanao?

231
00:13:58,380 --> 00:13:59,715
I'm fine with anything.

232
00:14:00,132 --> 00:14:01,800
Because I'm fine with anything,

233
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,343
I can't make any decisions.

234
00:14:04,052 --> 00:14:06,889
I don't think you can just be fine
with everything in this world.

235
00:14:08,432 --> 00:14:12,603
It must be because the voice
in your heart is too gentle.

236
00:14:15,439 --> 00:14:18,358
But it's important
to follow instructions too.

237
00:14:20,986 --> 00:14:22,487
Can I borrow that?

238
00:14:24,907 --> 00:14:26,158
Thank you.

239
00:14:28,952 --> 00:14:31,205
Okay, I'll toss the coin to decide.

240
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:32,831
Decide what?

241
00:14:33,207 --> 00:14:34,625
To decide that from now on,

242
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:38,545
you have to follow your heart!

243
00:14:43,217 --> 00:14:44,927
It's too high!

244
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:46,011
Heads.

245
00:14:46,011 --> 00:14:47,262
Please let it be heads.

246
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:49,139
If it's heads,

247
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:50,974
you have to follow your heart
from now on.

248
00:14:52,851 --> 00:14:54,520
Hey, it's so weird.

249
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:55,687
Where did it go?

250
00:14:55,687 --> 00:14:57,272
What?

251
00:14:57,314 --> 00:14:58,857
Is that it?

252
00:15:01,652 --> 00:15:03,111
I caught it!

253
00:15:03,111 --> 00:15:04,196
Kanao!

254
00:15:08,033 --> 00:15:09,201
Look here, Kanao.

255
00:15:10,869 --> 00:15:12,162
Which side is it?

256
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:13,580
When the coin fell,

257
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:15,207
his back blocked my vision.

258
00:15:19,086 --> 00:15:21,088
It's heads!

259
00:15:21,922 --> 00:15:22,965
Kanao.

260
00:15:26,844 --> 00:15:27,886
All the best.

261
00:15:28,053 --> 00:15:30,222
The heart is
the driving force of humans.

262
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:32,808
Your heart will get stronger.

263
00:15:35,477 --> 00:15:37,354
See you later.

264
00:15:38,772 --> 00:15:39,857
Wait.

265
00:15:39,857 --> 00:15:41,567
How did you get heads?

266
00:15:44,278 --> 00:15:46,154
I saw him toss the coin.

267
00:15:46,655 --> 00:15:48,782
He did not do anything funny.

268
00:15:50,409 --> 00:15:51,535
It's a coincidence.

269
00:15:51,869 --> 00:15:53,912
Anyway, even if I get tails,

270
00:15:53,912 --> 00:15:57,207
I have planned to keep throwing it
until I get heads.

271
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,339
Take care!

272
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:21,773
- You can do it!
- You can do it!

273
00:16:25,861 --> 00:16:27,362
- Awesome!
- Awesome!

274
00:16:27,738 --> 00:16:28,947
Please eat.

275
00:16:28,989 --> 00:16:30,365
Thank you.

276
00:16:30,365 --> 00:16:31,700
Not now!

277
00:16:32,367 --> 00:16:34,870
- Please defeat a lot of demons.
- Please defeat a lot of demons.

278
00:16:35,162 --> 00:16:36,371
I will work hard.

279
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:38,582
I told you not to eat it now!

280
00:16:38,582 --> 00:16:39,666
Shut up.

281
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:41,251
You shut up!

282
00:16:41,585 --> 00:16:42,961
Mr. Tomioka!

283
00:16:44,379 --> 00:16:45,839
Are you leaving for duty now?

284
00:16:46,465 --> 00:16:47,508
Yes.

285
00:16:47,966 --> 00:16:51,553
Seems like you've mastered
Total Concentration Breathing.

286
00:16:51,845 --> 00:16:52,846
Yes.

287
00:16:53,388 --> 00:16:54,681
You have to keep this up.

288
00:16:55,516 --> 00:16:56,517
Yes.

289
00:16:57,476 --> 00:16:58,685
Mr. Tomioka...

290
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:01,104
About Nezuko,

291
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:02,648
I really appreciate your help.

292
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:05,776
You risked your life for us.

293
00:17:06,235 --> 00:17:07,569
I didn't know back then.

294
00:17:08,111 --> 00:17:09,905
How can I express my gratitude?

295
00:17:11,198 --> 00:17:13,742
You can thank me by working hard.

296
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:17,829
Our job as demon slayers
is to kill demons.

297
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,122
That's all.

298
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:21,375
Yes.

299
00:17:23,836 --> 00:17:25,712
Please take care.

300
00:17:26,004 --> 00:17:29,299
You must feel sad
to be separated from me.

301
00:17:29,299 --> 00:17:31,385
I don't mind staying if you want.

302
00:17:31,677 --> 00:17:35,013
Zenitsu, remember to be cautious...

303
00:17:35,055 --> 00:17:38,016
when you're dealing with girls.

304
00:17:38,016 --> 00:17:39,101
Yes.

305
00:17:39,226 --> 00:17:40,936
I'm feeling light as a feather.

306
00:17:40,936 --> 00:17:44,022
But you must feel a little sad
that I'm leaving, right?

307
00:17:44,064 --> 00:17:45,816
- We're not sad at all.
- We're not sad at all.

308
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,443
Okay, everyone.

309
00:17:49,862 --> 00:17:50,988
We're leaving.

310
00:18:01,498 --> 00:18:03,458
This...

311
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,961
What creature is this?

312
00:18:06,378 --> 00:18:07,880
This must be it.

313
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,464
The master of this land.

314
00:18:09,464 --> 00:18:11,592
The master who rules this land.

315
00:18:12,342 --> 00:18:14,553
This length and this kind
of oppression,

316
00:18:14,553 --> 00:18:16,054
I can't be wrong.

317
00:18:16,221 --> 00:18:17,931
Seems like it's asleep now.

318
00:18:17,931 --> 00:18:19,183
We can't let our guard down.

319
00:18:19,474 --> 00:18:20,642
It's a train.

320
00:18:20,642 --> 00:18:21,768
Haven't you seen one?

321
00:18:21,768 --> 00:18:23,645
Keep quiet.

322
00:18:23,645 --> 00:18:26,398
I'll attack first.

323
00:18:26,398 --> 00:18:27,816
Wait, Inosuke!

324
00:18:28,859 --> 00:18:31,278
You said it might be the deity
protecting this land, right?

325
00:18:31,737 --> 00:18:34,323
I don't think it's right
to attack it suddenly.

326
00:18:34,323 --> 00:18:36,783
No. I told you it's a train.

327
00:18:37,075 --> 00:18:38,952
Train. Understand?

328
00:18:38,952 --> 00:18:41,079
It's a means of transportation.

329
00:18:41,455 --> 00:18:42,956
You country bumpkin.

330
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:44,583
Train?

331
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:46,793
Is this what the crow told us?

332
00:18:50,422 --> 00:18:51,798
What's wrong with that guy?

333
00:18:54,593 --> 00:18:56,970
Boar incoming!

334
00:18:57,304 --> 00:18:58,972
Stop it! It's embarrassing!

335
00:19:00,432 --> 00:19:02,142
What are you doing?

336
00:19:03,936 --> 00:19:05,729
They have swords with them.

337
00:19:05,729 --> 00:19:06,730
Call the police!

338
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:08,398
Quick, call the police!

339
00:19:08,649 --> 00:19:10,776
This is bad!

340
00:19:10,901 --> 00:19:12,611
Run!

341
00:19:13,278 --> 00:19:15,322
Thanks to Inosuke, we're in trouble.

342
00:19:15,322 --> 00:19:16,406
Apologize!

343
00:19:16,406 --> 00:19:17,491
What?

344
00:19:17,491 --> 00:19:20,827
Why are we running away
from the police?

345
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:24,748
It's because the Demon Slayer Corps
is not recognized by the government.

346
00:19:24,748 --> 00:19:27,501
Actually, we shouldn't walk around
with our swords.

347
00:19:27,751 --> 00:19:29,503
Even if we say
it's for fighting demons,

348
00:19:29,503 --> 00:19:30,921
no one would believe us.

349
00:19:30,963 --> 00:19:32,297
It will only cause chaos.

350
00:19:32,714 --> 00:19:35,050
We work so hard to kill demons.

351
00:19:36,134 --> 00:19:37,427
We have no choice.

352
00:19:37,427 --> 00:19:40,097
Anyway, just hide your sword behind.

353
00:19:43,976 --> 00:19:45,018
It's too obvious.

354
00:19:45,018 --> 00:19:46,311
Wear your shirt, idiot.

355
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:51,984
That's bad, the train is departing.

356
00:19:51,984 --> 00:19:53,360
Are the police still around?

357
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,945
We have to go
even if they're still here.

358
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:57,739
Showdown time,

359
00:19:57,739 --> 00:19:59,032
master of this land!

360
00:19:59,324 --> 00:20:00,450
That idiot!

361
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:01,869
Let's follow him!

362
00:20:02,619 --> 00:20:04,371
Hey! Three of you!

363
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:06,540
Tanjiro!

364
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:07,875
Inosuke!

365
00:20:07,875 --> 00:20:09,042
Zenitsu!

366
00:20:18,468 --> 00:20:19,761
That's fast!

367
00:20:21,972 --> 00:20:23,015
Tanjiro.

368
00:20:24,933 --> 00:20:27,561
Is it okay to bring Nezuko along?

369
00:20:28,187 --> 00:20:31,481
Isn't it safer to leave her at
the Demon Slayer Corps headquarters?

370
00:20:34,151 --> 00:20:36,278
It's better to bring her.

371
00:20:37,487 --> 00:20:40,657
I want to be with Nezuko
no matter where I go.

372
00:20:41,992 --> 00:20:44,536
We'll never be separated again.

373
00:21:03,555 --> 00:21:05,224
I'll save you!

374
00:21:06,016 --> 00:21:07,893
I'll definitely save you!

375
00:21:09,353 --> 00:21:10,938
Kibutsuji Muzan.

376
00:21:11,605 --> 00:21:13,273
I will not let you off the hook!

377
00:21:13,524 --> 00:21:15,943
Wherever you go, I won't let you go!

378
00:21:16,193 --> 00:21:17,819
We must be together.

379
00:21:18,862 --> 00:21:20,739
We won't be separated.

380
00:21:21,365 --> 00:21:23,825
My bond with Nezuko...

381
00:21:24,576 --> 00:21:25,744
cannot be broken...

382
00:21:26,203 --> 00:21:28,038
by anyone!

383
00:21:32,709 --> 00:21:33,710
Nezuko...

384
00:21:35,087 --> 00:21:36,129
I'll save you.

385
00:21:48,851 --> 00:21:50,060

I will give it all to do my duty.

390
00:23:50,556 --> 00:23:51,849
Everyone here...

391
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:53,308
will not die!
