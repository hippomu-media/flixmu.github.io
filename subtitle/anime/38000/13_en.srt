1
00:00:14,598 --> 00:00:16,683
I've done well so far.

2
00:00:17,309 --> 00:00:18,894
I'm a capable person!

3
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,104
It's the same today...

4
00:00:21,522 --> 00:00:22,898
and also in the future!

5
00:00:23,148 --> 00:00:24,983
No matter how many hardships I face,

6
00:00:26,985 --> 00:00:30,822
I would never feel discouraged!

7
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:48,590
(Demon Slayer)

8
00:02:05,209 --> 00:02:07,878
(Episode 13: Something
More Important than Life)

9
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:14,301
Tanjiro, where are you?

10
00:02:15,219 --> 00:02:17,638
I keep hearing uncomfortable sounds.

11
00:02:18,222 --> 00:02:20,057
You must stay safe, Tanjiro.

12
00:02:20,766 --> 00:02:22,726
Hey, Zenitsu.

13
00:02:22,768 --> 00:02:25,979
Are we going around in circles?

14
00:02:26,188 --> 00:02:29,441
Right? I knew it.

15
00:02:29,441 --> 00:02:30,692
You're Shoichi indeed.

16
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:32,194
You're so reliable.

17
00:02:32,194 --> 00:02:35,322
I'll take you to check out that room
to see if there's a problem, okay?

18
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:39,243
What? All right.

19
00:02:39,284 --> 00:02:40,619
Don't look at me that way!

20
00:02:40,619 --> 00:02:42,913
I'll go and check by myself.

21
00:02:49,044 --> 00:02:50,420
There's no one here.

22
00:02:52,047 --> 00:02:53,298
Let's go this way.

23
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:58,762
Tanjiro, come out.

24
00:03:01,056 --> 00:03:04,059
The room is moving!

25
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:26,790
I can do this.

26
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,500
I can definitely do this.

27
00:03:29,084 --> 00:03:30,752
I'm a man who can fully
accomplish my tasks.

28
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:36,175
It doesn't matter if I'm suffering
from bone fractures or whatever,

29
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:37,843
I can do this!

30
00:03:38,177 --> 00:03:39,469
I can battle!

31
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,605
I'll let you see
that the bone-fractured Tanjiro...

32
00:03:49,605 --> 00:03:50,689
is still as incredible!

33
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:02,409
This won't do.

34
00:04:02,451 --> 00:04:04,411
The situation hasn't changed at all.

35
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:06,997
Merely relying on my fighting spirit
can't change anything.

36
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:08,707
I must use my brain.

37
00:04:08,749 --> 00:04:10,876
I must use my brain
together with my fighting spirit.

38
00:04:13,545 --> 00:04:15,547
Use my brain.

39
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:21,970
That was close.

40
00:04:22,304 --> 00:04:24,056
That was really close.

41
00:04:24,515 --> 00:04:25,557
Darn it.

42
00:04:25,557 --> 00:04:27,142
This is so annoying.

43
00:04:27,142 --> 00:04:30,395
I must eat someone
with rare blood soon.

44
00:04:35,484 --> 00:04:37,402
There's no time
to use my brain at all.

45
00:04:40,572 --> 00:04:42,449
What is your name?

46
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:45,702
Kyogai.

47
00:04:46,745 --> 00:04:47,913
Kyogai.

48
00:04:48,247 --> 00:04:49,331
Kiyoshi.

49
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:51,291
I won't let you have his rare blood!

50
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:52,960
I would never feel discouraged.

51
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:54,711
I would never give up!

52
00:04:58,173 --> 00:04:59,925
Give up.

53
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:05,055
I want to get the rare blood...

54
00:05:05,681 --> 00:05:08,016
and return to
the Twelve Demon Moons!

55
00:05:20,821 --> 00:05:23,365
Give up.

56
00:05:26,618 --> 00:05:28,745
How boring.

57
00:05:35,252 --> 00:05:39,006
Your writing is really boring.

58
00:05:40,632 --> 00:05:44,136
Everything you wrote is like trash.

59
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:49,141
It's not beautiful,
fantastic, or shocking.

60
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:52,936
I think you should stop writing.

61
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:56,398
It would just be a waste
of paper and pen.

62
00:05:57,399 --> 00:06:01,069
You don't even go out
during the day lately.

63
00:06:01,653 --> 00:06:05,115
That's the reason
why you are boring.

64
00:06:05,908 --> 00:06:08,827
Or you can just
play drums as a hobby...

65
00:06:09,328 --> 00:06:11,163
since you want to lock yourself
in the house anyway.

66
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:17,419
But your drumming skills aren't at
a point where you can teach others.

67
00:06:49,535 --> 00:06:52,246
Be gone, insects!

68
00:06:52,538 --> 00:06:55,207
Speed drumming!

69
00:06:55,249 --> 00:06:58,418
Does this mean that he can play
his drums even faster?

70
00:07:15,686 --> 00:07:17,187
I'm so dizzy.

71
00:07:17,229 --> 00:07:20,023
The spinning speed isn't good.

72
00:07:20,023 --> 00:07:21,650
What a great technique.

73
00:07:24,236 --> 00:07:27,865
And his claw marks changed
from three to five.

74
00:07:39,877 --> 00:07:40,961
I get it now.

75
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:47,801
Good thing I intentionally avoided
stepping on the writings.

76
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:50,304
I know the movements
and breathing technique...

77
00:07:50,429 --> 00:07:52,181
to stop my body from aching.

78
00:07:54,057 --> 00:07:56,268
My breathing has to be
shallow and quick.

79
00:07:57,811 --> 00:07:59,104
With this kind of breathing,

80
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:02,649
I can strengthen the muscles
around the fracture in my foot.

81
00:08:02,691 --> 00:08:05,652
And before the claws attack me,

82
00:08:06,028 --> 00:08:07,988
there's a moldy smell.

83
00:08:10,365 --> 00:08:11,658
The claw attack is coming.

84
00:08:14,703 --> 00:08:15,746
Up there.

85
00:08:16,288 --> 00:08:17,331
Left side.

86
00:08:17,456 --> 00:08:18,540
Right side.

87
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:19,583
Behind me.

88
00:08:20,876 --> 00:08:23,212
He avoided all my attacks.

89
00:08:27,132 --> 00:08:28,175
Total Concentration Breathing.

90
00:08:28,383 --> 00:08:29,885
Water Breathing.

91
00:08:38,435 --> 00:08:39,478
Ninth Form!

92
00:08:39,895 --> 00:08:41,939
Splashing Water Flow, Turbulent!

93
00:08:42,898 --> 00:08:43,982
The timing of my landing.

94
00:08:43,982 --> 00:08:46,318
I must completely minimize
my landing space.

95
00:08:46,527 --> 00:08:49,029
He can deal with the spinning room.

96
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,114
Go, charge in.

97
00:08:51,114 --> 00:08:52,783
Go inside the attack range.

98
00:08:52,783 --> 00:08:53,951
Go forward.

99
00:08:53,992 --> 00:08:55,994
Go in front of him.

100
00:08:58,747 --> 00:09:00,582
I see the opening thread.

101
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:02,334
Kyogai.

102
00:09:02,376 --> 00:09:04,711
Your Blood Demon Art
is really incredible!

103
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:28,110
It hurts!

104
00:09:28,193 --> 00:09:31,071
I accidentally inhaled deeply.

105
00:09:33,574 --> 00:09:35,033
I'm the eldest son.

106
00:09:35,659 --> 00:09:37,202
The eldest son!

107
00:09:38,245 --> 00:09:39,788
Kid.

108
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:43,625
Answer me.

109
00:09:45,961 --> 00:09:51,550
Is my Blood Demon Art incredible?

110
00:09:54,344 --> 00:09:55,596
It is.

111
00:09:56,263 --> 00:09:57,306
However,

112
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:02,728
it's unforgivable to kill humans.

113
00:10:06,815 --> 00:10:08,400
I see.

114
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:12,154
Oh right.

115
00:10:12,154 --> 00:10:13,530
I must get a sample of his blood.

116
00:10:26,043 --> 00:10:27,503
I got the blood.

117
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:28,962
After sticking it in,

118
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:31,340
it would really automatically
draw blood.

119
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:33,383
I can't believe
he can make such a thing.

120
00:10:33,383 --> 00:10:35,052
Yushiro has amazing skills.

121
00:10:39,515 --> 00:10:40,599
A cat?

122
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:45,062
You're going to take this
to Lady Tamayo, right?

123
00:10:45,729 --> 00:10:46,855
You're so good.

124
00:10:46,855 --> 00:10:47,981
Thank you.

125
00:10:51,318 --> 00:10:52,569
All right then.

126
00:10:52,653 --> 00:10:54,321
Okay. Take care on your way back.

127
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:02,955
I heard that Yushiro's spell...

128
00:11:02,955 --> 00:11:05,082
makes the cat invisible
before she meows.

129
00:11:05,207 --> 00:11:08,502
And she would disappear
after she meows again.

130
00:11:08,919 --> 00:11:10,462
So it's true.

131
00:11:13,298 --> 00:11:14,299
I must go...

132
00:11:15,259 --> 00:11:16,510
and find the other kids.

133
00:11:22,349 --> 00:11:26,186
My writings.

134
00:11:28,397 --> 00:11:32,526
Your writing is really boring.

135
00:11:33,485 --> 00:11:36,905
Everything you wrote is like trash.

136
00:11:38,323 --> 00:11:42,035
It's not beautiful,
fantastic, or shocking.

137
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:47,291
They're not trash,

138
00:11:49,001 --> 00:11:52,462
at least to that kid.

139
00:11:52,462 --> 00:11:56,258
It's not something that can
be easily stepped on.

140
00:11:57,301 --> 00:11:59,219
Please go and reincarnate.

141
00:12:07,644 --> 00:12:12,774
My Blood Demon Art and drumming...

142
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:17,112
have been recognized.

143
00:12:30,292 --> 00:12:32,961
Kiyoshi, Teruko.

144
00:12:33,378 --> 00:12:35,839
Kiyoshi, Teruko.

145
00:12:37,299 --> 00:12:39,092
Kiyoshi, Teruko.

146
00:12:46,225 --> 00:12:47,518
Tanjiro.

147
00:12:48,227 --> 00:12:50,729
Why are you throwing things at me?

148
00:12:50,896 --> 00:12:52,105
I'm sorry.

149
00:12:52,147 --> 00:12:54,525
Because we felt confused
after the drums are gone.

150
00:12:56,026 --> 00:12:57,110
I see.

151
00:12:57,361 --> 00:12:58,362
However, this is great.

152
00:12:58,362 --> 00:12:59,530
You're both fine.

153
00:13:05,619 --> 00:13:07,162
You worked really hard.

154
00:13:07,955 --> 00:13:09,039
Kiyoshi too.

155
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:11,291
All right.

156
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:12,459
Let's go outside.

157
00:13:13,085 --> 00:13:14,545
Come on, I'll carry you.

158
00:13:17,089 --> 00:13:18,507
Is your foot fine?

159
00:13:18,674 --> 00:13:19,716
Yes.

160
00:13:19,967 --> 00:13:21,969
Just endure it for a bit.

161
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:25,389
It's Zenitsu and Shoichi's smell.

162
00:13:26,473 --> 00:13:28,141
They went outside.

163
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:29,977
They're both fine.

164
00:13:30,936 --> 00:13:32,187
It's the smell of blood.

165
00:13:33,188 --> 00:13:34,189
Is something wrong?

166
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:35,524
It's nothing.

167
00:13:35,524 --> 00:13:36,608
Let's go.

168
00:13:47,244 --> 00:13:48,245
Move!

169
00:13:49,955 --> 00:13:51,957
Pull out your sword and fight,

170
00:13:51,957 --> 00:13:54,001
you coward!

171
00:14:00,674 --> 00:14:02,009
Tanjiro.

172
00:14:03,802 --> 00:14:06,555
I protected the box.

173
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:10,809
Because you said...

174
00:14:10,934 --> 00:14:13,937
that this is something...

175
00:14:15,981 --> 00:14:17,357
more important than your life.

176
00:14:24,448 --> 00:14:25,574
I'm someone...

177
00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:29,077
who have always had
a good sense of hearing.

178
00:14:31,413 --> 00:14:36,502
Sometimes, I can even hear
people talking when I'm sleeping,

179
00:14:37,252 --> 00:14:39,254
making people terrified of me.

180
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:44,009
The demon's sound disappeared.

181
00:14:45,052 --> 00:14:46,094
Tanjiro.

182
00:14:46,303 --> 00:14:48,180
You defeated the demon, right?

183
00:14:49,097 --> 00:14:50,682
Aside from Tanjiro,

184
00:14:50,974 --> 00:14:54,895
there's a strange
and noisy footstep.

185
00:14:56,605 --> 00:14:58,857
Zenitsu.

186
00:14:59,858 --> 00:15:01,610
Zenitsu!

187
00:15:05,697 --> 00:15:06,907
This is great.

188
00:15:06,949 --> 00:15:08,450
Are you all right?

189
00:15:09,785 --> 00:15:11,912
When the room changed,

190
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,830
we were thrown outside forcefully.

191
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:16,416
We fell from the window
on the second floor.

192
00:15:19,586 --> 00:15:20,879
Is that so?

193
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:24,091
You protected me, Zenitsu.

194
00:15:24,174 --> 00:15:26,385
That's why I didn't get hurt.

195
00:15:26,969 --> 00:15:28,512
That's great.

196
00:15:29,263 --> 00:15:32,099
But why are you crying so sadly?

197
00:15:37,604 --> 00:15:39,314
I see.

198
00:15:39,314 --> 00:15:42,317
- My head hit the ground!
- Yes.

199
00:15:42,609 --> 00:15:43,819
Will I die?

200
00:15:43,819 --> 00:15:45,112
Am I going to die?

201
00:15:46,363 --> 00:15:49,408
I feel so dizzy.

202
00:15:50,367 --> 00:15:52,619
What's the matter?

203
00:15:52,786 --> 00:15:57,124
Boar incoming!

204
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:00,335
He's here again!

205
00:16:00,335 --> 00:16:02,504
The boar monster!

206
00:16:05,174 --> 00:16:07,259
There's a demonic vibe.

207
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:09,094
That guy.

208
00:16:09,178 --> 00:16:11,180
After hearing his voice now,
I realized...

209
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:13,265
that he's the fifth person...

210
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:15,392
who passed in the Final Selection.

211
00:16:15,392 --> 00:16:17,561
He went into the mountain
earlier than everyone...

212
00:16:17,561 --> 00:16:19,855
and he went down the mountain
earlier than everyone too.

213
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:21,523
What an impatient guy!

214
00:16:26,278 --> 00:16:28,655
I found it!

215
00:16:30,365 --> 00:16:31,950
Stop!

216
00:16:34,745 --> 00:16:35,871
What?

217
00:16:35,913 --> 00:16:37,080
What are you doing?

218
00:16:37,372 --> 00:16:38,832
Move!

219
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:41,376
I'm Agatsuma Zenitsu.

220
00:16:41,627 --> 00:16:44,338
I'm also a member
of the Demon Slayer Corps like you.

221
00:16:45,797 --> 00:16:47,216
The Demon Slayer Corps?

222
00:16:47,341 --> 00:16:49,176
Then you should know.

223
00:16:49,176 --> 00:16:51,678
That thing must be eliminated!

224
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:53,889
Aren't you going to move?

225
00:16:53,889 --> 00:16:55,057
I won't!

226
00:16:55,432 --> 00:16:56,892
This belongs to Tanjiro.

227
00:16:56,892 --> 00:16:58,310
Stop dilly-dallying!

228
00:16:58,769 --> 00:17:02,481
Or I'll just destroy the box too!

229
00:17:02,814 --> 00:17:05,234
Move!

230
00:17:07,778 --> 00:17:09,363
You punk.

231
00:17:10,322 --> 00:17:11,657
I can't...

232
00:17:12,491 --> 00:17:15,369
let you do anything to the box!

233
00:17:15,577 --> 00:17:17,829
It's very precious to Tanjiro.

234
00:17:20,082 --> 00:17:21,667
What are you talking about?

235
00:17:21,917 --> 00:17:24,086
There's a demon inside the box.

236
00:17:24,294 --> 00:17:25,754
Don't you know that?

237
00:17:26,171 --> 00:17:28,674
I know that right from the start!

238
00:17:31,009 --> 00:17:33,387
I know that he's been
taking a demon with him.

239
00:17:34,513 --> 00:17:35,514
Because the sounds of...

240
00:17:35,806 --> 00:17:38,308
demon and human
are completely different.

241
00:17:39,393 --> 00:17:40,394
However,

242
00:17:41,144 --> 00:17:42,646
I hear a gentle sound
coming from Tanjiro's body...

243
00:17:42,646 --> 00:17:45,524
that makes me want to cry.

244
00:17:46,942 --> 00:17:50,863
I've never heard
such a gentle sound before.

245
00:17:52,906 --> 00:17:56,410
Living things
would surely make sounds.

246
00:17:57,035 --> 00:17:59,830
They'll produce many sounds.

247
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:02,374
The sound of their breathing.

248
00:18:02,374 --> 00:18:03,458
The sound of their heartbeat.

249
00:18:03,584 --> 00:18:05,169
The sound of their blood flowing.

250
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:08,005
As long as I focus on listening
to those sounds,

251
00:18:08,297 --> 00:18:11,008
I'll find out what
that person is thinking.

252
00:18:12,467 --> 00:18:15,470
However, I always get fooled.

253
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:21,018
I only trust in people
I want to believe in.

254
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:24,855
As a member
of the Demon Slayer Corps,

255
00:18:24,855 --> 00:18:27,024
Tanjiro is bringing a demon
to perform his task.

256
00:18:27,649 --> 00:18:31,695
However, he must have his reasons.

257
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:36,491
I believe it's a reason
that I can accept.

258
00:18:37,826 --> 00:18:38,952
I...

259
00:18:40,996 --> 00:18:45,000
I want to ask Tanjiro directly.

260
00:18:45,459 --> 00:18:49,213
So, move!

261
00:18:58,013 --> 00:18:59,640
Let me go!

262
00:19:01,517 --> 00:19:02,935
Are you done?

263
00:19:08,398 --> 00:19:10,442
I won't let you touch the box.

264
00:19:13,028 --> 00:19:17,115
That's very precious to Tanjiro.

265
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:21,787
Before he returns,

266
00:19:21,787 --> 00:19:23,080
I won't let you touch it!

267
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:24,706
Darn it.

268
00:19:31,672 --> 00:19:33,048
Move.

269
00:19:33,507 --> 00:19:34,842
I don't want to!

270
00:19:42,266 --> 00:19:43,350
Move!

271
00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:46,854
Pull out your sword and fight,

272
00:19:46,854 --> 00:19:48,897
you coward!

273
00:19:55,529 --> 00:19:56,780
Tanjiro.

274
00:19:58,699 --> 00:20:01,493
I protected the box.

275
00:20:02,411 --> 00:20:05,747
Because you said...

276
00:20:05,956 --> 00:20:08,834
that this is something...

277
00:20:10,752 --> 00:20:12,171
more important than your life.

278
00:20:14,006 --> 00:20:16,633
You're all talk,

279
00:20:16,633 --> 00:20:19,303
yet you wouldn't pull out
your sword.

280
00:20:19,636 --> 00:20:21,263
Since we're both members of
the Demon Slayer Corps,

281
00:20:21,305 --> 00:20:23,265
let's fight it out!

282
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:33,192
If you won't fight with me, move!

283
00:20:39,823 --> 00:20:41,325
Move!

284
00:20:50,334 --> 00:20:51,752
Never mind.

285
00:20:52,419 --> 00:20:55,506
If you continue to get in my way,

286
00:20:56,256 --> 00:21:00,010
I'll stab you and the box together.

287
00:21:05,224 --> 00:21:06,391
Stop!

288
00:21:13,273 --> 00:21:17,653
I said stop!

289
00:23:00,005 --> 00:23:01,006
(Demon Slayer)

290
00:23:03,342 --> 00:23:05,886
He can even attack
while the room is spinning.

291
00:23:05,886 --> 00:23:07,429
What an incredible Blood Demon Art.

292
00:23:08,555 --> 00:23:10,224
The more similar
the demon is to Kibutsuji,

293
00:23:10,224 --> 00:23:12,601
the more they can use
strong Blood Demon Arts.

294
00:23:12,601 --> 00:23:14,811
Can I really win against them?

295
00:23:15,854 --> 00:23:18,482
Now, let me tell you
a Taisho secret!

296
00:23:18,565 --> 00:23:20,150
I heard that the demon Kyogai,
who lives in the house,

297
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:21,860
loves "Legend of the Eight Samurai".

298
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:24,613
He even wrote
a legendary novel himself.

299
00:23:25,989 --> 00:23:27,741
Now isn't the time
to feel frustrated.

300
00:23:27,824 --> 00:23:29,284
Next, Episode 14,

301
00:23:29,284 --> 00:23:30,994
"The House
with the Wisteria Family Crest".

302
00:23:30,994 --> 00:23:32,829
I'll do my best!

303
00:23:32,829 --> 00:23:35,582
Ouch! I forgot that I still
have bone fractures.

304
00:23:37,042 --> 00:23:40,003
(To be continued)
