1
00:00:06,381 --> 00:00:07,466
Excuse me.

2
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:08,926
Can you give me...

3
00:00:08,926 --> 00:00:11,094
the basket and straws over there
as well as some bamboo?

4
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:13,805
That's fine.

5
00:00:14,139 --> 00:00:16,558
But the basket has holes.

6
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,602
All right, I'll pay you.

7
00:00:18,644 --> 00:00:19,978
No, there's no need to pay me.

8
00:00:19,978 --> 00:00:21,688
It's a broken basket anyway.

9
00:00:22,105 --> 00:00:23,732
No, I want to pay.

10
00:00:24,066 --> 00:00:25,526
No, there's no need.

11
00:00:25,526 --> 00:00:27,486
The bamboos and straws are free too.

12
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:29,112
I still want to pay!

13
00:00:29,112 --> 00:00:30,614
No, there's no need!

14
00:00:30,614 --> 00:00:32,658
You're such a stubborn child.

15
00:00:34,117 --> 00:00:35,619
Please count them.

16
00:00:35,619 --> 00:00:37,120
I only have coins!

17
00:00:37,162 --> 00:00:38,830
Thank you very much!

18
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:41,208
That hurts!

19
00:00:44,378 --> 00:00:45,379
Nezuko.

20
00:00:45,921 --> 00:00:46,922
That's strange.

21
00:00:46,922 --> 00:00:47,923
Nezuko.

22
00:00:48,382 --> 00:00:49,633
Why isn't she inside?

23
00:00:52,094 --> 00:00:53,262
So you're here.

24
00:01:09,111 --> 00:01:13,657
(Demon Slayer)

25
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,986
(Episode 2:
Trainer Urokodaki Sakonji)

26
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:35,656
Nezuko.

27
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:38,659
You dug a hole.

28
00:02:39,243 --> 00:02:42,246
You turned into a mole.

29
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:48,627
And she doesn't look happy at all.

30
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:51,421
She really hates
being exposed to sunlight.

31
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:53,841
Wait a moment.

32
00:02:58,303 --> 00:02:59,304
Nezuko.

33
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:00,430
Nezuko.

34
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:02,516
Do you want to come in here?

35
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:05,519
I want to travel during the day too.

36
00:03:06,478 --> 00:03:08,105
I'll carry you.

37
00:03:09,982 --> 00:03:10,983
Go...

38
00:03:11,108 --> 00:03:12,109
inside...

39
00:03:12,484 --> 00:03:13,652
this basket.

40
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:22,160
You don't fit.

41
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:26,707
Nezuko has grown up too.

42
00:03:26,999 --> 00:03:29,668
She was obviously smaller before.

43
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:32,671
Nezuko.

44
00:03:32,963 --> 00:03:36,425
You suddenly grew up
and turned into a woman before.

45
00:03:36,967 --> 00:03:38,260
Can you do the opposite...

46
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:39,678
and become smaller now?

47
00:03:40,596 --> 00:03:42,431
Become smaller, Nezuko.

48
00:03:42,598 --> 00:03:44,183
Can you become smaller?

49
00:03:55,027 --> 00:03:56,236
Incredible.

50
00:03:56,403 --> 00:03:58,030
You're such a good girl, Nezuko.

51
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,406
You're amazing.

52
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:04,953
Sagiri Mountain?

53
00:04:05,537 --> 00:04:07,039
If you want to go
to Sagiri Mountain,

54
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:09,541
you must first pass that mountain.

55
00:04:10,209 --> 00:04:11,793
But the sun has already set.

56
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:14,171
Will you be going there
with such a big basket?

57
00:04:14,463 --> 00:04:15,589
It would be dangerous.

58
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:18,258
I'll be very careful.

59
00:04:19,218 --> 00:04:20,427
Thank you so much.

60
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:27,100
Lately, people often go missing
for no reason.

61
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:28,894
Don't get lost.

62
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:39,905
There's a shrine over there.

63
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:42,407
It has a light on.

64
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:44,117
There seems to be someone inside.

65
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:45,869
Let's go and take a look.

66
00:04:49,915 --> 00:04:51,333
I smell blood.

67
00:04:52,042 --> 00:04:53,710
This path is very steep.

68
00:04:53,752 --> 00:04:55,212
Someone must be hurt.

69
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:04,304
Are you all right?

70
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:13,689
What do you want?

71
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:16,984
This is my turf.

72
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:19,987
I won't spare you...

73
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:21,864
If you invade my territory.

74
00:05:22,531 --> 00:05:23,991
A human-eating demon.

75
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:39,590
Why am I getting a strange feeling?

76
00:05:41,216 --> 00:05:44,553
Are you two human?

77
00:06:00,027 --> 00:06:01,069
An ax.

78
00:06:01,236 --> 00:06:02,362
You're good.

79
00:06:02,821 --> 00:06:04,531
But a minor cut like this...

80
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:07,034
heals quickly.

81
00:06:09,953 --> 00:06:11,038
Look.

82
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:12,956
The bleeding has stopped.

83
00:06:30,432 --> 00:06:31,558
He's quick.

84
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:33,644
And why is he so strong?

85
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:36,271
I won't let you cut me twice.

86
00:06:37,272 --> 00:06:40,108
Let's see how I'll break your neck.

87
00:07:02,923 --> 00:07:03,966
I...

88
00:07:03,966 --> 00:07:06,051
I can't believe you killed him.

89
00:07:06,343 --> 00:07:08,720
But he's a human-eating demon.

90
00:07:09,012 --> 00:07:11,014
Nezuko.

91
00:07:16,353 --> 00:07:17,604
I can't believe it.

92
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:19,231
His head is already on the ground,

93
00:07:19,356 --> 00:07:21,108
but his body is still moving.

94
00:07:21,358 --> 00:07:22,568
One of you...

95
00:07:24,236 --> 00:07:26,405
is a demon indeed.

96
00:07:26,488 --> 00:07:28,782
No wonder your aura is very strange.

97
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:32,077
Why would a human be with a demon?

98
00:07:32,244 --> 00:07:33,871
He's still talking!

99
00:07:42,546 --> 00:07:43,547
Stop!

100
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:53,348
Nezuko!

101
00:08:01,106 --> 00:08:02,357
Nezuko.

102
00:08:07,946 --> 00:08:10,282
What the heck is this?

103
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,993
His head has grown a hand.

104
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,995
I must save Nezuko.

105
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:18,665
Scram!

106
00:08:23,128 --> 00:08:25,214
This guy is so tough.

107
00:08:26,048 --> 00:08:27,466
His head...

108
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:29,343
is so hard.

109
00:08:38,769 --> 00:08:39,770
All right.

110
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:43,315
I originally wanted to grab the ax,

111
00:08:43,315 --> 00:08:44,816
but my hair got caught on it.

112
00:08:44,816 --> 00:08:45,984
Crap!

113
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,530
Nezuko!

114
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:51,240
Where are you?

115
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:05,045
Nezuko.

116
00:09:05,504 --> 00:09:06,713
Stop!

117
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:45,210
Are there a lot of demons?

118
00:09:46,336 --> 00:09:48,672
His scent is different
from what I smelled in our house.

119
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:50,090
He's not the same demon.

120
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:54,386
But if I don't kill him,

121
00:09:54,678 --> 00:09:56,221
he'll eat other humans again.

122
00:09:57,222 --> 00:09:58,348
So...

123
00:09:59,641 --> 00:10:00,934
I have to kill him.

124
00:10:07,191 --> 00:10:08,275
Do it!

125
00:10:17,743 --> 00:10:20,954
That can't kill him.

126
00:10:22,748 --> 00:10:23,916
Tengu mask.

127
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:27,211
I couldn't hear his footsteps.

128
00:10:29,087 --> 00:10:31,673
What must I do to kill him?

129
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:33,509
Don't ask others.

130
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:36,762
Can't you use your brain and think?

131
00:10:40,349 --> 00:10:41,850
If I can't kill him with a knife,

132
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,145
I have to crush his head completely.

133
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:55,614
I must break his skull
and destroy the entire head.

134
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:58,825
I must hit him
with a rock repeatedly.

135
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:01,328
I think that would really hurt.

136
00:11:02,412 --> 00:11:05,499
Isn't there a way
to kill him quickly?

137
00:11:11,547 --> 00:11:13,257
This child is not going to cut it.

138
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:17,761
He's too considerate and indecisive.

139
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,639
With a demon in front of him,

140
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:22,850
I can still smell his kind aura.

141
00:11:23,267 --> 00:11:26,061
I can't believe he's
so compassionate towards a demon.

142
00:11:27,646 --> 00:11:28,939
Giyu.

143
00:11:30,107 --> 00:11:32,276
This child won't make it.

144
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:40,367
I fainted.

145
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:43,412
Could it be that my body is dead?

146
00:11:43,829 --> 00:11:46,039
I don't feel good at all.

147
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,960
You jerk! I'll kill you!

148
00:11:50,002 --> 00:11:51,295
I'm going to eat
your flesh and bones.

149
00:11:51,295 --> 00:11:53,255
Come here!

150
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:54,756
I can't go over there,

151
00:11:54,798 --> 00:11:56,466
so come here.

152
00:11:57,384 --> 00:12:00,554
- The sun will rise soon.
- Come over here.

153
00:12:00,721 --> 00:12:03,056
Hey! Are you listening, you jerk?

154
00:12:15,319 --> 00:12:17,821
They vaporized
after being exposed to the sun!

155
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:20,157
No wonder Nezuko hates the sun.

156
00:12:22,743 --> 00:12:23,744
Nezuko.

157
00:12:24,411 --> 00:12:25,495
Nezuko!

158
00:12:40,594 --> 00:12:41,845
Nezuko.

159
00:12:45,849 --> 00:12:48,101
By the way, where's that guy?

160
00:12:57,528 --> 00:13:00,781
He buried the victims.

161
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:07,120
Excuse me...

162
00:13:09,623 --> 00:13:12,417
I'm Urokodaki Sakonji.

163
00:13:12,835 --> 00:13:16,547
You're the one that Tomioka Giyu
recommended, right?

164
00:13:17,047 --> 00:13:18,048
Yes.

165
00:13:18,173 --> 00:13:19,800
My name is Kamado Tanjiro.

166
00:13:20,551 --> 00:13:22,219
My sister's name is Nezuko.

167
00:13:22,469 --> 00:13:23,887
Tanjiro.

168
00:13:24,471 --> 00:13:26,056
If your sister eats a human,

169
00:13:26,056 --> 00:13:27,850
what would you do?

170
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,070
You're too slow
in making a decision!

171
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:43,866
You're too indecisive.

172
00:13:44,366 --> 00:13:47,661
That's why you failed to kill
the demon before sunrise.

173
00:13:48,287 --> 00:13:49,705
Why can't you...

174
00:13:49,705 --> 00:13:53,083
immediately answer my question?

175
00:13:53,292 --> 00:13:55,711
Because your determination
is too shallow.

176
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:59,840
There are only two things to do
if your sister eats a human.

177
00:14:00,215 --> 00:14:01,717
Kill your sister,

178
00:14:01,884 --> 00:14:04,178
then kill yourself.

179
00:14:04,511 --> 00:14:06,430
When traveling alongside
your sister who's a demon,

180
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:08,640
you must have understood that.

181
00:14:09,558 --> 00:14:12,519
But there's one thing
that can never happen.

182
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:14,396
Remember this well.

183
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:18,317
Letting your sister
take innocent human lives...

184
00:14:18,317 --> 00:14:21,403
is something that can never happen.

185
00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:24,615
Do you understand what I said?

186
00:14:24,656 --> 00:14:25,699
Yes.

187
00:14:26,742 --> 00:14:29,453
Let me start testing you now...

188
00:14:29,453 --> 00:14:33,415
to see if you can become
a demon slayer.

189
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:36,752
Carry your sister and follow me.

190
00:14:46,512 --> 00:14:47,513
He's so fast!

191
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:49,681
How old exactly is this man?

192
00:14:50,015 --> 00:14:53,101
And his steps are completely silent.

193
00:14:55,103 --> 00:14:56,104
Nezuko.

194
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:57,397
It must be really bumpy in there.

195
00:14:57,397 --> 00:14:58,482
Just hang on.

196
00:15:01,068 --> 00:15:03,320
You've always been very patient.

197
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:06,240
Right, Nezuko?

198
00:15:08,033 --> 00:15:09,743
Are you mending clothes again?

199
00:15:10,452 --> 00:15:12,829
I must buy new clothes for you.

200
00:15:13,372 --> 00:15:15,624
It's fine. There's no need.

201
00:15:15,707 --> 00:15:17,709
This is my favorite.

202
00:15:18,335 --> 00:15:20,254
Instead of buying clothes,

203
00:15:20,254 --> 00:15:22,673
get our siblings more food.

204
00:15:25,092 --> 00:15:27,803
I'll surely turn you back
into a human.

205
00:15:28,053 --> 00:15:31,348
Someday, I'm going to buy
beautiful clothes for you.

206
00:15:32,182 --> 00:15:34,518
Everything that I couldn't do
for the others,

207
00:15:35,561 --> 00:15:36,854
I'll do it all for you.

208
00:15:44,653 --> 00:15:45,696
Can this...

209
00:15:45,696 --> 00:15:46,780
make you...

210
00:15:47,322 --> 00:15:49,658
acknowledge me?

211
00:15:57,624 --> 00:15:59,626
The test is just about to begin.

212
00:15:59,877 --> 00:16:01,628
We'll be climbing a mountain.

213
00:16:06,633 --> 00:16:10,304
I promise I'll take care
of your sister.

214
00:16:12,264 --> 00:16:13,891
Thank you.

215
00:16:26,737 --> 00:16:30,949
My legs are weak
because I'm so tired...

216
00:16:32,034 --> 00:16:33,827
and I feel dizzy.

217
00:16:37,915 --> 00:16:41,710
Go down the mountain from here
to my home.

218
00:16:42,586 --> 00:16:45,130
This time, I won't wait for you
until sunrise.

219
00:16:50,469 --> 00:16:51,678
That's it?

220
00:16:54,306 --> 00:16:55,307
I get it now.

221
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:58,727
He thought
that I'd get lost in the fog.

222
00:16:59,978 --> 00:17:02,314
I just need to go back
before sunrise.

223
00:17:03,023 --> 00:17:04,107
That's very easy.

224
00:17:04,358 --> 00:17:05,817
I have a great sense of smell.

225
00:17:06,193 --> 00:17:08,695
And I've already remembered
Mr. Urokodaki's smell.

226
00:17:20,082 --> 00:17:21,166
A stone.

227
00:17:33,262 --> 00:17:34,513
A trap.

228
00:17:35,764 --> 00:17:37,057
I see.

229
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:40,519
So there are lots of traps
on the way back.

230
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:42,855
I see.

231
00:17:44,523 --> 00:17:45,524
Oh no.

232
00:17:51,655 --> 00:17:53,490
This is very bad.

233
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:55,742
If I keep falling into traps,

234
00:17:55,868 --> 00:17:57,870
I wouldn't be able to make it
down the mountain by sunrise.

235
00:17:58,662 --> 00:18:00,706
And this mountain...

236
00:18:01,206 --> 00:18:02,416
The air in this mountain...

237
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:05,294
is very thin.

238
00:18:05,752 --> 00:18:07,546
It's even thinner than
on the mountain where I lived in.

239
00:18:07,588 --> 00:18:09,047
That's why it's so hard to breathe.

240
00:18:09,673 --> 00:18:12,217
And I feel dizzy.

241
00:18:12,217 --> 00:18:13,719
Not only in the past,

242
00:18:14,636 --> 00:18:18,182
but I might still faint now.

243
00:18:18,891 --> 00:18:21,435
No, I must go back.

244
00:18:22,186 --> 00:18:23,937
I must control my breathing.

245
00:18:24,521 --> 00:18:26,732
I must smell the traps.

246
00:18:51,673 --> 00:18:53,258
All right, I can differentiate them.

247
00:18:53,258 --> 00:18:54,343
I can differentiate them.

248
00:18:54,676 --> 00:18:56,637
The traps set up by people...

249
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,348
smell a bit different.

250
00:19:05,896 --> 00:19:07,022
Even so,

251
00:19:09,024 --> 00:19:11,235
I can't suddenly
become so powerful...

252
00:19:11,527 --> 00:19:14,863
that I can avoid all the traps!

253
00:19:15,781 --> 00:19:18,450
I must make it back!

254
00:19:19,243 --> 00:19:20,744
Nezuko!

255
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:54,027
I'm back...

256
00:19:56,864 --> 00:19:57,948
Forgive me for the abruptness.

257
00:19:58,407 --> 00:20:00,033
Mr. Urokodaki Sakonji.

258
00:20:01,618 --> 00:20:04,454
I'm sending a young man who
wants to become a demon slayer...

259
00:20:04,788 --> 00:20:06,290
your way.

260
00:20:07,958 --> 00:20:10,919
He was bold enough
to challenge me unarmed.

261
00:20:12,754 --> 00:20:14,673
His family has all
been killed by demons.

262
00:20:15,007 --> 00:20:17,926
His sister survived,
but turned into a demon.

263
00:20:18,677 --> 00:20:21,555
But based on my judgment,
she wouldn't harm humans.

264
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:24,766
I can sense something different...

265
00:20:25,267 --> 00:20:27,769
from these two siblings.

266
00:20:29,062 --> 00:20:31,064
The young man seems to have...

267
00:20:31,315 --> 00:20:32,941
a strong sense of smell like you.

268
00:20:34,359 --> 00:20:35,694
Perhaps he would...

269
00:20:35,819 --> 00:20:39,781
have a breakthrough
and become a successor.

270
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:43,076
I'm requesting you to train him.

271
00:20:44,786 --> 00:20:47,456
I know that this is
an unreasonable request.

272
00:20:48,081 --> 00:20:49,750
Please forgive me.

273
00:20:51,418 --> 00:20:54,963
Please take care of yourself.

274
00:20:55,714 --> 00:20:57,382
May you further refine your skills.

275
00:20:58,967 --> 00:21:00,219
In such haste, there are still
many things left unsaid.

276
00:21:00,886 --> 00:21:02,346
Tomioka Giyu.

277
00:21:20,739 --> 00:21:22,616
I acknowledge you.

278
00:21:23,283 --> 00:21:25,077
Kamado Tanjiro.

279
00:22:59,922 --> 00:23:01,173
(Demon Slayer)

280
00:23:03,383 --> 00:23:05,761
That demon in the shrine
was terrifying.

281
00:23:05,969 --> 00:23:08,472
I can't believe his head
grew a hand.

282
00:23:10,182 --> 00:23:12,351
Since Mr. Urokodaki
already acknowledged me,

283
00:23:12,476 --> 00:23:14,603
I'll work hard from now on.

284
00:23:15,896 --> 00:23:19,024
Now, let me tell you
a Taisho secret!

285
00:23:19,024 --> 00:23:22,027
The age of the trainer
who wears a Tengu mask,

286
00:23:22,027 --> 00:23:23,445
Mr. Urokodaki is...

287
00:23:23,445 --> 00:23:25,155
- Tanjiro!
- Yes!

288
00:23:25,155 --> 00:23:27,324
Potato stew with meat or oden.

289
00:23:27,324 --> 00:23:28,450
Which one do you want for dinner?

290
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:30,118
Well...

291
00:23:30,118 --> 00:23:31,745
You're too slow
in making a decision!

292
00:23:31,745 --> 00:23:33,288
I want oden!

293
00:23:33,622 --> 00:23:36,083
Next, Episode 3,
"Sabito and Makomo".

294
00:23:36,917 --> 00:23:39,962
(To be continued)
