1
00:00:03.253 --> 00:00:04.963
It's about time you die now!

2
00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:14.973
Twist!

3
00:00:14.973 --> 00:00:16.308
Enfold!

4
00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:19.895
Whirlpool!

5
00:00:20.395 --> 00:00:21.563
Flow!

6
00:00:27.861 --> 00:00:29.530
My sword is so heavy!

7
00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:32.115
But...

8
00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:35.077
Second Form Improved!

9
00:00:35.994 --> 00:00:38.539
Lateral Water Wheel!

10
00:00:55.097 --> 00:00:59.434
(Demon Slayer)

11
00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.889
(Episode 10: Together Forever)

12
00:02:32.194 --> 00:02:33.320
I succeeded.

13
00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:36.031
If I'm not in the water,
the whirlpool's power would weaken.

14
00:02:36.698 --> 00:02:39.159
Good thing my opponent attacked,
so it added power...

15
00:02:39.284 --> 00:02:40.953
for the arrowhead
to become entangled.

16
00:02:43.413 --> 00:02:44.498
Darn it.

17
00:02:44.498 --> 00:02:45.832
Darn it!

18
00:02:46.041 --> 00:02:48.001
I obviously just need
to bring your head back...

19
00:02:48.043 --> 00:02:50.796
and I can get
that important man's approval!

20
00:02:51.004 --> 00:02:55.467
Unforgivable!

21
00:02:55.676 --> 00:02:58.887
You let dirty mud
get stuck on my face!

22
00:02:59.429 --> 00:03:01.723
I want you to die with me!

23
00:03:04.852 --> 00:03:05.894
Oh no.

24
00:03:05.894 --> 00:03:06.895
I wasn't able to completely
defeat him just now.

25
00:03:08.355 --> 00:03:09.982
Among the arrowheads
that attacked me since earlier,

26
00:03:09.982 --> 00:03:11.942
this one has the strongest traction,

27
00:03:12.276 --> 00:03:14.611
If I don't consecutively attack
to counter it,

28
00:03:14.611 --> 00:03:16.405
my body will break apart.

29
00:03:17.197 --> 00:03:18.323
Fourth Form!

30
00:03:18.323 --> 00:03:19.449
Striking Tide!

31
00:03:24.913 --> 00:03:26.874
I feel a heavy pressure on my body,

32
00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.001
making me unable to use my sword.

33
00:03:29.126 --> 00:03:30.127
Make a move.

34
00:03:30.502 --> 00:03:31.795
I must make a move.

35
00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:35.299
I can't be defeated
in a place like this!

36
00:03:35.716 --> 00:03:36.842
Second Form!

37
00:03:37.134 --> 00:03:38.719
Water Wheel!

38
00:03:44.141 --> 00:03:45.601
Waterfall Basin!

39
00:03:48.645 --> 00:03:49.980
Surface Slash!

40
00:03:50.397 --> 00:03:51.982
Drop Ripple Thrust Curve!

41
00:03:52.441 --> 00:03:53.901
Whirlpool!

42
00:03:54.484 --> 00:03:57.279
I've never attacked consecutively
like this before.

43
00:03:57.905 --> 00:04:00.741
It seems my hands are going
to break into many pieces.

44
00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:04.203
That's not enough.

45
00:04:04.411 --> 00:04:08.498
I want you to suffer more!

46
00:04:15.631 --> 00:04:17.090
How many more times?

47
00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:19.343
How many times would be enough?

48
00:04:20.302 --> 00:04:21.470
Stop thinking about it!

49
00:04:21.595 --> 00:04:23.430
Just attack continuously!

50
00:04:23.555 --> 00:04:25.432
Attack continuously!

51
00:04:30.854 --> 00:04:32.356
This won't do.

52
00:04:32.814 --> 00:04:35.943
It's not enough.

53
00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:56.213
Nezuko.

54
00:04:56.255 --> 00:04:57.339
Lady Tamayo.

55
00:04:57.548 --> 00:04:58.799
Yushiro.

56
00:05:01.426 --> 00:05:03.428
My ribs and feet are broken.

57
00:05:10.185 --> 00:05:11.311
This is bad.

58
00:05:11.812 --> 00:05:13.355
I'm too exhausted...

59
00:05:13.689 --> 00:05:14.898
to even hold the sword.

60
00:05:15.816 --> 00:05:16.859
I must...

61
00:05:17.276 --> 00:05:18.402
go over there quickly.

62
00:05:19.611 --> 00:05:21.238
The demon is still over there.

63
00:05:24.783 --> 00:05:26.493
I must go there right now.

64
00:05:27.661 --> 00:05:29.204
I'll be right there.

65
00:05:29.413 --> 00:05:30.747
You must be safe.

66
00:05:31.373 --> 00:05:33.500
Please be safe.

67
00:05:45.554 --> 00:05:46.597
Useless fool!

68
00:05:46.638 --> 00:05:50.058
It's very easy to dodge
continuous straight-line attacks.

69
00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:52.186
It's also very easy
to determine your location.

70
00:05:54.771 --> 00:05:57.566
It's the same for me.

71
00:05:57.691 --> 00:06:00.235
Even if you turn invisible,

72
00:06:00.569 --> 00:06:02.487
I can completely see through you!

73
00:06:10.662 --> 00:06:12.789
Very interesting.

74
00:06:13.832 --> 00:06:14.833
You...

75
00:06:15.125 --> 00:06:17.544
Even if you don't die,
don't come out without thinking.

76
00:06:22.966 --> 00:06:24.092
What's the matter again?

77
00:06:25.469 --> 00:06:26.970
What are you doing?

78
00:06:27.012 --> 00:06:28.180
The ball is coming!

79
00:06:36.563 --> 00:06:37.731
That girl...

80
00:06:39.149 --> 00:06:40.275
Lady Tamayo.

81
00:06:52.037 --> 00:06:53.413
This girl...

82
00:06:53.664 --> 00:06:55.040
This girl...

83
00:06:55.374 --> 00:06:58.919
I can't believe that
she can kick my ball back.

84
00:06:59.127 --> 00:07:00.629
She really doesn't know
what's good for her!

85
00:07:20.566 --> 00:07:22.317
You troublemaker!

86
00:07:25.779 --> 00:07:27.114
Amazing.

87
00:07:27.406 --> 00:07:29.366
Lady Tamayo, this is...

88
00:07:29.491 --> 00:07:32.828
I just used the ordinary
recovery medicine.

89
00:07:33.328 --> 00:07:34.955
It's a medicine for demons.

90
00:07:37.416 --> 00:07:39.626
It doesn't make them stronger.

91
00:07:40.127 --> 00:07:42.421
That's Nezuko's own power.

92
00:07:43.297 --> 00:07:45.215
Without relying on eating humans,

93
00:07:45.215 --> 00:07:47.176
her own power...

94
00:07:48.802 --> 00:07:50.804
is quickly growing.

95
00:08:02.482 --> 00:08:04.860
But her opponent is very strong too.

96
00:08:05.194 --> 00:08:06.361
If she uses all her power,

97
00:08:06.403 --> 00:08:08.238
Nezuko wouldn't be able
to defeat her.

98
00:08:09.615 --> 00:08:12.993
I must do something.

99
00:08:16.663 --> 00:08:18.707
What an interesting girl.

100
00:08:18.749 --> 00:08:21.835
From now on, I'm going
to deal with you seriously.

101
00:08:22.336 --> 00:08:25.214
I want to see how long
you can hang on.

102
00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:31.178
Ms. Twelve Demon Moons.

103
00:08:31.512 --> 00:08:32.596
Don't bother me!

104
00:08:32.596 --> 00:08:34.473
You defector, go away!

105
00:08:34.890 --> 00:08:37.351
Please let me ask you one thing.

106
00:08:38.185 --> 00:08:41.396
Do you know who Kibutsuji really is?

107
00:08:42.898 --> 00:08:44.441
What do you mean?

108
00:08:44.566 --> 00:08:48.070
That man is just a coward.

109
00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:51.114
He's been afraid of something.

110
00:08:51.490 --> 00:08:52.699
Stop it.

111
00:08:52.699 --> 00:08:54.243
Stop talking!

112
00:08:54.993 --> 00:08:58.372
Do you know the reason
why demons can't stay together...

113
00:08:59.623 --> 00:09:02.417
and why they kill each other?

114
00:09:03.544 --> 00:09:05.420
In order to prevent demons...

115
00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:08.215
from gathering together
and attacking him,

116
00:09:09.299 --> 00:09:11.802
Kibutsiji is using that...

117
00:09:12.678 --> 00:09:14.179
to control all of you.

118
00:09:14.805 --> 00:09:16.598
Shut up.

119
00:09:16.682 --> 00:09:18.350
Shut up!

120
00:09:18.433 --> 00:09:20.894
He's not as insignificant
as you said!

121
00:09:22.479 --> 00:09:26.108
Lady Tamayo is using a spell.

122
00:09:27.734 --> 00:09:30.445
No one can compare to his power!

123
00:09:30.612 --> 00:09:32.239
He's stronger than anyone!

124
00:09:32.364 --> 00:09:33.991
Lord Kibutsuji is...

125
00:09:40.539 --> 00:09:43.166
You said his name.

126
00:09:45.627 --> 00:09:47.546
The curse will initiate.

127
00:09:50.632 --> 00:09:52.467
Magical Aroma of Daylight...

128
00:09:53.135 --> 00:09:55.554
weakens one's brain functions,

129
00:09:55.554 --> 00:09:59.308
making one unable to lie
and keep secrets.

130
00:10:00.392 --> 00:10:01.894
Its power is incredible.

131
00:10:02.186 --> 00:10:03.478
Lady Tamayo.

132
00:10:06.148 --> 00:10:07.858
Even if you're so pitiful,

133
00:10:08.984 --> 00:10:10.235
farewell.

134
00:10:13.697 --> 00:10:16.617
Please forgive me!

135
00:10:16.617 --> 00:10:20.537
Please, please forgive me!

136
00:11:48.208 --> 00:11:49.793
Is she dead?

137
00:11:51.086 --> 00:11:52.838
She'll die soon.

138
00:11:54.590 --> 00:11:56.091
This is a curse.

139
00:11:57.092 --> 00:11:59.970
Her body will be destroyed...

140
00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:02.389
by Kibutsuji's cells inside of her.

141
00:12:05.309 --> 00:12:06.560
Basically,

142
00:12:07.019 --> 00:12:09.438
battles betweens demons
is a waste of effort.

143
00:12:10.063 --> 00:12:11.356
It's meaningless.

144
00:12:11.899 --> 00:12:14.359
Because they're unable
to give a fatal blow.

145
00:12:15.569 --> 00:12:19.531
Only the sunlight and the swords of
the Demon Slayer Corps can do that.

146
00:12:22.534 --> 00:12:27.122
It's just that Kibutsuji can destroy
the demon's cells.

147
00:12:33.253 --> 00:12:35.714
Don't inhale Lady Tamayo's spell.

148
00:12:35.839 --> 00:12:37.674
It will harm human bodies.

149
00:12:37.883 --> 00:12:39.009
Understand?

150
00:12:40.135 --> 00:12:41.303
Tanjiro.

151
00:12:42.346 --> 00:12:45.974
She's not part
of the Twelve Demon Moons.

152
00:12:47.768 --> 00:12:51.396
The Twelve Demon Moons' eyeballs
are engraved with a number,

153
00:12:51.647 --> 00:12:53.148
but she doesn't have that.

154
00:12:54.233 --> 00:12:56.276
I'm afraid that the other demon...

155
00:12:56.276 --> 00:12:58.237
isn't part of
the Twelve Demon Moons either.

156
00:12:58.737 --> 00:13:00.072
They're too weak.

157
00:13:01.615 --> 00:13:02.866
Too weak?

158
00:13:02.908 --> 00:13:04.076
That's considered weak?

159
00:13:04.409 --> 00:13:07.204
Lady Tamayo can't be mistaken.

160
00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:11.416
However, there are
brainless demons like this...

161
00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.628
who dare to harm Lady Tamayo.

162
00:13:14.878 --> 00:13:16.964
Of course she'll have
this kind of karma.

163
00:13:21.176 --> 00:13:22.469
I hope this blood...

164
00:13:22.469 --> 00:13:26.974
can provide clues
to help me make the cure.

165
00:13:29.226 --> 00:13:31.645
I'll go and check on Nezuko...

166
00:13:32.187 --> 00:13:33.814
because I let her drink
some medicine,

167
00:13:33.814 --> 00:13:35.983
and she even inhaled the spell.

168
00:13:36.859 --> 00:13:38.151
I'm sorry.

169
00:13:39.987 --> 00:13:42.072
Stay here. Don't move around.

170
00:13:42.072 --> 00:13:43.532
I'll leave the rest to you.

171
00:13:43.657 --> 00:13:45.868
I don't want to leave Lady Tamayo.

172
00:13:45.868 --> 00:13:47.202
Not even half a step!

173
00:13:54.751 --> 00:13:56.920
The ball.

174
00:13:59.006 --> 00:14:00.507
The ball.

175
00:14:01.133 --> 00:14:02.885
The ball.

176
00:14:02.968 --> 00:14:09.975
(Slayer)

177
00:14:15.772 --> 00:14:16.982
The ball is here.

178
00:14:18.483 --> 00:14:20.360
Play with me...

179
00:14:22.321 --> 00:14:24.281
Play with me...

180
00:14:26.116 --> 00:14:28.243
She's just like a child,

181
00:14:29.369 --> 00:14:32.623
yet she killed many people.

182
00:14:51.141 --> 00:14:53.477
She was incited to think that she's
part of the Twelve Demon Moons.

183
00:14:53.769 --> 00:14:54.853
She was lied to,

184
00:14:55.145 --> 00:14:56.355
asked to battle,

185
00:14:56.980 --> 00:14:57.981
and then...

186
00:14:59.066 --> 00:15:01.151
killed by Kibutsuji's curse.

187
00:15:02.861 --> 00:15:04.321
She has no chance
of being saved at all.

188
00:15:06.323 --> 00:15:08.867
Not even her bones or her body
will remain after she dies.

189
00:15:12.829 --> 00:15:14.289
Is this their karma...

190
00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:15.749
for killing so many human lives?

191
00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:28.053
Kibutsuji.

192
00:15:28.637 --> 00:15:29.805
I can't believe that man...

193
00:15:30.347 --> 00:15:32.641
did such a thing to those
who admire him.

194
00:15:33.809 --> 00:15:36.311
He's the real demon.

195
00:15:51.326 --> 00:15:52.452
Lady Tamayo.

196
00:15:54.580 --> 00:15:55.873
Yushiro.

197
00:15:56.248 --> 00:15:57.791
Over here.

198
00:16:01.170 --> 00:16:03.172
It doesn't matter if you come.

199
00:16:03.297 --> 00:16:04.965
Come down if you want to.

200
00:16:05.632 --> 00:16:06.800
Yushiro.

201
00:16:06.925 --> 00:16:08.135
I was kidding.

202
00:16:09.136 --> 00:16:11.471
Please come over here, Tanjiro.

203
00:16:12.014 --> 00:16:13.015
Yes.

204
00:16:21.690 --> 00:16:22.941
Nezuko.

205
00:16:25.194 --> 00:16:26.904
Before morning comes,

206
00:16:27.070 --> 00:16:28.655
we move to this basement...

207
00:16:28.697 --> 00:16:30.032
where sunlight can't shine through.

208
00:16:31.992 --> 00:16:33.076
Nezuko?

209
00:16:39.041 --> 00:16:41.710
Get away from Lady Tamayo!

210
00:16:41.710 --> 00:16:43.128
That's so rude!

211
00:16:43.170 --> 00:16:44.922
Don't act this way, Yushiro.

212
00:16:45.297 --> 00:16:46.507
It's fine.

213
00:16:47.216 --> 00:16:48.217
Yes.

214
00:16:48.759 --> 00:16:50.636
Lady Tamayo is so gentle
and thoughtful.

215
00:16:50.928 --> 00:16:52.554
She's so beautiful.

216
00:16:55.891 --> 00:16:58.018
Don't do that.

217
00:16:58.185 --> 00:16:59.645
From the beginning,

218
00:16:59.645 --> 00:17:02.147
Nezuko has always acted this way.

219
00:17:02.689 --> 00:17:04.316
Is she all right?

220
00:17:05.108 --> 00:17:06.443
Don't worry.

221
00:17:06.527 --> 00:17:07.653
She's fine.

222
00:17:09.321 --> 00:17:10.948
I think she's treating you two...

223
00:17:10.948 --> 00:17:13.367
like the people in our family.

224
00:17:13.742 --> 00:17:14.785
Don't do that.

225
00:17:15.077 --> 00:17:16.286
Family?

226
00:17:17.412 --> 00:17:20.332
But Nezuko has been conditioned...

227
00:17:20.332 --> 00:17:22.793
to treat humans as family.

228
00:17:23.502 --> 00:17:25.754
But we're demons.

229
00:17:25.879 --> 00:17:27.506
Don't do that.

230
00:17:28.048 --> 00:17:31.802
However, Nezuko thinks
that you're both humans.

231
00:17:32.135 --> 00:17:33.887
That's why she wants to protect you.

232
00:17:37.558 --> 00:17:41.395
I don't like the fact that Nezuko
has been conditioned.

233
00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:43.897
It seems like she has retained
her own consciousness.

234
00:17:43.939 --> 00:17:45.107
This is great.

235
00:17:47.067 --> 00:17:48.193
I'm sorry!

236
00:17:48.318 --> 00:17:49.403
Nezuko.

237
00:17:49.403 --> 00:17:51.446
Nezuko, let go!

238
00:17:51.488 --> 00:17:52.948
You're acting very rude!

239
00:17:54.700 --> 00:17:55.784
Thank you.

240
00:17:57.327 --> 00:17:58.662
Nezuko.

241
00:17:59.162 --> 00:18:00.455
Thank you.

242
00:18:11.383 --> 00:18:14.761
Even so, do you still want to live?

243
00:18:15.929 --> 00:18:20.642
Even if you're not human anymore,
do you still want to live?

244
00:18:22.561 --> 00:18:23.562
If you go on this way,

245
00:18:23.604 --> 00:18:26.190
I think you'll die sooner or later.

246
00:18:27.024 --> 00:18:30.360
However, not being human anymore...

247
00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:32.446
is very painful and sad.

248
00:18:34.072 --> 00:18:37.284
Even so, do you still want to live?

249
00:18:46.752 --> 00:18:49.171
We must leave this place.

250
00:18:50.964 --> 00:18:53.091
Because it's too close to Kibutsuji.

251
00:18:53.550 --> 00:18:55.385
If we don't hide quickly,

252
00:18:55.511 --> 00:18:56.970
it would be dangerous.

253
00:18:57.846 --> 00:19:00.933
And even if we intentionally
hide ourselves,

254
00:19:01.350 --> 00:19:04.269
I interact with humans as a doctor.

255
00:19:04.269 --> 00:19:06.480
Someone might notice
that I'm a demon.

256
00:19:06.855 --> 00:19:09.733
Children and senior citizens
are the most sensitive.

257
00:19:10.943 --> 00:19:12.110
Tanjiro.

258
00:19:12.528 --> 00:19:13.529
Yes.

259
00:19:13.987 --> 00:19:18.367
Let us take care of Nezuko.

260
00:19:21.411 --> 00:19:24.122
Even if I can't completely guarantee
that she'll be safe,

261
00:19:24.706 --> 00:19:27.960
it's better than you bringing her
to your battles.

262
00:19:32.130 --> 00:19:33.590
I guess she's right.

263
00:19:34.091 --> 00:19:35.300
Entrusting Nezuko to them...

264
00:19:35.342 --> 00:19:38.345
is better for Nezuko's sake indeed.

265
00:19:54.069 --> 00:19:55.153
Lady Tamayo.

266
00:19:55.153 --> 00:19:57.155
I really appreciate your kindness.

267
00:19:58.156 --> 00:19:59.157
However...

268
00:19:59.533 --> 00:20:01.285
We must be together.

269
00:20:02.119 --> 00:20:03.954
We won't be separated.

270
00:20:06.373 --> 00:20:08.417
We will never be apart again.

271
00:20:11.128 --> 00:20:12.421
All right.

272
00:20:12.838 --> 00:20:15.549
I wish you all the best.

273
00:20:15.883 --> 00:20:16.884
Goodbye.

274
00:20:17.593 --> 00:20:20.262
We must destroy all traces
before we leave.

275
00:20:20.721 --> 00:20:22.598
Leave now.

276
00:20:23.390 --> 00:20:24.391
Yes.

277
00:20:24.474 --> 00:20:25.559
So,

278
00:20:25.559 --> 00:20:27.603
Lady Tamayo and Yushiro,
please take care.

279
00:20:29.646 --> 00:20:31.148
Let's go, Nezuko.

280
00:20:34.109 --> 00:20:35.903
Don't be so impatient.

281
00:20:35.903 --> 00:20:36.904
Tanjiro!

282
00:20:40.699 --> 00:20:42.201
Your sister...

283
00:20:42.743 --> 00:20:43.952
is a beauty.

284
00:20:52.002 --> 00:20:56.715
South, southeast.

285
00:20:56.757 --> 00:21:00.427
The next destination
is south, southeast.

286
00:21:00.427 --> 00:21:02.679
All right, I got it.

287
00:21:02.679 --> 00:21:04.598
- Can you keep quiet?
- South, southeast.

288
00:21:04.598 --> 00:21:05.849
Please.

289
00:21:05.891 --> 00:21:07.809
I know already. Please!

290
00:21:07.809 --> 00:21:09.144
Please!

291
00:21:11.647 --> 00:21:13.607
Please!

292
00:21:13.607 --> 00:21:15.442
Marry me, okay?

293
00:21:15.484 --> 00:21:18.153
I don't know when I'll die.

294
00:21:18.362 --> 00:21:20.989
So I hope that you can marry me.

295
00:21:20.989 --> 00:21:23.867
Please!

296
00:21:23.992 --> 00:21:27.955
What's the matter with that person?

297
00:23:00.005 --> 00:23:01.006
(Demon Slayer)

298
00:23:03.008 --> 00:23:05.719
"South, southeast."

299
00:23:05.719 --> 00:23:08.597
I just finished a battle.
When exactly can I rest?

300
00:23:09.223 --> 00:23:10.516
What? Do I sound like him?

301
00:23:10.516 --> 00:23:12.184
I didn't intentionally imitate him.

302
00:23:13.268 --> 00:23:16.188
Now, let me tell you
a Taisho secret!

303
00:23:16.396 --> 00:23:19.441
All the Kasugai Crows in
the Demon Slayer Corps have names.

304
00:23:19.441 --> 00:23:23.195
I heard that mine is called
Tennoji Matsuemon.

305
00:23:23.820 --> 00:23:24.905
All right. Lastly,

306
00:23:24.905 --> 00:23:28.242
"This is your first task
as a demon slayer."

307
00:23:28.242 --> 00:23:29.993
From our very first task,

308
00:23:29.993 --> 00:23:31.662
we keep battling.

309
00:23:32.079 --> 00:23:34.581
Next, Episode 11, "Tsuzumi Mansion".

310
00:23:34.581 --> 00:23:36.750
Why won't the Demon Slayer Corps
let people rest?

311
00:23:37.626 --> 00:23:40.003
(To be continued)
