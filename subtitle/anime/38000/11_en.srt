1
00:00:00.918 --> 00:00:02.836
South, southeast.

2
00:00:02.836 --> 00:00:06.381
The next destination
is south, southeast.

3
00:00:06.381 --> 00:00:08.634
All right, I got it.

4
00:00:08.634 --> 00:00:10.636
- Can you keep quiet?
- South, southeast.

5
00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:11.803
Please.

6
00:00:11.887 --> 00:00:13.847
I know already. Please!

7
00:00:13.847 --> 00:00:15.182
Please!

8
00:00:17.684 --> 00:00:19.520
Please!

9
00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.605
Marry me, okay?

10
00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:24.191
I don't know when I'll die.

11
00:00:24.441 --> 00:00:27.110
So I hope that you can marry me.

12
00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:30.113
Please!

13
00:00:30.113 --> 00:00:34.284
What's the matter with that person?

14
00:00:56.932 --> 00:01:01.436
(Demon Slayer)

15
00:02:18.138 --> 00:02:20.933
(Episode 11: Tsuzumi Mansion)

16
00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:24.895
Please!

17
00:02:24.895 --> 00:02:26.522
I only have you.

18
00:02:26.522 --> 00:02:28.941
Only you can help me.

19
00:02:29.483 --> 00:02:30.901
Is that so? I understand.

20
00:02:31.151 --> 00:02:32.569
I will think of a solution.

21
00:02:35.072 --> 00:02:36.698
Please help me out.

22
00:02:36.698 --> 00:02:38.450
Marry me.

23
00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:39.993
I'm begging you.

24
00:02:41.036 --> 00:02:43.455
What are you doing
in the middle of the road?

25
00:02:43.664 --> 00:02:45.457
Can't you see she's unwilling?

26
00:02:45.457 --> 00:02:48.043
Also, please don't create trouble
for your sparrow.

27
00:02:48.877 --> 00:02:49.920
That uniform.

28
00:02:50.045 --> 00:02:52.506
You were in the Final Selection.

29
00:02:52.506 --> 00:02:54.842
There's no one with your attitude
among the people I know!

30
00:02:54.842 --> 00:02:55.843
I don't know you!

31
00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.136
We've met before!

32
00:02:58.178 --> 00:02:59.429
I'm sure we've met!

33
00:02:59.429 --> 00:03:02.182
Maybe you don't remember me now.

34
00:03:11.733 --> 00:03:13.527
It's all right now.

35
00:03:13.527 --> 00:03:15.571
Please go home safely.

36
00:03:15.696 --> 00:03:17.906
Okay, thank you very much.

37
00:03:19.074 --> 00:03:21.159
Stop spoiling things for us!

38
00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:22.911
That girl wants to marry me.

39
00:03:22.911 --> 00:03:24.580
She likes me!

40
00:03:26.665 --> 00:03:27.666
That hurts!

41
00:03:27.666 --> 00:03:29.543
It hurts. Stop hitting me.

42
00:03:29.585 --> 00:03:31.044
It hurts.

43
00:03:31.336 --> 00:03:32.671
Please calm down.

44
00:03:34.631 --> 00:03:37.467
Since when did I like you?

45
00:03:37.467 --> 00:03:40.095
I saw you crouching down
by the roadside by yourself...

46
00:03:40.095 --> 00:03:41.847
and just asked if you're okay!

47
00:03:42.973 --> 00:03:45.350
You talked to me
not because you like me,

48
00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:47.811
but you were just worried?

49
00:03:47.853 --> 00:03:50.647
I already have a fiancÃ©!

50
00:03:50.647 --> 00:03:52.191
It's impossible
for me to be with you!

51
00:03:52.191 --> 00:03:54.526
I see you're totally fine now!

52
00:03:54.526 --> 00:03:55.777
Goodbye!

53
00:03:56.486 --> 00:03:57.946
Wait.

54
00:03:57.946 --> 00:03:58.947
Wait...

55
00:03:58.947 --> 00:04:00.240
You should give up.

56
00:04:00.824 --> 00:04:02.534
Why did you interfere?

57
00:04:02.534 --> 00:04:04.536
You've got nothing to do with this!

58
00:04:05.287 --> 00:04:07.122
What kind of expression is that?

59
00:04:07.122 --> 00:04:08.540
Stop it!

60
00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:11.960
Why are you looking at me
as if I'm some funny creature?

61
00:04:13.128 --> 00:04:15.297
You owe me one!

62
00:04:15.297 --> 00:04:18.133
Because of you,
I couldn't get married!

63
00:04:22.679 --> 00:04:24.348
Can you say something?

64
00:04:24.348 --> 00:04:25.432
Listen up.

65
00:04:25.432 --> 00:04:26.975
I will most likely die...

66
00:04:26.975 --> 00:04:28.435
in my next mission.

67
00:04:28.727 --> 00:04:31.313
I am really weak.

68
00:04:31.313 --> 00:04:32.523
I'm telling you.

69
00:04:32.523 --> 00:04:35.609
You have to protect me
until I get married, got it?

70
00:04:36.443 --> 00:04:38.487
My name is Kamado Tanjiro.

71
00:04:38.487 --> 00:04:40.197
Is that so? Sorry.

72
00:04:40.197 --> 00:04:41.990
I'm Agatsuma Zenitsu.

73
00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:44.743
Please help me, Tanjiro.

74
00:04:45.327 --> 00:04:47.037
How can I help you?

75
00:04:47.204 --> 00:04:49.581
Why did you become
a swordsman, Zenitsu?

76
00:04:49.831 --> 00:04:51.875
Why are you being so useless?

77
00:04:51.875 --> 00:04:53.335
That is quite hurtful.

78
00:04:53.502 --> 00:04:56.046
Some woman cheated on my money.

79
00:04:56.255 --> 00:05:00.259
The old man who helped me
just happened to be a trainer.

80
00:05:00.259 --> 00:05:02.469
He kept training me every day,
it was like hell.

81
00:05:02.469 --> 00:05:04.888
I'd rather die!

82
00:05:04.888 --> 00:05:07.516
I thought I'd die
in the Final Selection.

83
00:05:07.516 --> 00:05:09.017
But I got lucky and survived.

84
00:05:09.017 --> 00:05:11.144
Now, it's like I'm living
in hell every day.

85
00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:14.481
It's so scary!

86
00:05:14.481 --> 00:05:17.276
I will be eaten by demons soon.

87
00:05:17.276 --> 00:05:20.779
They'll suck out my brain juice
through my ears!

88
00:05:20.779 --> 00:05:24.241
No way!

89
00:05:24.241 --> 00:05:27.536
Please save me!

90
00:05:27.619 --> 00:05:28.745
What's wrong with you?

91
00:05:28.745 --> 00:05:29.872
Are you okay?

92
00:05:48.098 --> 00:05:49.141
How are you?

93
00:05:50.517 --> 00:05:52.853
I'm hungry
now that I've calmed down.

94
00:05:53.145 --> 00:05:55.689
Didn't you bring food?

95
00:05:56.064 --> 00:05:57.191
No.

96
00:06:00.569 --> 00:06:02.821
Do you want this?

97
00:06:04.031 --> 00:06:06.283
Well, thank you.

98
00:06:12.039 --> 00:06:13.999
Tanjiro, you're not eating?

99
00:06:15.167 --> 00:06:16.710
That was my only food.

100
00:06:24.343 --> 00:06:25.344
Here.

101
00:06:25.344 --> 00:06:26.720
Let's split it in half.

102
00:06:27.346 --> 00:06:28.472
Is that okay?

103
00:06:28.472 --> 00:06:29.598
Thank you.

104
00:06:45.906 --> 00:06:49.451
Zenitsu, I understand
that you think demons are scary,

105
00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:51.828
but you shouldn't trouble
your sparrow.

106
00:06:52.829 --> 00:06:54.081
Trouble?

107
00:06:54.206 --> 00:06:55.249
Sparrow?

108
00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:56.625
How do you know that?

109
00:06:58.085 --> 00:07:01.129
You've been slacking off your work,

110
00:07:01.129 --> 00:07:05.217
hitting on any girl you see,
and you snore loudly.

111
00:07:05.217 --> 00:07:06.343
The sparrow said so.

112
00:07:08.262 --> 00:07:09.596
Did it really?

113
00:07:09.596 --> 00:07:11.682
You understand birds?

114
00:07:12.391 --> 00:07:13.475
That's a lie!

115
00:07:13.475 --> 00:07:14.977
You're just lying, right?

116
00:07:16.603 --> 00:07:19.022
Run!

117
00:07:19.022 --> 00:07:21.859
Tanjiro, Zenitsu, run!

118
00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:24.736
Hurry to the next destination,
both of you.

119
00:07:24.736 --> 00:07:28.657
Run now! Tanjiro, Zenitsu!

120
00:07:30.576 --> 00:07:34.830
What? The crow talked!

121
00:07:44.715 --> 00:07:46.383
Hey, Tanjiro.

122
00:07:46.592 --> 00:07:48.594
I don't think I can do this.

123
00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:52.806
Even if I'm there,
I'd be totally useless.

124
00:07:53.599 --> 00:07:56.143
The smell of demons
is getting stronger.

125
00:07:56.727 --> 00:07:58.395
Something must be going on
out front.

126
00:08:01.273 --> 00:08:02.441
That is...

127
00:08:10.908 --> 00:08:12.326
The smell of blood.

128
00:08:12.993 --> 00:08:14.953
But that smell...

129
00:08:15.996 --> 00:08:17.664
What smell are you talking about?

130
00:08:18.248 --> 00:08:20.459
I've never smelled
anything like this.

131
00:08:20.918 --> 00:08:22.002
Don't mind the smell.

132
00:08:22.002 --> 00:08:23.545
Do you hear that sound?

133
00:08:23.754 --> 00:08:27.049
Also, do we really
have to work together?

134
00:08:27.674 --> 00:08:28.717
Sound?

135
00:08:35.265 --> 00:08:37.267
There are children.

136
00:08:37.559 --> 00:08:38.727
What's the matter with them?

137
00:08:40.354 --> 00:08:43.440
What are you doing here?

138
00:08:49.363 --> 00:08:51.156
They seem so afraid.

139
00:08:52.658 --> 00:08:56.662
Let me show you something.

140
00:08:57.079 --> 00:08:58.622
Look.

141
00:08:59.248 --> 00:09:01.166
This sparrow is sitting in my hand.

142
00:09:04.169 --> 00:09:06.088
What do you think? Isn't it cute?

143
00:09:15.681 --> 00:09:18.475
Tell me what happened.

144
00:09:18.851 --> 00:09:20.310
Is that your house?

145
00:09:20.769 --> 00:09:22.521
No, it's not.

146
00:09:22.688 --> 00:09:23.772
That...

147
00:09:23.772 --> 00:09:24.898
That is...

148
00:09:25.524 --> 00:09:29.444
A monster's house.

149
00:09:32.614 --> 00:09:34.741
Our brother was taken away...

150
00:09:35.450 --> 00:09:37.160
when we were walking at night.

151
00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:39.746
I've never seen a monster before.

152
00:09:40.122 --> 00:09:43.458
It ignored us
and took our brother away.

153
00:09:44.918 --> 00:09:46.795
They went into that house, right?

154
00:09:49.756 --> 00:09:51.717
The two of you followed them here?

155
00:09:51.717 --> 00:09:52.759
Impressive.

156
00:09:52.843 --> 00:09:54.052
You're so brave.

157
00:09:55.721 --> 00:09:58.390
We followed the trail
of our brother's blood.

158
00:09:58.390 --> 00:09:59.933
Because he was injured.

159
00:10:01.143 --> 00:10:02.227
Injured?

160
00:10:03.437 --> 00:10:04.646
It will be all right.

161
00:10:04.730 --> 00:10:06.648
We will defeat the monster...

162
00:10:06.648 --> 00:10:08.066
and save your brother.

163
00:10:08.734 --> 00:10:10.861
Really?

164
00:10:12.237 --> 00:10:13.238
Yes.

165
00:10:14.323 --> 00:10:15.324
Tanjiro.

166
00:10:16.241 --> 00:10:18.744
What sound is that?

167
00:10:19.286 --> 00:10:22.206
I keep hearing something disturbing.

168
00:10:22.539 --> 00:10:24.583
Is it drums?

169
00:10:25.542 --> 00:10:26.752
There's a sound?

170
00:10:27.586 --> 00:10:28.795
What sound?

171
00:10:56.698 --> 00:10:57.866
Don't look!

172
00:11:00.035 --> 00:11:01.328
Are you okay?

173
00:11:03.247 --> 00:11:04.414
Are you okay?

174
00:11:04.665 --> 00:11:05.832
Hang in there!

175
00:11:07.125 --> 00:11:08.752
That wound is deep.

176
00:11:09.002 --> 00:11:10.128
This is...

177
00:11:10.879 --> 00:11:14.550
Escape...

178
00:11:17.344 --> 00:11:20.430
I finally escaped...

179
00:11:20.597 --> 00:11:25.060
I'm finally out of that hellhole...

180
00:11:26.353 --> 00:11:30.107
Am I dying?

181
00:11:30.232 --> 00:11:32.234
Will I die?

182
00:11:48.917 --> 00:11:50.335
He died.

183
00:11:51.378 --> 00:11:54.173
That must be so painful.

184
00:11:56.091 --> 00:11:57.217
Tanjiro.

185
00:11:57.426 --> 00:12:00.971
Don't tell me that's their brother?

186
00:12:27.539 --> 00:12:29.249
I couldn't save him.

187
00:12:30.918 --> 00:12:33.128
If only we had got here sooner.

188
00:12:33.545 --> 00:12:35.631
We might have saved his life.

189
00:12:38.342 --> 00:12:39.968
Is this guy your...

190
00:12:41.637 --> 00:12:43.305
He's not our brother.

191
00:12:44.097 --> 00:12:47.684
Our brother was wearing
a persimmon colored robe.

192
00:12:48.936 --> 00:12:50.020
Is that so?

193
00:12:50.145 --> 00:12:52.064
Seems like more than one person
was caught.

194
00:12:54.650 --> 00:12:57.569
I'll bury you later
when I come back.

195
00:12:58.403 --> 00:13:00.572
Forgive me.

196
00:13:01.823 --> 00:13:04.743
Let's go, Zenitsu.

197
00:13:09.706 --> 00:13:13.126
But we're the only people here
that can save them.

198
00:13:19.466 --> 00:13:20.717
Really?

199
00:13:20.884 --> 00:13:22.302
I understand.

200
00:13:24.555 --> 00:13:25.556
What?

201
00:13:25.556 --> 00:13:28.392
Why do you look like a ghost?

202
00:13:28.392 --> 00:13:30.769
I'm coming.

203
00:13:31.812 --> 00:13:34.106
I'm not going to force you.

204
00:13:34.690 --> 00:13:37.651
I'm coming.

205
00:13:41.572 --> 00:13:43.240
Just in case,

206
00:13:43.407 --> 00:13:44.867
I'll leave this box here.

207
00:13:45.158 --> 00:13:46.326
It'll protect you...

208
00:13:46.618 --> 00:13:48.328
if something bad happens.

209
00:13:48.787 --> 00:13:50.581
Okay, I'll be back soon.

210
00:14:22.946 --> 00:14:25.032
Tanjiro.

211
00:14:25.574 --> 00:14:27.451
Tanjiro.

212
00:14:27.534 --> 00:14:29.328
Will you protect me?

213
00:14:29.328 --> 00:14:32.206
You'll protect me, right?

214
00:14:33.916 --> 00:14:35.083
Zenitsu.

215
00:14:35.459 --> 00:14:37.211
I need to apologize.

216
00:14:37.669 --> 00:14:41.048
I broke my ribs and leg
in my last battle.

217
00:14:41.465 --> 00:14:43.759
I'm not fully recovered yet.

218
00:14:44.301 --> 00:14:45.302
So...

219
00:14:45.552 --> 00:14:48.096
What? Why did you break your bones?

220
00:14:48.096 --> 00:14:50.015
How could you break your bones?

221
00:14:50.015 --> 00:14:53.185
How can Tanjiro
with broken bones protect me?

222
00:14:53.185 --> 00:14:55.687
I'm going to die!

223
00:14:55.979 --> 00:14:57.731
What should I do now?

224
00:14:57.731 --> 00:14:58.815
I'm going to die!

225
00:14:58.815 --> 00:15:00.442
Die!

226
00:15:01.276 --> 00:15:03.445
That's too much!
How can you have broken bones?

227
00:15:03.445 --> 00:15:05.781
I'll die, 99 percent!

228
00:15:05.781 --> 00:15:07.157
I'm going to die!

229
00:15:07.157 --> 00:15:09.076
- Calm down, Zenitsu.
- I'm going to die!

230
00:15:09.076 --> 00:15:10.285
You're not going to die.

231
00:15:10.285 --> 00:15:12.955
Don't try to comfort me.

232
00:15:12.955 --> 00:15:13.997
No.

233
00:15:13.997 --> 00:15:16.083
I know you, Zenitsu...

234
00:15:16.625 --> 00:15:17.626
No!

235
00:15:19.169 --> 00:15:20.712
You can't come in here!

236
00:15:20.796 --> 00:15:25.008
Brother, the box was
making a weird sound.

237
00:15:25.050 --> 00:15:28.345
Even so, how could you
leave the box alone?

238
00:15:28.595 --> 00:15:31.598
That box is more precious
than my life, you know?

239
00:15:41.275 --> 00:15:42.860
Sorry, my bottom...

240
00:15:53.787 --> 00:15:55.247
The room changed.

241
00:15:55.622 --> 00:15:58.292
Wait, are we moving?

242
00:15:58.667 --> 00:16:00.502
We're moving
with the sound of the drum.

243
00:16:04.089 --> 00:16:06.800
Sorry that you got separated
from your brother.

244
00:16:07.259 --> 00:16:09.928
But I promise I'll protect you.

245
00:16:10.888 --> 00:16:13.515
And Zenitsu
will protect your brother.

246
00:16:13.557 --> 00:16:14.558
Don't worry.

247
00:16:15.225 --> 00:16:16.226
What's your name?

248
00:16:16.935 --> 00:16:18.228
Teruko.

249
00:16:18.770 --> 00:16:20.397
So, you're Teruko.

250
00:16:20.689 --> 00:16:22.357
That's a nice name you got there.

251
00:16:36.246 --> 00:16:37.915
Among all the smells,

252
00:16:38.207 --> 00:16:40.834
this is the stench
that's filling the whole mansion.

253
00:16:41.293 --> 00:16:43.045
He must have eaten a lot of people.

254
00:16:43.587 --> 00:16:46.840
He must be
the master of this mansion.

255
00:16:47.966 --> 00:16:50.052
Die!

256
00:16:50.093 --> 00:16:51.762
Die!

257
00:16:51.803 --> 00:16:53.096
I'm going to die!

258
00:16:53.096 --> 00:16:55.599
I'm separated from Tanjiro.

259
00:16:55.766 --> 00:16:58.393
Teruko.

260
00:16:58.393 --> 00:16:59.478
No.

261
00:16:59.478 --> 00:17:01.021
Don't shout!

262
00:17:01.021 --> 00:17:02.898
If the monsters hear you shouting,

263
00:17:02.898 --> 00:17:04.525
then we're really doomed.

264
00:17:04.525 --> 00:17:06.318
Let's get out of this place.

265
00:17:07.319 --> 00:17:08.695
Why should we get out?

266
00:17:08.946 --> 00:17:11.156
Are you trying
to escape by yourself?

267
00:17:11.949 --> 00:17:13.992
You kept saying you'll die.

268
00:17:13.992 --> 00:17:15.494
Don't you feel ashamed?

269
00:17:16.286 --> 00:17:17.746
You're holding on
to someone younger than you.

270
00:17:17.746 --> 00:17:19.790
Don't you feel embarrassed?

271
00:17:19.790 --> 00:17:23.335
Then why are you carrying
a sword on your waist?

272
00:17:26.338 --> 00:17:28.590
You're really hitting my weak point.

273
00:17:31.218 --> 00:17:32.427
It's not that!

274
00:17:32.427 --> 00:17:34.972
- It's because I'm useless.
- Let me go.

275
00:17:34.972 --> 00:17:37.474
- I want to get help from adults.
- Let me go.

276
00:17:37.474 --> 00:17:41.353
This situation cannot be handled
by children alone!

277
00:17:46.942 --> 00:17:49.152
It's a joke!

278
00:17:49.152 --> 00:17:51.071
This is the hallway!

279
00:17:51.113 --> 00:17:52.406
Where's the exit?

280
00:17:52.406 --> 00:17:53.657
I remember it was this door!

281
00:17:53.740 --> 00:17:54.825
Is it this?

282
00:17:55.367 --> 00:17:56.410
This?

283
00:17:56.577 --> 00:17:57.578
Is this it?

284
00:18:09.464 --> 00:18:13.635
Monster!

285
00:18:25.814 --> 00:18:26.899
What?

286
00:18:26.899 --> 00:18:27.900
What's that face?

287
00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:29.484
That's really annoying!

288
00:18:40.245 --> 00:18:42.080
If those guys...

289
00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:44.708
If only they didn't bother me.

290
00:18:46.460 --> 00:18:49.087
Teruko, try to stay quiet.

291
00:18:49.838 --> 00:18:51.089
This is a moving room.

292
00:18:51.089 --> 00:18:52.341
Don't go to the hallway.

293
00:18:52.382 --> 00:18:53.467
Stay back.

294
00:18:53.509 --> 00:18:55.302
Hide behind the cupboard.

295
00:19:01.016 --> 00:19:03.435
Darn it.

296
00:19:03.685 --> 00:19:06.230
It's those guys' fault
that I lost my prey.

297
00:19:06.563 --> 00:19:08.857
That prey was unique.

298
00:19:09.691 --> 00:19:11.109
Why?

299
00:19:11.151 --> 00:19:12.653
Whoever they are,

300
00:19:12.653 --> 00:19:15.656
they're intruders
who broke into my house.

301
00:19:15.906 --> 00:19:17.366
I'm furious.

302
00:19:17.616 --> 00:19:19.868
That prey was unique.

303
00:19:19.868 --> 00:19:22.079
I found and hunted him myself.

304
00:19:22.079 --> 00:19:23.997
That unique prey.

305
00:19:29.545 --> 00:19:31.213
Those guys.

306
00:19:31.630 --> 00:19:33.298
Those guys.

307
00:19:33.549 --> 00:19:35.133
Hey, listen up!

308
00:19:35.634 --> 00:19:38.428
I'm in the Demon Slayer Corps,
rank Mizunoto.

309
00:19:38.428 --> 00:19:40.097
I'm Kamado Tanjiro.

310
00:19:40.389 --> 00:19:42.307
I'm going to eliminate you today.

311
00:19:42.724 --> 00:19:46.395
That kid I found had rare blood.

312
00:19:51.024 --> 00:19:52.150
I got this.

313
00:19:58.198 --> 00:19:59.241
Teruko.

314
00:20:03.829 --> 00:20:05.414
The tatami became the wall?

315
00:20:05.831 --> 00:20:07.374
The room rotated.

316
00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.085
That's the Blood Demon Art
of this demon.

317
00:20:10.586 --> 00:20:13.505
This mansion is his territory.

318
00:20:15.132 --> 00:20:16.133
What?

319
00:20:16.258 --> 00:20:17.926
A strange smell
is approaching quickly.

320
00:20:18.510 --> 00:20:19.595
It's not a demon.

321
00:20:22.764 --> 00:20:25.767
Boar incoming!

322
00:20:25.934 --> 00:20:28.729
Boar incoming!

323
00:20:36.153 --> 00:20:37.696
What's wrong with that guy?

324
00:20:37.863 --> 00:20:39.781
He's wearing a boar hide.

325
00:20:43.911 --> 00:20:45.871
Are those Nichirin Blades?

326
00:20:49.124 --> 00:20:51.043
Monster.

327
00:20:51.043 --> 00:20:55.881
I'm going to shred you into pieces
to prove that I'm stronger...

328
00:20:55.923 --> 00:20:58.258
and climb up the ranks
of the Demon Slayer Corps.

329
00:20:59.009 --> 00:21:00.636
I'm angry.

330
00:21:00.844 --> 00:21:02.596
I'm furious.

331
00:21:04.515 --> 00:21:05.933
Here I come.

332
00:21:06.099 --> 00:21:09.269
Boar incoming!

333
00:22:39.902 --> 00:22:40.903
(Demon Slayer)

334
00:22:43.488 --> 00:22:44.573
Hey, Tanjiro.

335
00:22:44.781 --> 00:22:47.201
That girl you forced away
from me earlier,

336
00:22:47.201 --> 00:22:49.494
I still think that she likes me.

337
00:22:49.494 --> 00:22:50.787
What are you talking about?

338
00:22:50.787 --> 00:22:52.873
It's obvious that she hates you.

339
00:22:52.873 --> 00:22:54.082
That's impossible.

340
00:22:54.082 --> 00:22:55.167
How could you say that?

341
00:22:55.167 --> 00:22:57.336
Isn't she just waiting
for me to go after her?

342
00:22:57.336 --> 00:22:59.505
Now that I think of it,
when she slapped me,

343
00:22:59.505 --> 00:23:01.298
I felt some love.

344
00:23:01.298 --> 00:23:02.633
And when she kept on slapping me,

345
00:23:02.633 --> 00:23:04.593
each slap signifies her love for me.

346
00:23:04.593 --> 00:23:07.471
I'm very sure she's in love with me.

347
00:23:09.348 --> 00:23:10.849
Say something.

348
00:23:10.849 --> 00:23:13.268
Now, let me tell you
a Taisho secret!

349
00:23:13.477 --> 00:23:15.437
I heard Zenitsu
is head over heels for all girls.

350
00:23:15.479 --> 00:23:16.897
No matter who it is,

351
00:23:16.939 --> 00:23:18.649
he's passionate and he cares a lot.

352
00:23:18.649 --> 00:23:19.858
What can I do?

353
00:23:19.858 --> 00:23:22.986
That's because all girls
are cute and they all smell good.

354
00:23:23.612 --> 00:23:24.863
Speaking of girls,

355
00:23:24.863 --> 00:23:26.782
it's making me think
of the girl from earlier.

356
00:23:26.782 --> 00:23:28.742
I'll go back to her
once I leave this freak house.

357
00:23:28.742 --> 00:23:30.077
I really want to see her.

358
00:23:30.244 --> 00:23:31.662
Next, Episode 12,

359
00:23:31.662 --> 00:23:34.456
"The Boar Bares Its Fangs,
Zenitsu Sleeps".

360
00:23:34.456 --> 00:23:37.167
Don't ignore me, Tanjiro!

361
00:23:37.167 --> 00:23:40.003
(To be continued)
