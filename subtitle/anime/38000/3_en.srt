00:00:10,302 --> 00:00:14,097
(Diary, Kamado Tanjiro)

2
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:30,113
Let's go.

3
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:50,676
(Demon Slayer)

4
00:02:05,042 --> 00:02:06,251
The Demon Slayer Corps...

5
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:09,588
has several hundred members.

6
00:02:10,214 --> 00:02:13,133
It's an organization
that isn't officially recognized...

7
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:14,218
by the government.

8
00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:17,638
It has existed since ancient times,

9
00:02:17,638 --> 00:02:19,556
and even today,
we continue to hunt demons.

10
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:25,062
However, it's still a mystery...

11
00:02:25,062 --> 00:02:27,147
who the leader
of the Demon Slayer Corps is.

12
00:02:28,106 --> 00:02:29,316
Demons.

13
00:02:29,942 --> 00:02:31,902
Their primary diet is human flesh.

14
00:02:32,361 --> 00:02:34,488
They kill humans before eating them.

15
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:38,325
No one knows when and where
these demons came to be.

16
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:40,536
They are physically very strong...

17
00:02:40,744 --> 00:02:43,163
and their wounds heal
in the blink of an eye.

18
00:02:43,914 --> 00:02:46,041
Any flesh that is cut off is
still linked to their body.

19
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:49,086
In fact, they can even regenerate
new hands and feet...

20
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:51,338
and change their body structures.

21
00:02:51,505 --> 00:02:53,340
There are also demons
who have special powers.

22
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:55,342
Only sunlight...

23
00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:58,846
or decapitating the demons
with a special blade...

24
00:02:58,846 --> 00:02:59,847
can kill them.

25
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:04,768
The Demon Slayer Corps
face the demons with their bodies,

26
00:03:05,227 --> 00:03:06,603
but because they're only humans,

27
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:08,605
their wounds heal a lot slower,

28
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:11,567
and their hands and feet
can't regrow once they're lost.

29
00:03:11,984 --> 00:03:14,486
Even so, they still fight
these demons...

30
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:17,114
in order to protect the human race.

31
00:03:21,577 --> 00:03:24,288
(Episode 3: Sabito and Makomo)

32
00:03:31,003 --> 00:03:32,880
I'm a trainer.

33
00:03:33,589 --> 00:03:36,175
Like the literal meaning of
the term, I train swordsmen.

34
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,677
There are countless trainers
out there...

35
00:03:39,011 --> 00:03:40,637
who cultivate swordsmen
in their own area,

36
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:44,141
with their own methods.

37
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,476
To join the Demon Slayer Corps,

38
00:03:46,602 --> 00:03:48,854
you must survive
the Final Selection...

39
00:03:48,854 --> 00:03:52,357
that is held at Fujikasane Mountain.

40
00:03:52,858 --> 00:03:55,402
I'm the one who will decide...

41
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:56,862
your participation
in the Final Selection.

42
00:03:58,405 --> 00:03:59,865
For Nezuko,

43
00:04:00,157 --> 00:04:02,701
I'll write a diary starting today.

44
00:04:03,452 --> 00:04:05,454
I'll go down the mountain
to practice today too.

45
00:04:06,205 --> 00:04:08,081
I have to train hard...

46
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:09,625
so that I won't die
in the Final Selection.

47
00:04:13,921 --> 00:04:16,507
After going down the mountain
and training every day,

48
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:19,927
I have gotten better
at avoiding traps.

49
00:04:20,761 --> 00:04:22,554
My physical strength has improved...

50
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:25,432
and my sense of smell is
sharper than before.

51
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:27,726
So I'm able to detect scents
even better.

52
00:04:29,853 --> 00:04:31,063
But...

53
00:04:33,065 --> 00:04:35,484
the difficulty of the traps
keeps increasing.

54
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:39,238
He's definitely trying to kill me.

55
00:04:51,542 --> 00:04:54,378
Today, I had to descend the mountain
with a sword.

56
00:04:54,837 --> 00:04:57,047
It was a big hindrance.

57
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:02,302
With an extra object in my hand,

58
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:04,555
I kept falling into the traps.

59
00:05:06,515 --> 00:05:07,891
991...

60
00:05:07,891 --> 00:05:10,227
- I practiced swordplay today.
- 992, 993...

61
00:05:10,227 --> 00:05:11,937
Although I say "today",

62
00:05:11,937 --> 00:05:13,522
I've actually been practicing it
every day lately.

63
00:05:14,231 --> 00:05:15,691
After I finish practicing
going down the mountain,

64
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:17,860
I practice with my sword
until my arms are about to break.

65
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:19,236
1,000!

66
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:21,697
Do it another 500 times!

67
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:38,964
Swords break very easily.

68
00:05:40,382 --> 00:05:41,717
He told me this
at the very beginning.

69
00:05:42,885 --> 00:05:44,928
Swords are able
to withstand vertical forces,

70
00:05:45,262 --> 00:05:47,055
but not horizontal forces.

71
00:05:48,974 --> 00:05:52,728
So you must apply the force
vertically on the blade.

72
00:05:53,604 --> 00:05:54,938
The direction of the blade...

73
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:57,691
and the direction of the force
you use when swinging the sword...

74
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,985
must be exactly the same.

75
00:06:00,652 --> 00:06:02,863
Otherwise, the sword
will get damaged.

76
00:06:02,905 --> 00:06:03,906
In other words,

77
00:06:03,906 --> 00:06:05,699
if your sword breaks,

78
00:06:06,116 --> 00:06:08,327
your bones will also
break along with it.

79
00:06:08,577 --> 00:06:10,078
I felt a little threatened.

80
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:15,292
Nezuko...

81
00:06:15,667 --> 00:06:17,544
I'll do my best!

82
00:06:33,769 --> 00:06:35,979
It felt like I was
in a falling ceremony today.

83
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:37,981
I had to train
on how to fall safely...

84
00:06:38,023 --> 00:06:39,358
and get back up quickly...

85
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:41,652
no matter what
the circumstances are.

86
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:44,279
I had my sword in my hand...

87
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:47,032
and charged at Master Urokodaki.

88
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:48,700
He was empty-handed...

89
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:51,578
and completely unarmed,

90
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:56,750
but he was unbelievably good!

91
00:06:57,292 --> 00:07:00,963
He was able to fling me
to the ground every time.

92
00:07:05,884 --> 00:07:07,803
I'm back, Nezuko!

93
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:18,814
Today,

94
00:07:18,814 --> 00:07:21,733
I learned breathing techniques
and something like breathing forms.

95
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:24,695
Total Concentration Breathing?

96
00:07:25,696 --> 00:07:26,905
Yes.

97
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:28,198
Also,

98
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,702
I'll be passing on the 10 forms
of Water Breathing to you.

99
00:07:32,744 --> 00:07:34,329
Concentrate on taking long breaths,

100
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:36,540
like you're letting the oxygen...

101
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:38,709
into all the cells
in every part of your body.

102
00:07:39,084 --> 00:07:41,503
This helps enhance
your body's healing power...

103
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:44,840
and also stabilizes
and stimulates your mind.

104
00:07:45,674 --> 00:07:48,218
Relax your upper body...

105
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:51,263
and keep your lower body grounded.

106
00:07:51,763 --> 00:07:53,599
Okay, breathe!

107
00:07:58,604 --> 00:07:59,855
You've got it wrong!

108
00:08:01,857 --> 00:08:03,692
Next, practice your breathing forms.

109
00:08:04,109 --> 00:08:06,028
Yes! Is it like this?

110
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:07,070
No!

111
00:08:07,112 --> 00:08:09,072
- Is this right?
- You're wrong.

112
00:08:09,072 --> 00:08:12,326
- How about this?
- No.

113
00:08:12,367 --> 00:08:15,370
He scolded me, saying that
my abdomen was too weak...

114
00:08:15,412 --> 00:08:17,372
and punched me in the stomach
several times.

115
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:22,669
Then, he told me to merge
and become one with the water.

116
00:08:23,045 --> 00:08:24,588
Hurry up and get in!

117
00:08:30,135 --> 00:08:33,597
Nezuko!

118
00:08:38,769 --> 00:08:40,479
Nezuko!

119
00:08:40,604 --> 00:08:43,273
I am water!

120
00:08:46,151 --> 00:08:49,530
Also, Nezuko has already
been in a coma...

121
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:51,073
for more than half a year.

122
00:08:52,157 --> 00:08:55,202
Master Urokodaki had a doctor
take a look at her right away,

123
00:08:55,619 --> 00:08:57,037
but he said there was nothing wrong.

124
00:08:58,163 --> 00:09:01,667
It's strange
that she remains asleep.

125
00:09:06,505 --> 00:09:07,840
I'm so scared.

126
00:09:08,966 --> 00:09:10,259
What if I wake up one morning...

127
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:11,885
and find Nezuko dead?

128
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:13,595
What should I do then?

129
00:09:15,013 --> 00:09:18,100
There isn't a day that goes by
that I'm not afraid.

130
00:09:26,775 --> 00:09:28,861
I started training and going down
more dangerous mountains...

131
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:31,238
with thinner air.

132
00:09:38,453 --> 00:09:40,163
There were several times...

133
00:09:40,289 --> 00:09:41,707
when I thought I would die.

134
00:09:58,765 --> 00:10:01,810
There's nothing else
I can teach you now.

135
00:10:02,895 --> 00:10:04,855
A year after I arrived
at Sagiri Mountain,

136
00:10:05,314 --> 00:10:06,857
he suddenly said that to me.

137
00:10:08,609 --> 00:10:10,736
You'll have to rely on yourself
from now on.

138
00:10:10,903 --> 00:10:12,988
Let's see if you can apply
and enhance the skills...

139
00:10:12,988 --> 00:10:14,907
that I've taught you.

140
00:10:19,161 --> 00:10:20,454
Come with me.

141
00:10:38,722 --> 00:10:40,974
If you can slice
this boulder in half,

142
00:10:41,016 --> 00:10:44,144
I'll allow you to participate
in the Final Selection.

143
00:10:48,857 --> 00:10:50,234
A boulder?

144
00:10:51,235 --> 00:10:52,611
Is that even something
that can be sliced open?

145
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,405
Can a sword break that open?

146
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,824
I don't think I can do it.

147
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:00,077
The sword will break.

148
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:06,875
Master Urokodaki!

149
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:08,418
Please wait!

150
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:09,962
Master Urokodaki!

151
00:11:11,588 --> 00:11:14,591
After that,

152
00:11:15,133 --> 00:11:17,177
he didn't teach me anything else.

153
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:44,454
Every day,

154
00:11:44,496 --> 00:11:48,000
I repeatedly practiced everything
I learned from my master.

155
00:11:55,257 --> 00:11:58,427
Fortunately, I recorded the secrets
of breath-holding and flexibility...

156
00:11:58,427 --> 00:12:00,929
in my diary.

157
00:12:10,898 --> 00:12:13,609
However, even after half a year,

158
00:12:14,151 --> 00:12:15,777
I still couldn't slice that boulder.

159
00:12:16,653 --> 00:12:17,988
This made me anxious.

160
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:19,448
It's not enough!

161
00:12:19,573 --> 00:12:21,366
I still haven't trained enough!

162
00:12:21,867 --> 00:12:23,285
I have to work harder!

163
00:12:23,535 --> 00:12:24,661
I have to do more!

164
00:12:32,628 --> 00:12:35,297
Do I just not have the ability?

165
00:12:36,423 --> 00:12:38,550
Is Nezuko going to die
just like that?

166
00:12:40,844 --> 00:12:41,929
I'm losing hope.

167
00:12:41,929 --> 00:12:43,013
I'm about to admit defeat.

168
00:12:44,932 --> 00:12:46,016
I have to try my best!

169
00:12:46,016 --> 00:12:47,392
I have to!

170
00:12:48,477 --> 00:12:49,478
Be quiet!

171
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,110
A man shouldn't be whining
and screaming.

172
00:12:57,194 --> 00:12:58,403
It makes you look ugly.

173
00:12:58,946 --> 00:13:00,280
Where did he come from?

174
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,615
I couldn't smell him at all.

175
00:13:01,782 --> 00:13:03,116
He's wearing a fox mask...

176
00:13:03,825 --> 00:13:06,787
No matter how much pain you're in,
you have to bear it.

177
00:13:07,538 --> 00:13:09,414
If you're a man...

178
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:13,293
If you were born as a man...

179
00:13:22,177 --> 00:13:23,470
Slow-witted.

180
00:13:23,512 --> 00:13:24,721
Weak.

181
00:13:24,763 --> 00:13:25,931
Immature.

182
00:13:27,558 --> 00:13:29,977
You're not considered a man.

183
00:13:41,822 --> 00:13:42,823
You just came out of the blue.

184
00:13:42,823 --> 00:13:43,949
What do you want?

185
00:13:44,408 --> 00:13:46,952
I'm the one who should ask
what you want.

186
00:13:47,703 --> 00:13:48,704
What else?

187
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:50,080
I want to train, of course!

188
00:13:50,497 --> 00:13:53,458
How much longer are you going
to just sit on the ground like that?

189
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,210
You're not alert at all.

190
00:13:59,256 --> 00:14:00,257
All right.

191
00:14:00,257 --> 00:14:01,550
Go ahead and attack me.

192
00:14:02,259 --> 00:14:03,260
But...

193
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:04,636
You're holding a wooden sword.

194
00:14:04,636 --> 00:14:06,221
Mine is a real sword!

195
00:14:21,195 --> 00:14:23,197
Goodness.

196
00:14:23,197 --> 00:14:26,074
I'm so grateful
that you're worried about me.

197
00:14:26,575 --> 00:14:30,495
Do you actually think
you'll hurt me?

198
00:14:33,123 --> 00:14:35,542
You can rest assured.

199
00:14:35,667 --> 00:14:37,586
I'm more powerful than you...

200
00:14:37,878 --> 00:14:39,922
because I can slice
that boulder in half!

201
00:14:40,506 --> 00:14:42,049
You've sliced that boulder?

202
00:14:59,441 --> 00:15:01,735
You haven't learned a thing.

203
00:15:01,902 --> 00:15:04,279
You haven't turned
those skills into your own.

204
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:08,742
Especially the breathing style
you learned from Master Urokodaki.

205
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:11,203
Total Concentration Breathing.

206
00:15:12,746 --> 00:15:14,248
He knows Master Urokodaki?

207
00:15:15,123 --> 00:15:16,208
He even knows
about breathing styles.

208
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:20,128
You've only memorized
all of that knowledge,

209
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:23,799
but your body
hasn't learned anything.

210
00:15:25,133 --> 00:15:28,262
What have you been doing
for the past year and a half?

211
00:15:30,806 --> 00:15:33,517
I'm going to smack
all of those things into your body!

212
00:15:34,268 --> 00:15:37,688
Again!

213
00:15:37,855 --> 00:15:39,940
I'm going to make sure
you never forget...

214
00:15:39,982 --> 00:15:43,110
all the valuable skills
Master Urokodaki passed on to you!

215
00:15:43,485 --> 00:15:46,113
Watch me pummel all of those things
into every bone in your body!

216
00:15:46,113 --> 00:15:47,155
I practiced!

217
00:15:47,823 --> 00:15:49,533
I've been practicing every day!

218
00:15:49,575 --> 00:15:51,118
I've put my all into it!

219
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:53,579
But nothing's working.

220
00:15:54,204 --> 00:15:57,291
I can't improve any further.

221
00:15:57,833 --> 00:15:58,834
You better improve!

222
00:15:58,834 --> 00:16:00,252
If you're a man...

223
00:16:00,502 --> 00:16:02,337
If you were born as a man!

224
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:04,590
Improving yourself is
the only path you have!

225
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,091
Attack with all your might!

226
00:16:06,383 --> 00:16:09,052
Show me your ability!

227
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:28,071
I'll leave the rest to you.

228
00:16:41,168 --> 00:16:42,544
Are you okay?

229
00:16:45,172 --> 00:16:46,715
Did you see everything just now?

230
00:16:48,091 --> 00:16:49,760
That strike was amazing!

231
00:16:49,843 --> 00:16:51,803
He moves with no hesitation at all.

232
00:16:52,429 --> 00:16:53,972
It was beautiful!

233
00:16:54,515 --> 00:16:56,475
I want to become like that.

234
00:16:56,642 --> 00:16:57,684
Can I do it?

235
00:16:57,684 --> 00:16:58,852
Can I be like him?

236
00:17:01,355 --> 00:17:02,773
You definitely can.

237
00:17:02,981 --> 00:17:05,025
Because I'll watch over you.

238
00:17:09,947 --> 00:17:11,490
She's so cute...

239
00:17:12,574 --> 00:17:14,409
Who are you?

240
00:17:16,495 --> 00:17:19,581
The girl's name was Makomo.

241
00:17:20,249 --> 00:17:21,416
She told me that...

242
00:17:21,667 --> 00:17:23,377
the young boy's name was Sabito.

243
00:17:24,378 --> 00:17:28,131
Makomo pointed out my flaws to me.

244
00:17:29,091 --> 00:17:31,134
She also helped me correct things
like my unnecessary moves...

245
00:17:31,385 --> 00:17:33,428
and bad habits.

246
00:17:34,638 --> 00:17:36,598
Why is she helping me?

247
00:17:36,974 --> 00:17:38,725
I asked her where she was from,

248
00:17:38,767 --> 00:17:40,227
but she wouldn't tell me.

249
00:17:41,895 --> 00:17:45,899
We love Master Urokodaki.

250
00:17:46,567 --> 00:17:49,778
That was Makomo's favorite phrase.

251
00:17:50,904 --> 00:17:52,489
The two of them
aren't real siblings.

252
00:17:53,031 --> 00:17:54,283
Apparently,

253
00:17:54,283 --> 00:17:56,451
Master Urokodaki adopted them
as they were both orphans.

254
00:17:57,327 --> 00:18:00,372
There are other kids here too.

255
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:03,208
Everyone has been watching you.

256
00:18:04,793 --> 00:18:07,921
Makomo is kind of strange.

257
00:18:08,922 --> 00:18:11,008
She tends to speak with ambiguity.

258
00:18:12,384 --> 00:18:14,553
Total Concentration Breathing...

259
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:16,763
allows the blood flow
in your body...

260
00:18:17,014 --> 00:18:19,308
and your heart rate to speed up.

261
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,185
Because of that,

262
00:18:21,185 --> 00:18:23,020
your body temperature also rises...

263
00:18:23,478 --> 00:18:26,732
and makes even a human
as strong as a demon.

264
00:18:27,608 --> 00:18:30,736
It increases
the size of your lungs...

265
00:18:31,528 --> 00:18:34,990
and let in much more air
into your blood.

266
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,075
When your blood is stimulated,

267
00:18:37,576 --> 00:18:41,496
the bones and muscles will rapidly
heat up and give you more strength.

268
00:18:42,456 --> 00:18:44,333
I don't understand at all.

269
00:18:45,334 --> 00:18:47,419
Then, what do I have to do
to accomplish all that?

270
00:18:50,839 --> 00:18:52,549
Train with all the effort you have.

271
00:18:52,841 --> 00:18:56,762
I don't think
there is any other way.

272
00:19:00,057 --> 00:19:03,227
I felt like my hands and feet
were going to break into pieces.

273
00:19:03,894 --> 00:19:06,980
My lungs and my heart
were going to explode.

274
00:19:07,272 --> 00:19:08,774
I practiced
swinging my sword endlessly.

275
00:19:09,566 --> 00:19:10,651
Even so...

276
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:13,779
I still couldn't beat Sabito.

277
00:19:16,532 --> 00:19:19,284
Half a year has passed
just like that.

278
00:19:27,668 --> 00:19:28,752
That day,

279
00:19:29,044 --> 00:19:30,462
I went to challenge Sabito.

280
00:19:31,004 --> 00:19:32,923
Sabito was waiting for me
with a real sword in his hand.

281
00:19:33,549 --> 00:19:35,342
After half a year,

282
00:19:36,927 --> 00:19:38,804
you finally have
the expression of a man.

283
00:19:47,145 --> 00:19:48,647
I must defeat you today!

284
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:58,824
Dueling face-to-face is simple.

285
00:19:59,575 --> 00:20:02,703
The person who is stronger
and faster wins.

286
00:20:15,799 --> 00:20:17,467
The duel ended
in the split of a moment.

287
00:20:19,511 --> 00:20:20,554
On this day...

288
00:20:20,637 --> 00:20:21,972
At this moment...

289
00:20:22,431 --> 00:20:25,559
My blade touched Sabito first.

290
00:20:36,528 --> 00:20:37,905
When I won...

291
00:20:38,989 --> 00:20:40,365
Sabito smiled.

292
00:20:41,408 --> 00:20:42,618
He looked like he was about to cry,

293
00:20:42,826 --> 00:20:44,119
yet happy at the same time.

294
00:20:44,786 --> 00:20:46,747
He looked at ease with that smile.

295
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:50,042
Tanjiro.

296
00:20:51,335 --> 00:20:52,711
You did really well.

297
00:20:53,003 --> 00:20:54,713
Don't forget what you did just now.

298
00:20:56,882 --> 00:20:58,967
You have to win, Tanjiro.

299
00:20:59,301 --> 00:21:00,677
You have to defeat him too.

300
00:21:07,518 --> 00:21:08,810
Before I knew it,

301
00:21:08,852 --> 00:21:10,687
Sabito had already disappeared.

302
00:21:13,607 --> 00:21:16,652
The sword I used
to slash Sabito's mask...

303
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:25,202
sliced the boulder...

304
00:21:26,119 --> 00:21:27,204
in half.

305
00:22:59,963 --> 00:23:00,964
(Demon Slayer)

306
00:23:05,177 --> 00:23:06,678
Yes, even I was shocked too!

307
00:23:06,678 --> 00:23:08,680
I can't believe I could split open
such a huge boulder!

308
00:23:08,805 --> 00:23:11,016
It's all because of
Sabito and Makomo's efforts.

309
00:23:11,016 --> 00:23:12,809
I really have to thank them.

310
00:23:14,228 --> 00:23:17,105
Now, let me tell you
a Taisho secret!

311
00:23:17,439 --> 00:23:19,900
Do you know why
Master Urokodaki wears a mask?

312
00:23:20,317 --> 00:23:21,318
I heard it's because...

313
00:23:21,318 --> 00:23:23,987
his appearance is
too gentle and friendly,

314
00:23:23,987 --> 00:23:25,781
so the demons would make fun of him.

315
00:23:25,948 --> 00:23:28,909
Sabito, Makomo, Master Urokodaki.

316
00:23:29,284 --> 00:23:31,870
I'll do the best I can...

317
00:23:31,912 --> 00:23:33,038
to turn Nezuko back into a human!

318
00:23:34,206 --> 00:23:37,084
Next, Episode 4, "Final Selection".

319
00:23:37,251 --> 00:23:39,837
(To be continued)
