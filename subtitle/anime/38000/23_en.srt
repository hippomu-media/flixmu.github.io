1
00:00:05,088 --> 00:00:06,840
Demon, come out now.

2
00:00:07,591 --> 00:00:09,468
Stop it!

3
00:00:09,843 --> 00:00:12,596
I have your favorite
fresh human blood here.

4
00:00:16,892 --> 00:00:19,895
(Destroy)

5
00:00:35,994 --> 00:00:40,624
(Demon Slayer)

6
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:59,953
(Episode 23: Hashira Meeting)

7
00:02:09,213 --> 00:02:10,714
What's wrong, demon?

8
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:12,090
Come on.

9
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:14,092
Don't you want to eat me?

10
00:02:22,059 --> 00:02:23,101
Mr. Iguro.

11
00:02:23,644 --> 00:02:25,354
You're suppressing him too much.

12
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:27,105
Please relax a little.

13
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:30,776
It's because he keeps moving
that I need to suppress him.

14
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,321
Kamado.

15
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:38,116
If you use your breathing techniques
when your lungs are compressed,

16
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:40,244
your blood vessels will rupture.

17
00:02:40,244 --> 00:02:41,620
He will rupture his blood vessels?

18
00:02:41,745 --> 00:02:44,289
That's good. It sounds amazing.

19
00:02:44,373 --> 00:02:45,415
Let's go!

20
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:46,416
Let his blood vessels rupture.

21
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:50,879
So pitiful.

22
00:02:51,755 --> 00:02:54,508
How could there be
such a fragile and sad child?

23
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:57,094
Namo Amitãbha.

24
00:03:11,066 --> 00:03:12,150
Kamado.

25
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:23,620
Nezuko!

26
00:03:35,716 --> 00:03:36,800
She's my sister!

27
00:03:37,092 --> 00:03:38,427
She's my little sister!

28
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:40,596
It's not Nezuko!

29
00:03:41,263 --> 00:03:43,724
I don't know why
she became like this.

30
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:10,334
Humans are all your family.

31
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:20,260
You must protect humans.

32
00:04:28,852 --> 00:04:32,773
Humans are what you need
to protect and save.

33
00:04:33,148 --> 00:04:34,483
You cannot hurt them.

34
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:37,778
You must not hurt them.

35
00:05:02,594 --> 00:05:03,929
What's wrong?

36
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:07,516
The female demon turned her head
away and ignored him.

37
00:05:07,933 --> 00:05:10,727
Despite being stabbed three times
by Mr. Shinazugawa...

38
00:05:10,853 --> 00:05:13,689
and presented a bloody arm,

39
00:05:13,689 --> 00:05:15,941
she held back and did not bite him.

40
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:20,654
This is enough to prove...

41
00:05:20,821 --> 00:05:24,157
that Nezuko will not attack humans.

42
00:05:29,288 --> 00:05:31,248
What's your intention, Tomioka?

43
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:33,584
Tanjiro.

44
00:05:35,711 --> 00:05:39,882
Even so, there will still be people
who have doubts about Nezuko.

45
00:05:41,258 --> 00:05:43,260
You have to prove them wrong.

46
00:05:43,802 --> 00:05:44,803
From now on,

47
00:05:45,554 --> 00:05:47,139
Tanjiro and Nezuko will fight...

48
00:05:47,139 --> 00:05:48,891
as members
of the Demon Slayer Corps...

49
00:05:49,266 --> 00:05:51,101
contributing to society.

50
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:56,982
What is this feeling?

51
00:05:57,691 --> 00:05:59,026
I'm feeling light as a feather.

52
00:05:59,818 --> 00:06:00,903
Is it his voice?

53
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,197
Is it because of his voice...

54
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:05,449
that I feel light as a feather?

55
00:06:07,201 --> 00:06:09,536
Fight the Twelve Demon Moons...

56
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,289
and prove yourself to everyone.

57
00:06:13,123 --> 00:06:15,959
Then whatever you say
will carry a lot of weight, Tanjiro.

58
00:06:21,131 --> 00:06:22,216
I...

59
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:26,470
Nezuko and I will defeat
the Twelve Demon Moons!

60
00:06:27,221 --> 00:06:29,181
Nezuko and I can do it!

61
00:06:29,556 --> 00:06:32,309
We'll slash away
the chain of sorrows!

62
00:06:34,603 --> 00:06:36,980
The present Tanjiro won't cut it.

63
00:06:37,272 --> 00:06:40,150
Let's talk again after you defeat
one of the Twelve Demon Moons.

64
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:42,778
Yes.

65
00:06:44,029 --> 00:06:45,447
I can't laugh out loud.

66
00:06:45,489 --> 00:06:46,740
No way!

67
00:06:47,282 --> 00:06:49,368
Of course, these Hashira members
of the Demon Slayer Corps...

68
00:06:49,493 --> 00:06:52,287
each have their own amazing talent.

69
00:06:53,288 --> 00:06:54,873
Through painstakingly
tough training...

70
00:06:54,873 --> 00:06:56,250
and going through
life and death situations,

71
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:57,584
they improved themselves.

72
00:06:58,085 --> 00:07:00,379
Only then are they able to defeat
the Twelve Demon Moons.

73
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:02,798
You have to bear that in mind.

74
00:07:03,465 --> 00:07:07,970
That is why the Hashira members
are respected.

75
00:07:08,095 --> 00:07:11,807
Tanjiro, you should also
mind your language.

76
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:14,393
Yes.

77
00:07:16,061 --> 00:07:18,146
Also, Sanemi,

78
00:07:18,522 --> 00:07:19,565
Obanai,

79
00:07:20,566 --> 00:07:23,402
don't be too hard on the children.

80
00:07:24,361 --> 00:07:25,404
Yes, sir.

81
00:07:28,991 --> 00:07:30,075
Yes, sir.

82
00:07:31,326 --> 00:07:33,954
That's it for Tanjiro's business.

83
00:07:34,746 --> 00:07:36,290
You may leave now.

84
00:07:38,292 --> 00:07:40,002
Please allow Kamado...

85
00:07:40,169 --> 00:07:42,796
to be in my care momentarily.

86
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:50,012
Okay, let's bring them over.

87
00:07:55,392 --> 00:07:57,644
Excuse me for my rudeness!

88
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,993
Let's begin the Hashira meeting...

89
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:16,246
Wait, don't run!

90
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:21,502
I wish that I could use my head...

91
00:08:21,543 --> 00:08:23,795
on that man with a body of scars.

92
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:25,005
I'll definitely...

93
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:26,590
Keep quiet! Shut your mouth!

94
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:29,885
I'll definitely make him pay
for stabbing Nezuko earlier!

95
00:08:30,177 --> 00:08:33,180
If I use my head, it won't be
breaking the rules, right?

96
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:35,390
Keep quiet. Please calm down!

97
00:08:35,557 --> 00:08:37,351
Let me go!

98
00:08:37,351 --> 00:08:38,435
Shut up!

99
00:08:45,275 --> 00:08:48,487
You shouldn't interrupt Lord Oyakata
when he's talking.

100
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:51,907
- I'm so sorry.
- I'm really sorry.

101
00:08:51,907 --> 00:08:52,991
Lord Oyakata.

102
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:53,992
Lord Tokito.

103
00:08:53,992 --> 00:08:56,161
- We are terribly sorry.
- Please forgive us.

104
00:08:56,161 --> 00:08:57,829
- Muichiro.
- I will guide him strictly.

105
00:08:57,871 --> 00:09:01,166
- He's such a man.
- Please forgive us.

106
00:09:01,834 --> 00:09:03,085
Send him off.

107
00:09:03,377 --> 00:09:04,503
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

108
00:09:08,465 --> 00:09:09,591
Tanjiro.

109
00:09:10,551 --> 00:09:12,594
Send my regards to Ms. Tamayo.

110
00:09:17,224 --> 00:09:18,475
Wait a minute.

111
00:09:18,517 --> 00:09:20,727
I heard him say Ms. Tamayo.

112
00:09:21,812 --> 00:09:23,772
Stop talking!

113
00:09:23,856 --> 00:09:25,858
You're the reason we got scolded!

114
00:09:25,858 --> 00:09:27,359
I nearly peed my pants!

115
00:09:28,694 --> 00:09:30,821
The Hashira members
are really scary.

116
00:09:30,821 --> 00:09:32,531
You should observe the surroundings!

117
00:09:32,614 --> 00:09:34,658
I'll never forgive you!

118
00:09:34,658 --> 00:09:36,243
Never!

119
00:09:36,368 --> 00:09:39,162
- Apologize!
- Apologize now!

120
00:09:40,539 --> 00:09:43,000
Sorry.

121
00:09:52,968 --> 00:09:55,053
Sorry for the intrusion.

122
00:09:57,306 --> 00:09:59,433
Sorry for the intrusion.

123
00:09:59,808 --> 00:10:00,851
Excuse me.

124
00:10:02,561 --> 00:10:04,813
No one is coming out.

125
00:10:05,981 --> 00:10:07,983
Let's go around
and take a look in the yard.

126
00:10:11,528 --> 00:10:13,238
Shouldn't you walk by yourself?

127
00:10:14,239 --> 00:10:15,407
Sorry.

128
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:18,619
My whole body hurts terribly.

129
00:10:21,538 --> 00:10:23,373
Although the headquarters are big,

130
00:10:23,999 --> 00:10:26,376
this is a magnificent house too.

131
00:10:30,005 --> 00:10:31,256
Speaking of which,

132
00:10:31,256 --> 00:10:33,675
this seems to be called
the Butterfly Estate.

133
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:41,350
There is someone.

134
00:10:42,476 --> 00:10:43,644
There is someone over there.

135
00:10:45,062 --> 00:10:47,523
She is...

136
00:10:47,731 --> 00:10:48,732
Right.

137
00:10:48,732 --> 00:10:50,108
She is a successor.

138
00:10:50,734 --> 00:10:52,361
Her name...

139
00:10:52,444 --> 00:10:53,820
A successor?

140
00:10:54,446 --> 00:10:56,198
She's Lady Tsuyuri Kanao.

141
00:11:03,413 --> 00:11:05,707
She's the girl I met
in the Final Selection.

142
00:11:06,792 --> 00:11:08,168
Did you forget...

143
00:11:08,377 --> 00:11:11,922
about being stepped on
by Lady Kanao last night?

144
00:11:13,882 --> 00:11:17,135
Successors are those members
personally trained by Hashira.

145
00:11:17,761 --> 00:11:20,681
It's impossible to be selected
unless you're very talented.

146
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:23,517
It's even more amazing
that she's a girl.

147
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:28,355
Sorry for bothering you,
Lady Tsuyuri.

148
00:11:28,981 --> 00:11:31,191
We came under the instructions
of Lady Kocho.

149
00:11:32,693 --> 00:11:34,862
Can we enter the mansion?

150
00:11:40,742 --> 00:11:42,828
Can we?

151
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:49,918
We can enter, right?

152
00:11:50,836 --> 00:11:52,087
Who are you?

153
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:54,464
That...

154
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:55,966
We came under the instructions
of Lady Kocho.

155
00:11:56,466 --> 00:11:58,093
Are you Kakushis?

156
00:11:58,760 --> 00:11:59,887
You're sending over the injured?

157
00:12:00,971 --> 00:12:02,097
This way, please.

158
00:12:02,806 --> 00:12:03,849
Yes.

159
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,684
She's fast.

160
00:12:14,359 --> 00:12:15,652
Five times?

161
00:12:15,777 --> 00:12:18,030
Do I need to eat these five times?

162
00:12:18,197 --> 00:12:20,782
Do I have to take these medicines
for three whole months?

163
00:12:20,782 --> 00:12:23,368
I can't eat rice
after taking these medicines.

164
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:25,245
They're so bitter!

165
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:27,414
And I'm really uncomfortable!

166
00:12:27,664 --> 00:12:30,584
Can my arms and legs recover
only by taking medicines?

167
00:12:30,584 --> 00:12:31,627
Really?

168
00:12:31,627 --> 00:12:33,086
- Tell me, is it true?
- Please keep quiet.

169
00:12:33,128 --> 00:12:36,298
- How can I cure it?
- Please explain it to me clearly!

170
00:12:36,381 --> 00:12:38,217
Please explain it to me!

171
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:41,345
- That guy is causing trouble again.
- Tell me what happens if I skip it.

172
00:12:41,345 --> 00:12:43,931
Tell me what will happen
to my arms and legs!

173
00:12:43,931 --> 00:12:45,224
Okay? Tell me what will happen!

174
00:12:45,224 --> 00:12:46,934
- Zenitsu.
- Tell me!

175
00:12:46,934 --> 00:12:48,810
Please keep quiet.

176
00:12:48,852 --> 00:12:50,270
Please!

177
00:12:50,395 --> 00:12:52,606
I've told you many times.

178
00:12:52,856 --> 00:12:54,149
If you're going to keep this up,

179
00:12:54,149 --> 00:12:55,484
I need to tie you down!

180
00:12:58,111 --> 00:12:59,821
I can't stand this.

181
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:02,741
Zenitsu!

182
00:13:04,201 --> 00:13:06,411
Are you okay? Did you get hurt?

183
00:13:07,079 --> 00:13:09,206
You went up the mountain too?

184
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:12,876
Tanjiro?

185
00:13:14,962 --> 00:13:16,880
Tanjiro!

186
00:13:16,922 --> 00:13:18,757
Listen to me.

187
00:13:19,049 --> 00:13:20,926
I was stung by this stinky spider.

188
00:13:20,926 --> 00:13:23,887
The poison made me hurt all over!

189
00:13:23,971 --> 00:13:27,474
And I keep getting scolded
by that girl.

190
00:13:27,558 --> 00:13:28,934
- This is the worst!
- Wait.

191
00:13:28,934 --> 00:13:31,270
Can you let go?
This has nothing to do with me.

192
00:13:33,105 --> 00:13:36,066
Zenitsu, did you shrink?

193
00:13:38,902 --> 00:13:40,988
That's because
I nearly became a spider.

194
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:44,199
My arms and legs became shorter.

195
00:13:44,491 --> 00:13:45,659
I see.

196
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:47,452
What about Inosuke?

197
00:13:47,828 --> 00:13:49,413
Have you seen Mr. Murata?

198
00:13:50,122 --> 00:13:52,499
I don't know who is Murata.

199
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:54,960
But Inosuke is beside me.

200
00:13:56,378 --> 00:13:57,546
It's really him.

201
00:13:58,338 --> 00:13:59,798
He's right beside you.

202
00:14:00,048 --> 00:14:01,508
I didn't even notice him.

203
00:14:05,095 --> 00:14:06,180
Inosuke.

204
00:14:06,263 --> 00:14:07,681
I'm glad you're safe.

205
00:14:09,975 --> 00:14:11,518
You're safe.

206
00:14:12,561 --> 00:14:13,645
I'm sorry.

207
00:14:13,645 --> 00:14:15,189
I couldn't save you.

208
00:14:17,816 --> 00:14:18,901
It's fine.

209
00:14:19,568 --> 00:14:20,986
Don't worry about it.

210
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:22,905
Tissue!

211
00:14:22,946 --> 00:14:26,742
- That voice. Is he really Inosuke?
- Wipe it off me!

212
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:30,787
It seems like his voice is broken.

213
00:14:32,497 --> 00:14:35,125
I don't know about the details,

214
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:38,170
but I think someone
grabbed his neck really hard.

215
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:42,090
Then he screamed like a ghost...

216
00:14:42,299 --> 00:14:43,842
which caused a fatal wound
to his throat.

217
00:14:44,343 --> 00:14:46,428
I don't know if he's depressed,

218
00:14:46,428 --> 00:14:48,972
but he became so gentle, it's funny.

219
00:14:52,267 --> 00:14:55,187
Why is your laugh so disturbing?

220
00:14:56,021 --> 00:14:57,022
What's wrong?

221
00:15:00,484 --> 00:15:01,693
Sorry.

222
00:15:01,985 --> 00:15:03,529
I'm too weak.

223
00:15:08,951 --> 00:15:10,452
You can do it, Inosuke!

224
00:15:10,661 --> 00:15:12,579
Being depressed doesn't suit you.

225
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:14,665
You're doing so well.

226
00:15:14,665 --> 00:15:15,832
You're amazing.

227
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:18,627
I'm really happy that you're alive.

228
00:15:19,878 --> 00:15:21,380
Have I taken the morning medicine?

229
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:22,506
Did anyone see me take it?

230
00:15:22,506 --> 00:15:23,632
Anyone?

231
00:15:23,757 --> 00:15:26,426
Did anyone see it? Anyone?

232
00:15:39,106 --> 00:15:40,190
Zenitsu.

233
00:15:40,649 --> 00:15:41,692
Inosuke.

234
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:46,280
I'm relieved that you're both alive.

235
00:16:08,051 --> 00:16:09,428
It's fine now.

236
00:16:10,137 --> 00:16:13,056
You can use this room, Nezuko.

237
00:16:16,518 --> 00:16:18,478
It hurts.

238
00:16:21,398 --> 00:16:24,735
I was injured badly
from the fight in Natagumo Mountain.

239
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:27,571
It's really painful.

240
00:16:28,197 --> 00:16:30,407
Honestly, it's extremely painful.

241
00:16:32,284 --> 00:16:33,327
Nezuko.

242
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:37,706
Thank you for saving me
in the mountains.

243
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:41,585
Not only Nezuko,

244
00:16:42,169 --> 00:16:43,504
but also Master Urokodaki...

245
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:44,922
and Mr. Tomioka.

246
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:49,718
They bet their lives on us.

247
00:16:51,303 --> 00:16:53,055
Everyone keeps taking care of us.

248
00:16:54,848 --> 00:16:55,933
I...

249
00:16:56,975 --> 00:16:58,727
need to become much stronger.

250
00:17:01,939 --> 00:17:03,065
Even today,

251
00:17:03,774 --> 00:17:06,360
Lord Oyakata helped me and Nezuko...

252
00:17:06,777 --> 00:17:08,779
and ultimately saved our lives.

253
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,741
That man's voice...

254
00:17:13,784 --> 00:17:15,744
is incredibly soothing.

255
00:17:17,246 --> 00:17:18,872
By listening to his voice alone...

256
00:17:19,623 --> 00:17:21,333
makes one feel light as a feather.

257
00:17:22,793 --> 00:17:24,336
What kind of person is he?

258
00:17:37,474 --> 00:17:38,517
Right.

259
00:17:38,892 --> 00:17:41,436
You didn't get enough sleep.

260
00:17:44,022 --> 00:17:46,066
Although it's painful and harsh,

261
00:17:46,859 --> 00:17:48,485
we have to work harder.

262
00:17:49,027 --> 00:17:50,153
It's because...

263
00:17:50,946 --> 00:17:52,865
I'll age sooner or later.

264
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:54,616
I will become...

265
00:17:55,158 --> 00:17:57,077
an old man and die.

266
00:17:58,787 --> 00:17:59,830
After that,

267
00:18:00,664 --> 00:18:02,875
you'll be by yourself, Nezuko.

268
00:18:05,502 --> 00:18:07,129
It will be too lonely, right?

269
00:18:07,838 --> 00:18:08,922
Nezuko.

270
00:18:11,592 --> 00:18:15,804
I will definitely
turn you back into a human.

271
00:18:23,228 --> 00:18:25,397
As you've reported,

272
00:18:25,898 --> 00:18:28,817
demons are getting
more harmful than ever.

273
00:18:29,526 --> 00:18:33,947
Human lives are being threatened
like never before.

274
00:18:34,865 --> 00:18:37,784
It seems like we have to expand
the Demon Slayer Corps.

275
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:39,369
What are your opinions?

276
00:18:40,913 --> 00:18:42,706
From the operations
in Natagumo Mountain,

277
00:18:42,748 --> 00:18:43,832
it's obvious that...

278
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:47,711
the quality of our members
has reduced unbelievably.

279
00:18:48,086 --> 00:18:49,713
They're almost useless in battle.

280
00:18:50,714 --> 00:18:53,300
Firstly, it's the trainers' fault
for having poor judgment.

281
00:18:54,301 --> 00:18:57,888
They should at least be able to tell
which members are fit for battle.

282
00:18:58,722 --> 00:19:01,558
That kid from this morning
seems to be quite useful.

283
00:19:02,476 --> 00:19:04,978
He gave Shinazugawa
a glorious headbutt.

284
00:19:05,103 --> 00:19:06,230
He seems promising.

285
00:19:08,649 --> 00:19:10,567
If we increase our manpower,

286
00:19:11,026 --> 00:19:13,820
it will be harder for us
to manage the organization.

287
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:18,534
Times are different from the past.

288
00:19:19,535 --> 00:19:22,829
Except for those who experienced
their loved ones getting killed...

289
00:19:23,622 --> 00:19:27,417
and those who are in the bloodline
of demon slayers,

290
00:19:27,668 --> 00:19:29,753
it will be cruel for us to expect...

291
00:19:30,212 --> 00:19:35,968
the same or greater determination
and results from other people.

292
00:19:36,343 --> 00:19:38,011
Anyway, that kid...

293
00:19:38,095 --> 00:19:41,515
met one of the Twelve Demon Moons
not long after he joined us.

294
00:19:41,932 --> 00:19:43,851
I feel he has some kind
of strong attraction.

295
00:19:44,017 --> 00:19:46,812
For those of us who rarely encounter
the Twelve Demon Moons,

296
00:19:47,104 --> 00:19:48,438
it's really admirable.

297
00:19:49,857 --> 00:19:50,941
You're right.

298
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:57,072
But since the Lower Moon Five demon
was acting so boldly,

299
00:19:57,364 --> 00:20:00,826
we can be certain that Muzan
is nowhere near Natagumo Mountain.

300
00:20:02,035 --> 00:20:03,829
It's the same as
the Asakusa incident.

301
00:20:04,246 --> 00:20:06,540
As he has something to hide,

302
00:20:06,748 --> 00:20:10,752
Muzan caused a commotion
to prevent our detection.

303
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:14,298
This is making me anxious.

304
00:20:16,717 --> 00:20:21,346
Yet these demons
are devouring humans as usual...

305
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:24,391
increasing their numbers
and living a long life.

306
00:20:25,142 --> 00:20:29,563
There's only one thing we can do
for the deceased.

307
00:20:31,231 --> 00:20:33,859
The Hashira members gathered here,

308
00:20:33,859 --> 00:20:35,319
I trust that you're the elites...

309
00:20:35,444 --> 00:20:40,824
after the First Breath users
from the Sengoku era.

310
00:20:42,075 --> 00:20:43,577
Uzui Tengen.

311
00:20:44,286 --> 00:20:45,996
Rengoku Kyojuro.

312
00:20:46,788 --> 00:20:48,248
Kocho Shinobu.

313
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:50,417
Kanroji Mitsuri.

314
00:20:51,001 --> 00:20:52,586
Tokito Muichiro.

315
00:20:53,629 --> 00:20:55,214
Himejima Gyomei.

316
00:20:55,964 --> 00:20:57,549
Shinazugawa Sanemi.

317
00:20:58,383 --> 00:20:59,718
Iguro Obanai.

318
00:21:00,469 --> 00:21:01,929
Tomioka Giyu.

319
00:21:03,597 --> 00:21:05,432
My dear swordsmen,

320
00:21:06,183 --> 00:21:08,727
I look forward to your performance.

321
00:21:19,029 --> 00:21:20,614
Kibutsuji Muzan.

322
00:21:21,448 --> 00:21:23,825
I'll defeat you no matter what.

323
00:21:25,702 --> 00:21:28,330
You'll be defeated by us.

324
00:23:00,005 --> 00:23:01,048
(Demon Slayer)

325
00:23:02,299 --> 00:23:03,759
A demon who doesn't attack humans?

326
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,219
I still don't believe it.

327
00:23:05,511 --> 00:23:06,929
This is a miracle, isn't it?

328
00:23:07,012 --> 00:23:08,096
Speaking of miracles,

329
00:23:08,263 --> 00:23:11,600
we don't have a clue
where Kibutsuji Muzan is now.

330
00:23:11,725 --> 00:23:13,477
That's a miracle
at the scale of a thousand years.

331
00:23:14,728 --> 00:23:17,231
It's nice to hear
these exaggerated ideas from you.

332
00:23:17,481 --> 00:23:19,775
Now, let me tell you
a Taisho secret!

333
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:21,151
Lord Oyakata...

334
00:23:21,151 --> 00:23:23,529
seems to be the 97th leader
