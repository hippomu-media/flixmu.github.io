1
00:00:42,543 --> 00:00:44,545
Rui!

2
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:47,130
Rui!

3
00:00:47,256 --> 00:00:48,841
What are you doing?

4
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:50,968
You can't go outside!

5
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:08,569
(Demon Slayer)

6
00:02:25,103 --> 00:02:27,981
(Episode 21: Against Corps Rules)

7
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,195
My body was really weak.

8
00:02:33,904 --> 00:02:35,155
I have always been like that
since I was born.

9
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:38,659
I have never even run.

10
00:02:39,785 --> 00:02:42,454
Even walking was difficult.

11
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:50,879
It was until Lord Muzan appeared.

12
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:56,093
Poor you.

13
00:02:56,343 --> 00:02:58,262
Let me save you.

14
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:06,854
My parents were not happy at all.

15
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:12,401
It's because
the stronger version of me...

16
00:03:13,235 --> 00:03:14,862
could never be exposed
to sunlight...

17
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:18,365
and had to survive on human flesh.

18
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,038
Why did things turn out like this?

19
00:03:25,414 --> 00:03:28,834
Look at what you did, Rui!

20
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:39,887
I once heard a great story.

21
00:03:43,682 --> 00:03:46,310
A dad tragically died...

22
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:48,645
saving his kid from drowning
in the river.

23
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:56,528
I was really touched.

24
00:03:56,987 --> 00:03:58,822
Such great fatherly love...

25
00:03:59,198 --> 00:04:00,616
and a strong family bond.

26
00:04:01,742 --> 00:04:03,577
The dad who died in the river...

27
00:04:04,036 --> 00:04:06,455
perfectly fulfilled his duty
as a dad.

28
00:04:07,915 --> 00:04:09,124
However,

29
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,752
why was my dad...

30
00:04:17,841 --> 00:04:22,387
My dad wanted to kill me.

31
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:25,724
All my mom did was cry...

32
00:04:26,141 --> 00:04:29,019
instead of protecting me
when I was about to be killed.

33
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,701
I guess it was all fake.

34
00:04:46,662 --> 00:04:50,082
The bond between us wasn't real.

35
00:04:52,793 --> 00:04:55,420
I'm sorry.

36
00:04:57,756 --> 00:04:59,216
She seems to be saying something.

37
00:05:00,259 --> 00:05:01,635
Is she still alive?

38
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:06,890
I'm sorry I didn't give you...

39
00:05:07,266 --> 00:05:08,642
a strong and healthy body.

40
00:05:10,352 --> 00:05:12,062
After my mom said that,

41
00:05:12,521 --> 00:05:14,064
she stopped breathing.

42
00:05:16,108 --> 00:05:17,234
She died.

43
00:05:18,902 --> 00:05:20,863
It's okay, Rui.

44
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:23,740
We'll die with you.

45
00:05:25,284 --> 00:05:27,244
As I was furious
that I was almost killed,

46
00:05:27,578 --> 00:05:29,830
I couldn't understand the meaning
behind my dad's words.

47
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:34,751
He had actually wanted to atone
for all my murder crimes...

48
00:05:35,127 --> 00:05:36,837
and die with me.

49
00:05:37,796 --> 00:05:39,047
At that moment,

50
00:05:39,423 --> 00:05:40,966
I suddenly realized...

51
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:49,141
what a real bond was.

52
00:05:49,975 --> 00:05:51,435
And yet, that night,

53
00:05:51,852 --> 00:05:54,021
I cut that bond with my own hands.

54
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:56,982
Even so,

55
00:05:58,108 --> 00:06:01,612
Lord Muzan still encouraged me.

56
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:07,159
The blame falls on your parents
for not accepting you.

57
00:06:07,576 --> 00:06:09,745
You should be proud of yourself
for being so strong.

58
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:12,956
Believing those words...

59
00:06:13,248 --> 00:06:14,750
was the only way...

60
00:06:15,417 --> 00:06:17,961
I could accept all those
irredeemable things I had done.

61
00:06:22,466 --> 00:06:25,552
Even though I clearly knew that
I had committed this sin,

62
00:06:34,228 --> 00:06:35,896
every single day,

63
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:39,399
I still couldn't stop
missing my parents.

64
00:06:41,068 --> 00:06:43,237
Even creating a pretend family...

65
00:06:43,779 --> 00:06:45,531
couldn't fill up the emptiness
inside me.

66
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:48,617
In the end,
because I was the strongest,

67
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:52,496
no one could protect me
or stand by my side.

68
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:55,165
As I grew stronger,

69
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:58,752
my memories as a human
gradually faded away.

70
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:02,214
I got more and more confused...

71
00:07:02,798 --> 00:07:04,591
about what I really wanted to do.

72
00:07:13,225 --> 00:07:14,434
Though I knew it was something
I couldn't have...

73
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:15,644
no matter what I did,

74
00:07:15,644 --> 00:07:17,104
I desperately tried
to reach out my hand...

75
00:07:17,271 --> 00:07:19,481
to find that bond I wanted,

76
00:07:19,898 --> 00:07:21,525
but I could never touch anything.

77
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:34,621
In that tiny body of his,

78
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:37,207
there's a scent of grief...

79
00:07:37,499 --> 00:07:39,293
that is too overwhelming
for him to bear.

80
00:07:57,186 --> 00:07:58,270
It's so warm.

81
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:02,191
His hand is as gentle
as the sunlight.

82
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:07,279
I remember everything now.

83
00:08:07,404 --> 00:08:08,739
Very vividly, in fact.

84
00:08:09,198 --> 00:08:11,116
I really want to apologize.

85
00:08:12,117 --> 00:08:13,327
I'm sorry.

86
00:08:14,161 --> 00:08:17,331
It was all my fault.

87
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:21,793
Please forgive me.

88
00:08:23,045 --> 00:08:24,129
But...

89
00:08:24,546 --> 00:08:26,632
I've killed a lot of people.

90
00:08:27,049 --> 00:08:28,717
I'll probably be sent
to the firepit, right?

91
00:08:30,135 --> 00:08:32,554
Dad, Mom, and I...

92
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:35,974
probably won't end up
in the same place, will we?

93
00:08:37,893 --> 00:08:39,478
That's not true.

94
00:08:41,396 --> 00:08:42,898
We'll go together...

95
00:08:43,398 --> 00:08:44,775
even if it's the fire pit.

96
00:08:49,571 --> 00:08:50,697
Rui.

97
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:53,617
Dad.

98
00:08:55,285 --> 00:08:56,411
Mom.

99
00:08:57,996 --> 00:08:59,039
Rui.

100
00:08:59,957 --> 00:09:01,834
We'll be together
no matter where we go.

101
00:09:12,177 --> 00:09:15,514
It was all my fault.

102
00:09:16,265 --> 00:09:17,766
I'm sorry.

103
00:09:18,809 --> 00:09:23,856
I'm sorry!

104
00:09:46,295 --> 00:09:49,506
Don't feel sorry for a demon
who devours humans.

105
00:09:50,299 --> 00:09:52,843
Even though he looked like a child,

106
00:09:53,552 --> 00:09:57,389
he was still an ugly monster
who lived for decades.

107
00:09:57,973 --> 00:10:00,893
In order to avenge
the people who were killed...

108
00:10:01,685 --> 00:10:04,062
and to prevent more people
from being harmed in the future,

109
00:10:04,897 --> 00:10:08,901
I'll keep slashing
the demons' necks relentlessly.

110
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:12,946
But as for those who were in agony
due to their identity as a demon...

111
00:10:13,322 --> 00:10:15,657
and those who regretted
their actions,

112
00:10:15,908 --> 00:10:17,534
I won't trample on them.

113
00:10:18,368 --> 00:10:20,370
It's because demons
were once humans too.

114
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:24,708
They were also humans just like me.

115
00:10:25,876 --> 00:10:28,045
Please get your feet off of him!

116
00:10:29,713 --> 00:10:32,049
He isn't some ugly creature.

117
00:10:32,841 --> 00:10:34,676
Demons are empty creatures.

118
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,678
They are miserable creatures.

119
00:10:50,108 --> 00:10:51,360
You are...

120
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,203
What?

121
00:11:05,582 --> 00:11:08,502
Why are you interfering,
Mr. Tomioka?

122
00:11:09,586 --> 00:11:13,257
You said it before that
you can't get along with demons.

123
00:11:13,423 --> 00:11:14,967
What is the meaning of this?

124
00:11:16,218 --> 00:11:17,511
This is why...

125
00:11:17,886 --> 00:11:20,180
people despise you.

126
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:50,002
Lady Kocho's antidote
sure is effective!

127
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:51,295
Yes.

128
00:11:51,295 --> 00:11:53,255
She was even able to develop it...

129
00:11:53,297 --> 00:11:54,715
the moment she observed
the situation.

130
00:11:55,257 --> 00:11:56,967
She's remarkable.

131
00:11:58,051 --> 00:11:59,261
He is too.

132
00:12:00,762 --> 00:12:02,055
You mean that guy?

133
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:04,683
Luckily, he defeated the demon.

134
00:12:04,892 --> 00:12:07,519
That helped to slow down
the poison circulation slightly.

135
00:12:09,104 --> 00:12:11,315
All right, that should do it.

136
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:13,692
Everything is going smoothly.

137
00:12:14,026 --> 00:12:15,986
We should be able to save everyone.

138
00:12:16,278 --> 00:12:19,198
But let's hurry up
and finish our job here.

139
00:12:19,364 --> 00:12:21,491
I want to leave this place
as soon as possible.

140
00:12:21,658 --> 00:12:22,826
That's right.

141
00:12:23,035 --> 00:12:24,286
This is because...

142
00:12:24,494 --> 00:12:26,663
it really stinks here.

143
00:12:35,005 --> 00:12:38,175
Mr. Tomioka, please move aside.

144
00:12:40,552 --> 00:12:41,720
People...

145
00:12:42,596 --> 00:12:44,389
People don't despise me.

146
00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:50,729
Right, I'm so sorry.

147
00:12:50,812 --> 00:12:53,607
You aren't even aware
that people don't like you.

148
00:12:53,732 --> 00:12:56,902
I've said too much. I'm so sorry.

149
00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:04,451
- Hey, kid.
- Yes!

150
00:13:04,868 --> 00:13:07,454
The thing you're hugging is a demon.

151
00:13:07,579 --> 00:13:09,748
That's very dangerous.
Please stay away from her.

152
00:13:10,249 --> 00:13:12,042
That's not it!

153
00:13:12,251 --> 00:13:13,877
No, you're right.

154
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:16,463
But she is my little sister.

155
00:13:16,713 --> 00:13:18,131
She's my little sister!

156
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:19,216
So...

157
00:13:20,634 --> 00:13:23,303
I see. That's so sad.

158
00:13:24,221 --> 00:13:25,264
Then...

159
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:27,140
I'll make it painless for her...

160
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:30,018
and use a gentle poison to kill her.

161
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:34,398
Can you still move?

162
00:13:36,066 --> 00:13:37,234
Even if you can't,

163
00:13:37,234 --> 00:13:38,402
find your strength and move.

164
00:13:39,194 --> 00:13:40,696
Hurry and escape with your sister.

165
00:13:41,613 --> 00:13:42,823
Mr. Tomioka.

166
00:13:43,907 --> 00:13:45,117
I'm sorry!

167
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,451
Thank you so much!

168
00:13:48,787 --> 00:13:51,623
Doing that is against corps rules.

169
00:14:03,802 --> 00:14:06,471
My whole body is in so much pain!
It's insufferable!

170
00:14:06,471 --> 00:14:08,098
It hurts a lot, I want to scream!

171
00:14:08,098 --> 00:14:09,266
I have to endure it!

172
00:14:10,058 --> 00:14:12,936
Keep going!

173
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:21,195
I suppose I have no choice,
but to quit the Demon Slayer Corps.

174
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:23,447
Though she's my sister,

175
00:14:23,655 --> 00:14:25,490
no one will approve
of a swordsman...

176
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:26,950
who brings a demon around with him.

177
00:14:30,996 --> 00:14:33,248
Are you serious, Mr. Tomioka?

178
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:36,293
I never imagined a Hashira
would side with a demon.

179
00:14:40,005 --> 00:14:41,798
Though that may be your intention,

180
00:14:41,965 --> 00:14:45,511
I'm not interested in wasting time
with you here.

181
00:14:45,969 --> 00:14:48,263
I wish you all the best.

182
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:01,818
Are you trying to catch up with me?

183
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:13,455
You can try to stop me if you want.

184
00:15:13,789 --> 00:15:16,375
But don't forget
there's still someone else.

185
00:15:24,007 --> 00:15:25,425
I can't stop running.

186
00:15:25,592 --> 00:15:27,052
I have to keep on moving!

187
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:29,721
I must run as far as I can!

188
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:39,189
Crap! What was that?

189
00:15:39,898 --> 00:15:41,733
I used up all my energy
by just running.

190
00:15:42,734 --> 00:15:43,819
Nezuko.

191
00:15:45,195 --> 00:15:46,405
The Demon Slayer Corps?

192
00:15:52,411 --> 00:15:53,912
Quickly run, Nezuko!

193
00:15:54,204 --> 00:15:56,206
Hurry and escape! Run!

194
00:15:56,373 --> 00:15:57,875
Don't get caught!

195
00:15:57,916 --> 00:15:59,126
Hurry!

196
00:16:09,636 --> 00:16:12,264
Her body shrunk
into the size of a child.

197
00:16:21,607 --> 00:16:24,693
All she's doing is running away
and not attacking me.

198
00:16:24,943 --> 00:16:26,111
Why is that?

199
00:16:29,531 --> 00:16:31,241
I don't need to think so much.

200
00:16:31,533 --> 00:16:34,077
I just need to follow orders
and slay this demon.

201
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,415
Mr. Tomioka.

202
00:16:38,874 --> 00:16:40,959
Are you listening to me,
Mr. Tomioka?

203
00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:43,128
I'm just trying to kill a demon,

204
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:45,672
so I think it was reasonable for me
to launch an attack.

205
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:48,300
I don't think I broke the rules.

206
00:16:49,051 --> 00:16:51,887
But your actions are surely
against corps rules...

207
00:16:52,513 --> 00:16:54,973
because you're obstructing
my demon-slaying mission.

208
00:16:55,557 --> 00:16:57,267
What exactly are you planning to do?

209
00:17:01,146 --> 00:17:03,649
Say something.

210
00:17:03,815 --> 00:17:05,817
This is the last chance
I'm giving you.

211
00:17:05,943 --> 00:17:08,111
At least, tell me your reason.

212
00:17:14,117 --> 00:17:17,037
I remember it happened two years go.

213
00:17:17,371 --> 00:17:19,248
Is it necessary
to start the story...

214
00:17:19,289 --> 00:17:20,958
from that long time ago?

215
00:17:20,958 --> 00:17:22,543
Are you annoying me on purpose?

216
00:17:22,876 --> 00:17:25,003
Does it still bother you...

217
00:17:25,295 --> 00:17:26,630
that I said people despise you?

218
00:17:31,718 --> 00:17:33,595
This is a command!

219
00:17:35,305 --> 00:17:37,140
This is an order from headquarters!

220
00:17:37,975 --> 00:17:39,643
Capture Tanjiro and Nezuko.

221
00:17:39,643 --> 00:17:43,021
Bring them back
to headquarters immediately!

222
00:17:45,858 --> 00:17:48,569
After catching Tanjiro
and the demon, Nezuko,

223
00:17:48,735 --> 00:17:51,154
take them
to headquarters immediately!

224
00:17:51,572 --> 00:17:55,158
Tanjiro is wearing
a checkered jacket...

225
00:17:55,242 --> 00:17:56,910
and has a scar on his forehead!

226
00:17:57,035 --> 00:18:00,038
The demon, Nezuko, is a young girl
wearing a bamboo mouthpiece!

227
00:18:00,205 --> 00:18:03,333
- Bring them back immediately!
- Are you Nezuko?

228
00:18:07,546 --> 00:18:10,007
Bring them back!

229
00:18:11,258 --> 00:18:14,136
Tanjiro is wearing
a checkered jacket...

230
00:18:14,136 --> 00:18:15,679
and has a scar on his forehead!

231
00:18:15,971 --> 00:18:19,183
The demon, Nezuko, is a young girl
wearing a bamboo mouthpiece!

232
00:18:19,433 --> 00:18:22,019
Bring them back!

233
00:18:25,564 --> 00:18:27,149
There's a scar on his forehead.

234
00:18:27,274 --> 00:18:28,859
Okay, let's arrest him.

235
00:18:29,943 --> 00:18:32,905
Is his jawbone broken?

236
00:18:34,364 --> 00:18:36,450
Poor guy. We have to tie him up too.

237
00:18:40,746 --> 00:18:41,914
What's with this guy?

238
00:18:42,039 --> 00:18:43,040
I don't know.

239
00:18:43,165 --> 00:18:45,083
I don't think he's a demon.

240
00:18:45,834 --> 00:18:47,085
Is he human?

241
00:18:47,794 --> 00:18:49,880
He's wearing our uniform.

242
00:18:51,507 --> 00:18:53,717
This is a mask. He's a human!

243
00:18:54,301 --> 00:18:56,094
All right, let's take him back.

244
00:18:57,554 --> 00:19:00,682
Gosh, this guy's injuries
are quite severe too.

245
00:19:00,891 --> 00:19:02,935
Why is he tied up there?

246
00:19:05,604 --> 00:19:07,648
I couldn't accomplish anything.

247
00:19:09,233 --> 00:19:10,859
On my own,

248
00:19:10,984 --> 00:19:13,529
I couldn't defeat a single demon.

249
00:19:15,822 --> 00:19:16,865
Maybe...

250
00:19:17,282 --> 00:19:19,243
I'm really not that strong.

251
00:19:28,502 --> 00:19:30,504
They wrapped me up in layers.

252
00:19:31,922 --> 00:19:33,340
Who are those people?

253
00:19:33,924 --> 00:19:36,885
They're taking care of everything
so efficiently.

254
00:19:37,719 --> 00:19:39,096
And that girl...

255
00:19:39,346 --> 00:19:41,515
Wasn't she the one
who was in the Final Selection?

256
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:44,434
Her hair clip looks the same
as the one on the girl...

257
00:19:44,434 --> 00:19:45,894
who bandaged us up.

258
00:19:46,937 --> 00:19:48,438
Should we send these people
to the Butterfly Estate as well?

259
00:19:48,564 --> 00:19:49,565
Yes.

260
00:19:49,648 --> 00:19:51,108
Send all of the wounded people
to our place.

261
00:19:51,608 --> 00:19:53,527
I'll hunt down any demons
who are around here.

262
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:55,112
Don't worry and keep working.

263
00:19:56,363 --> 00:19:58,282
Come to think of it,
I've heard about them.

264
00:19:58,490 --> 00:20:00,742
They're the clean-up brigade,
the Kakushi.

265
00:20:01,285 --> 00:20:02,995
They are a team that is responsible
for cleaning up...

266
00:20:02,995 --> 00:20:04,788
after battles between
the Demon Slayer Corps and demons.

267
00:20:05,956 --> 00:20:07,457
Its members are mostly people...

268
00:20:07,457 --> 00:20:10,752
who are lacking
in swordsmanship and talent.

269
00:20:11,879 --> 00:20:16,633
(Treatment Completed)

270
00:20:18,677 --> 00:20:19,845
It's daybreak.

271
00:21:05,516 --> 00:21:06,725
Get up.

272
00:21:07,893 --> 00:21:09,478
Hurry and get up.

273
00:21:10,187 --> 00:21:13,023
Get up. Hey!

274
00:21:13,565 --> 00:21:15,651
You brat! Hey!

275
00:21:15,984 --> 00:21:17,694
How much longer
are you going to sleep?

276
00:21:17,694 --> 00:21:19,321
Hurry and get up!

277
00:21:23,659 --> 00:21:25,410
The Hashira are in front of you!

278
00:22:59,922 --> 00:23:00,964
(Demon Slayer)

279
00:23:02,049 --> 00:23:05,761
We've been going on a lot
of missions together lately.

280
00:23:07,012 --> 00:23:08,889
Can you at least respond to me?

281
00:23:08,889 --> 00:23:12,643
Or are you still mad
that I said no one likes you?

282
00:23:14,061 --> 00:23:15,938
Can you just say something?

283
00:23:16,438 --> 00:23:18,482
Now, let me tell you
a Taisho secret!

284
00:23:18,607 --> 00:23:20,192
I heard Kocho is afraid...

285
00:23:20,234 --> 00:23:22,736
of cats, dogs, and other creatures
with fur all over them.

286
00:23:22,945 --> 00:23:25,989
Why is that nonsense
the first thing you choose to say?

287
00:23:26,114 --> 00:23:28,408
Since you're not denying it,
does that mean it's the truth?

288
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:31,453
It's because of your big mouth
that people despise you.

289
00:23:31,453 --> 00:23:33,121
- People...
- "...don't despise me."

290
00:23:33,121 --> 00:23:34,915
Please think
of something new to say.

291
00:23:35,374 --> 00:23:38,126
Next, Episode 22,
"Master of the Mansion".

292
00:23:38,126 --> 00:23:39,920
(To be continued)
