1
00:01:11,154 --> 00:01:15,617
(Demon Slayer)

2
00:02:32,236 --> 00:02:34,905
(Episode 4: Final Selection)

3
00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:37,699
The reason I won...

4
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,370
was because I can distinguish
the smell of the opening thread.

5
00:02:44,623 --> 00:02:46,375
When fighting someone,

6
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,836
as long as I notice his smell,

7
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:50,379
I can see the thread.

8
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:56,718
The thread will connect my sword
to my opponent's weakness.

9
00:02:57,052 --> 00:02:58,303
The moment I see the thread,

10
00:02:58,428 --> 00:02:59,555
it would become taut.

11
00:03:06,645 --> 00:03:08,856
It strongly guides my sword...

12
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:10,774
to cut through
my opponent's weakness.

13
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:33,839
Master Urokodaki.

14
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:40,012
I was originally not planning...

15
00:03:40,012 --> 00:03:42,014
to let you join the Final Selection.

16
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:47,811
Because I don't want to see children
losing their lives for it again.

17
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:52,816
I honestly thought you wouldn't
be able to break the boulder.

18
00:03:58,071 --> 00:03:59,907
You've worked really hard.

19
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:01,658
Tanjiro.

20
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:02,701
You're...

21
00:04:03,327 --> 00:04:04,912
an incredible child.

22
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,421
In the Final Selection,

23
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:16,423
you must survive and come back.

24
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:19,301
Your sister and I will be waiting
for you to come back.

25
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:33,607
What's going on?

26
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:34,691
There's so much food.

27
00:04:35,359 --> 00:04:37,986
This is to celebrate
the completion of your training.

28
00:04:38,362 --> 00:04:39,488
There's no need to be shy.

29
00:04:39,488 --> 00:04:40,531
Eat to your heart's content.

30
00:04:42,157 --> 00:04:43,492
Thank you.

31
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:49,873
Tanjiro.

32
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:53,418
This is all I can do for you.

33
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:55,170
Next,

34
00:04:55,254 --> 00:04:58,382
you must face hard and cruel days...

35
00:04:58,423 --> 00:05:00,926
that can't compare
to your training at all.

36
00:05:01,927 --> 00:05:04,137
So now,

37
00:05:04,513 --> 00:05:06,515
don't think of anything else,

38
00:05:06,515 --> 00:05:08,100
but rest well.

39
00:05:24,825 --> 00:05:25,909
Tanjiro.

40
00:05:27,786 --> 00:05:28,787
Yes.

41
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,665
Was the hotpot good?

42
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:33,333
Yes.

43
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,544
I haven't had such good food
for a long time.

44
00:05:36,795 --> 00:05:38,964
For a child
with a huge appetite like you,

45
00:05:38,964 --> 00:05:40,674
you get as much energy
as the amount of food you consume.

46
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:42,301
You'll also grow.

47
00:05:42,885 --> 00:05:45,429
However, demons are the same.

48
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,806
You must remember that well.

49
00:05:48,223 --> 00:05:50,392
Basically, demons grow...

50
00:05:50,392 --> 00:05:52,186
based on the number
of humans he eats.

51
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,313
The more humans he eats,

52
00:05:54,438 --> 00:05:55,898
the stronger he is?

53
00:05:57,065 --> 00:05:58,066
That's right.

54
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,693
His power increases,

55
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:01,320
enabling his body to transform.

56
00:06:01,403 --> 00:06:04,114
And there will be demons
who use evil powers.

57
00:06:10,245 --> 00:06:13,332
If your sense of smell heightens,

58
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:16,418
you can even smell how many humans
the demon has eaten.

59
00:06:19,421 --> 00:06:20,631
This is...

60
00:06:21,882 --> 00:06:23,926
This is called an evil-warding mask.

61
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:26,762
In order to protect you from harm,

62
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:28,805
I placed a spell on it.

63
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:31,350
Evil-warding mask.

64
00:07:01,547 --> 00:07:02,631
Nezuko.

65
00:07:09,721 --> 00:07:13,016
I'll surely come back here.

66
00:07:15,644 --> 00:07:17,563
You don't need to worry
about your sister.

67
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:20,065
I'll take the responsibility
of taking care of her.

68
00:07:20,732 --> 00:07:21,733
Yes.

69
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:22,943
Thank you.

70
00:07:26,029 --> 00:07:27,030
I'll get going.

71
00:07:27,239 --> 00:07:28,365
Master Urokodaki.

72
00:07:34,246 --> 00:07:36,373
Please say hi to Sabito
and Makomo for me.

73
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:39,751
Tanjiro.

74
00:07:40,294 --> 00:07:41,587
Why do you...

75
00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:45,174
know the names
of the children who have died?

76
00:07:56,727 --> 00:07:57,895
So beautiful.

77
00:07:58,061 --> 00:07:59,771
Why are there
so many wisteria flowers?

78
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:02,900
It's not the season
for flowers to bloom.

79
00:08:35,224 --> 00:08:36,725
I can't believe
there are so many people here.

80
00:08:38,727 --> 00:08:39,895
- Everyone.
- Everyone.

81
00:08:40,229 --> 00:08:41,355
- Thank you...
- Thank you...

82
00:08:41,355 --> 00:08:43,273
- for gathering here tonight...
- for gathering here tonight...

83
00:08:43,315 --> 00:08:44,858
- and joining the Final Selection...
- and joining the Final Selection...

84
00:08:45,234 --> 00:08:46,944
- of the Demon Slayer Corps.
- of the Demon Slayer Corps.

85
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:49,655
In Fujikasane Mountain,

86
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:52,241
there's a lot of demons
being captured alive...

87
00:08:52,241 --> 00:08:53,992
by the many demon slayers.

88
00:08:54,493 --> 00:08:56,662
Those demons are unable
to leave this place.

89
00:08:57,496 --> 00:09:00,290
That's because from the foot
of the mountain to the mountainside,

90
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:02,876
the wisteria flowers
that demons hate the most...

91
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:06,380
bloom all year.

92
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:09,258
But starting from here,

93
00:09:09,383 --> 00:09:11,802
because there are
no more wisteria flowers,

94
00:09:11,969 --> 00:09:13,512
demons are present.

95
00:09:14,179 --> 00:09:16,765
Surviving in this place
for seven days...

96
00:09:17,182 --> 00:09:21,353
will let you pass
the Final Selection.

97
00:09:22,646 --> 00:09:25,440
- Good luck.
- Good luck.

98
00:09:40,581 --> 00:09:41,707
Seven days?

99
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:43,709
I must only focus on surviving.

100
00:09:47,421 --> 00:09:49,548
Let's see after I get
through the night.

101
00:09:50,132 --> 00:09:51,383
When the sun rises in the morning,

102
00:09:51,383 --> 00:09:53,218
demons can't move about.

103
00:09:53,468 --> 00:09:55,387
So I can get some rest.

104
00:09:56,054 --> 00:09:57,639
That's why I must go east,

105
00:09:58,891 --> 00:10:01,226
to the place
where the sun rises first.

106
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:07,232
This smell...

107
00:10:07,274 --> 00:10:08,275
It's a demon...

108
00:10:08,525 --> 00:10:09,568
and it's nearby.

109
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:19,494
Where is it?

110
00:10:19,536 --> 00:10:20,579
Where will it come from?

111
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:22,956
I can't confirm
the direction of the smell.

112
00:10:24,249 --> 00:10:25,292
Up there...

113
00:10:35,469 --> 00:10:36,553
A demon.

114
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:43,810
You jerk.

115
00:10:45,604 --> 00:10:47,856
Don't come and snatch my food away.

116
00:10:48,232 --> 00:10:49,775
Go away!

117
00:10:49,775 --> 00:10:50,817
Who cares about you?

118
00:10:50,943 --> 00:10:51,985
You go away!

119
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:53,612
Two demons came at once.

120
00:10:54,112 --> 00:10:55,197
Can I deal with them?

121
00:10:55,906 --> 00:10:57,449
That's my prey!

122
00:10:57,449 --> 00:10:58,575
Shut up.

123
00:10:58,575 --> 00:11:00,827
Whoever gets him first wins.

124
00:11:07,459 --> 00:11:08,502
Don't be scared.

125
00:11:08,544 --> 00:11:10,212
Calm down and watch
their movements carefully.

126
00:11:10,504 --> 00:11:12,214
Think about your training.

127
00:11:12,506 --> 00:11:15,175
I haven't eaten a human
for a long time.

128
00:11:15,384 --> 00:11:16,552
Focus.

129
00:11:16,593 --> 00:11:17,678
Water Breathing!

130
00:11:23,308 --> 00:11:24,643
It's the smell of the thread.

131
00:11:28,146 --> 00:11:29,231
Fourth Form!

132
00:11:30,566 --> 00:11:31,733
Striking Tide!

133
00:11:41,493 --> 00:11:42,703
I killed them.

134
00:11:44,997 --> 00:11:46,498
I won against demons.

135
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:48,750
I became stronger indeed.

136
00:11:49,668 --> 00:11:51,753
My efforts in training
were not in vain.

137
00:11:52,337 --> 00:11:54,006
I learned everything.

138
00:12:01,889 --> 00:12:04,933
With the sword Master Urokodaki gave
for cutting off demons' necks,

139
00:12:05,434 --> 00:12:07,060
even their bones will be gone.

140
00:12:10,314 --> 00:12:12,232
The neck is the vital point
for demons.

141
00:12:12,691 --> 00:12:15,694
But using ordinary swords...

142
00:12:15,694 --> 00:12:17,362
cannot kill demons.

143
00:12:17,821 --> 00:12:18,864
So...

144
00:12:19,156 --> 00:12:20,699
What should I do
to kill demons then?

145
00:12:21,366 --> 00:12:23,285
The swords that
the Demon Slayer Corps use...

146
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:25,704
are made from special steel.

147
00:12:25,913 --> 00:12:28,665
It's the only weapon
that can kill demons.

148
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:30,959
It's called...

149
00:12:31,585 --> 00:12:33,295
a Nichirin Blade.

150
00:12:40,928 --> 00:12:42,387
May you reincarnate
and become humans soon.

151
00:12:47,184 --> 00:12:50,062
Where is that rotting smell
coming from?

152
00:12:51,897 --> 00:12:53,023
I didn't hear about this.

153
00:12:53,357 --> 00:12:54,983
I didn't hear about these things!

154
00:12:55,484 --> 00:12:56,485
What's the matter?

155
00:13:09,331 --> 00:13:11,500
What's that?

156
00:13:22,845 --> 00:13:24,179
Sabito, let me ask you.

157
00:13:25,764 --> 00:13:28,684
Do you think Tanjiro
can win against him?

158
00:13:30,769 --> 00:13:31,937
I don't know.

159
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:33,564
No matter how hard you work,

160
00:13:33,814 --> 00:13:35,691
it's never enough.

161
00:13:37,025 --> 00:13:38,193
You should know that very well.

162
00:13:38,485 --> 00:13:39,903
That's why you...

163
00:13:45,826 --> 00:13:48,161
Why is there such a huge
frightening form?

164
00:13:48,287 --> 00:13:49,955
No one told me about such a demon!

165
00:14:08,682 --> 00:14:09,892
He ate him.

166
00:14:35,876 --> 00:14:36,919
Don't be scared.

167
00:14:37,085 --> 00:14:39,630
Save him!

168
00:14:39,838 --> 00:14:41,798
I'm not useless anymore.

169
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:43,383
Make a move!

170
00:14:44,635 --> 00:14:45,761
Water Breathing!

171
00:14:45,969 --> 00:14:47,012
Second Form!

172
00:14:47,262 --> 00:14:48,388
Water Wheel!

173
00:14:57,814 --> 00:14:59,399
There it is again.

174
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:02,110
My cute fox.

175
00:15:02,653 --> 00:15:03,779
Again?

176
00:15:04,446 --> 00:15:05,906
Fox.

177
00:15:05,906 --> 00:15:08,700
What year is it now?

178
00:15:10,202 --> 00:15:11,870
It's the Taisho era.

179
00:15:12,704 --> 00:15:14,998
Taisho.

180
00:15:20,254 --> 00:15:22,005
The era name...

181
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:24,883
I can't believe that the era
has changed!

182
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:26,093
It changed again.

183
00:15:26,093 --> 00:15:28,178
While I was locked
in this awful place,

184
00:15:28,178 --> 00:15:29,972
the era changed!

185
00:15:31,223 --> 00:15:32,599
Unforgivable!

186
00:15:32,599 --> 00:15:34,643
I won't forgive him!

187
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:39,565
Urokodaki!

188
00:15:39,565 --> 00:15:41,400
How do you know Master Urokodaki?

189
00:15:41,692 --> 00:15:43,235
Of course I know him.

190
00:15:43,235 --> 00:15:46,113
Because Urokodaki was the one
who brought me here.

191
00:15:46,238 --> 00:15:49,116
I will never forget
what happened 47 years ago.

192
00:15:49,741 --> 00:15:52,536
Back then, he was still
a demon slayer...

193
00:15:52,536 --> 00:15:55,747
during the Edo period
in the Keio era.

194
00:15:55,747 --> 00:15:56,790
Demon slayer?

195
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:57,833
Edo period?

196
00:15:58,083 --> 00:15:59,084
You're lying.

197
00:15:59,334 --> 00:16:01,962
How can a demon live that long?

198
00:16:02,004 --> 00:16:06,133
The demons here are those who have
eaten only two or three people,

199
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:08,302
demons who got killed
during the selection,

200
00:16:08,427 --> 00:16:10,262
and demons who killed each other.

201
00:16:10,262 --> 00:16:11,263
That's all.

202
00:16:11,805 --> 00:16:15,058
But I've always lived...

203
00:16:15,642 --> 00:16:17,936
in the prison where
there are wisteria flowers.

204
00:16:17,936 --> 00:16:21,398
I've eaten a total of 50 humans,
you rascals.

205
00:16:22,191 --> 00:16:23,442
Fifty humans?

206
00:16:24,151 --> 00:16:25,777
Eleven...

207
00:16:25,944 --> 00:16:27,237
Twelve...

208
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:29,448
Thirteen.

209
00:16:30,324 --> 00:16:32,826
You're the fourteenth.

210
00:16:33,118 --> 00:16:34,703
What does that mean?

211
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:39,499
The number of Urokodaki's students
that I've eaten.

212
00:16:41,084 --> 00:16:44,713
I've decided to kill
all his students.

213
00:16:46,256 --> 00:16:47,591
Right.

214
00:16:47,633 --> 00:16:51,345
There were two people
that made me particularly impressed.

215
00:16:51,762 --> 00:16:53,138
Those two...

216
00:16:53,138 --> 00:16:55,599
He was a child whose hair color
was very rare.

217
00:16:55,599 --> 00:16:57,184
He was the strongest among them.

218
00:16:57,392 --> 00:16:59,353
His hair was pink in color...

219
00:16:59,478 --> 00:17:01,146
and he had a scar beside his mouth.

220
00:17:01,855 --> 00:17:05,526
The other one was a little girl
wearing floral clothes.

221
00:17:05,817 --> 00:17:07,945
She was very short
and she didn't have much power,

222
00:17:07,945 --> 00:17:09,738
but she was very fast.

223
00:17:11,573 --> 00:17:14,076
They were killed by this demon?

224
00:17:14,493 --> 00:17:16,620
But I even...

225
00:17:16,787 --> 00:17:18,038
That mask...

226
00:17:18,121 --> 00:17:19,748
is the mark.

227
00:17:19,748 --> 00:17:21,583
The fox mask is the mark.

228
00:17:22,417 --> 00:17:26,630
I remember the markings
of the masks Urokodaki made.

229
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:30,634
It has the same markings
as the Tengu mask that he wears.

230
00:17:31,218 --> 00:17:33,512
He said it's
an evil-warding mask, right?

231
00:17:33,637 --> 00:17:35,013
It's precisely because
they were wearing those masks...

232
00:17:35,013 --> 00:17:36,557
that they were eaten by me.

233
00:17:36,765 --> 00:17:38,767
They're all in my stomach.

234
00:17:38,767 --> 00:17:41,937
It's like Urokodaki
killed them himself.

235
00:17:43,814 --> 00:17:45,107
When I was talking
about these things,

236
00:17:45,107 --> 00:17:48,151
that little girl cried so hard
out of anger.

237
00:17:50,153 --> 00:17:51,780
But not long after,

238
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:54,408
her movements became shaky.

239
00:17:55,742 --> 00:17:59,162
So I broke her limbs, then...

240
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:07,504
Calm down, Tanjiro.

241
00:18:08,172 --> 00:18:09,715
Your breathing is a mess.

242
00:18:10,465 --> 00:18:11,758
It's all right.

243
00:18:11,758 --> 00:18:13,218
Don't think about
what happened to us.

244
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,024
While that guy is being eaten,

245
00:18:27,065 --> 00:18:28,400
I must escape.

246
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:42,623
Another student of Urokodaki
has died again.

247
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:48,420
I wonder how he feels
because his student...

248
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:50,214
won't go back alive.

249
00:18:50,255 --> 00:18:52,633
I wonder what his facial expression
would be.

250
00:18:55,385 --> 00:18:59,139
I really want to see it.

251
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:05,062
Tanjiro!

252
00:19:06,522 --> 00:19:07,689
Tanjiro!

253
00:19:10,317 --> 00:19:11,443
He moved away.

254
00:19:11,693 --> 00:19:13,403
I can't believe he can still move.

255
00:19:13,737 --> 00:19:16,156
This is worth my time.

256
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:24,331
Darn it.

257
00:19:24,414 --> 00:19:25,832
No matter how many times
I cut it off,

258
00:19:25,832 --> 00:19:27,668
he would grow more hands
after a short time.

259
00:19:28,126 --> 00:19:31,505
You can't defeat me
by cutting off my hands.

260
00:19:31,964 --> 00:19:33,131
I'll be honest with you.

261
00:19:33,131 --> 00:19:35,092
Even the pink-haired kid...

262
00:19:35,092 --> 00:19:37,261
couldn't cut off my neck.

263
00:19:48,105 --> 00:19:50,774
I can't just leave this demon here.

264
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:54,027
Before others lose their lives,

265
00:19:54,653 --> 00:19:57,239
I must defeat him here!

266
00:20:01,451 --> 00:20:03,662
I smell demons from the ground.

267
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,127
He jumped so high.

268
00:20:10,169 --> 00:20:11,670
I wasn't able to give him
a fatal blow.

269
00:20:12,171 --> 00:20:16,633
However, he can't escape
this attack in the air.

270
00:20:18,385 --> 00:20:21,263
Even Tanjiro won't be able
to defeat him?

271
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:24,600
That demon's neck is really hard.

272
00:20:26,268 --> 00:20:28,979
He might win or he might lose.

273
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:33,942
However, one thing is for sure.

274
00:20:35,819 --> 00:20:36,987
Tanjiro...

275
00:20:38,071 --> 00:20:39,698
is a man who broke...

276
00:20:39,948 --> 00:20:43,160
this big and hard boulder into half.

277
00:20:47,998 --> 00:20:49,333
He pushed my hand away.

278
00:20:52,085 --> 00:20:53,337
Total Concentration Breathing!

279
00:20:53,754 --> 00:20:55,047
Water Breathing!

280
00:21:00,302 --> 00:21:02,304
He's near me now.

281
00:21:03,096 --> 00:21:04,306
It's fine.

282
00:21:04,306 --> 00:21:05,641
My neck is very hard.

283
00:21:05,641 --> 00:21:07,226
He can't cut it off.

284
00:21:07,351 --> 00:21:08,644
First Form!

285
00:21:08,977 --> 00:21:10,979
As he fails to cut off my neck,

286
00:21:10,979 --> 00:21:13,232
see how I'll crush his head,

287
00:21:13,232 --> 00:21:15,817
just like those kids!

288
00:21:25,536 --> 00:21:27,162
Water Surface Slash!

289
00:23:00,005 --> 00:23:01,089
(Demon Slayer)

290
00:23:03,091 --> 00:23:04,301
Water Surface Slash!

291
00:23:04,426 --> 00:23:05,594
What do you think, Nezuko?

292
00:23:05,594 --> 00:23:07,137
I look very cool, right?

293
00:23:09,097 --> 00:23:10,098
What?

294
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:12,017
You're saying Sabito is cooler?

295
00:23:12,017 --> 00:23:13,977
No way, Nezuko.

296
00:23:15,229 --> 00:23:16,522
Oh right.

297
00:23:16,647 --> 00:23:18,232
Around the exam venue,

298
00:23:18,232 --> 00:23:21,068
there's a lot of beautiful
wisteria flowers.

299
00:23:21,235 --> 00:23:23,195
After you turn back into a human,
we can see the flowers together.

300
00:23:24,238 --> 00:23:27,074
Now, let me tell you
a Taisho secret!

301
00:23:27,449 --> 00:23:29,284
I heard that
the blond young man, Zenitsu...

302
00:23:29,284 --> 00:23:30,869
doesn't really want to join
the Final Selection.

303
00:23:30,869 --> 00:23:31,954
His master...

304
00:23:31,995 --> 00:23:33,956
slapped him multiple times
before he came.

305
00:23:34,081 --> 00:23:36,834
Next, Episode 5, "My Own Steel".

306
00:23:36,834 --> 00:23:39,837
(To be continued)
