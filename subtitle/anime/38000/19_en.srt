1
00:00:16,099 --> 00:00:17,184
How did that happen?

2
00:00:17,434 --> 00:00:18,435
I can't believe that my sword...

3
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:43,502
(Demon Slayer)

4
00:01:59,745 --> 00:02:03,040
(Episode 19: Hinokami)

5
00:02:14,885 --> 00:02:16,470
Incredible.

6
00:02:17,221 --> 00:02:18,555
He is on a completely
different level.

7
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:20,516
The power of his strike
is so different.

8
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:22,351
We're not in the same league at all.

9
00:02:22,935 --> 00:02:24,520
He sliced...

10
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,605
that hard demon like slicing tofu.

11
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:30,067
Incredible. He's utterly amazing!

12
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:33,028
Who's that guy?

13
00:02:33,362 --> 00:02:35,739
He's making me so excited.

14
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:46,416
Wait a moment!

15
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:49,002
Hey, have a duel with me!

16
00:02:49,336 --> 00:02:51,839
You won against
that Twelve Demon Moons.

17
00:02:51,964 --> 00:02:53,340
Then I'll win against you.

18
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:54,758
That's my plan.

19
00:02:54,758 --> 00:02:56,385
This way,

20
00:02:58,303 --> 00:03:00,931
I'll be the best.

21
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,933
Go back to training,

22
00:03:03,267 --> 00:03:04,268
you ridiculous guy.

23
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:08,480
What did you say?

24
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:11,483
That wasn't one of
the Twelve Demon Moons.

25
00:03:11,942 --> 00:03:13,402
Don't you even know that?

26
00:03:13,944 --> 00:03:15,237
I know!

27
00:03:15,487 --> 00:03:19,032
I didn't think that fiend would be
one of the Twelve Demon Moons.

28
00:03:19,408 --> 00:03:22,035
Tanjiro was the one who said he was
one of the Twelve Demon Moons.

29
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:25,289
I was just repeating what he said.

30
00:03:29,418 --> 00:03:30,502
What's going on?

31
00:03:30,502 --> 00:03:31,503
I got tied up.

32
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:32,921
He moves fast.

33
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:34,423
He's really fast.

34
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:36,675
Hey, stop!

35
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:39,887
Someone who doesn't even know
the condition of his wounds...

36
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:41,471
shouldn't be allowed to fight.

37
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:43,974
What did you say?
I didn't hear you clearly.

38
00:03:43,974 --> 00:03:46,185
You speak so softly
and you walk too fast.

39
00:03:46,435 --> 00:03:48,145
I told you to wait.

40
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:49,897
Untie me.

41
00:03:49,897 --> 00:03:55,110
Hey!

42
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:13,921
Can you hear me?

43
00:04:14,338 --> 00:04:15,714
Are you all right?

44
00:04:18,133 --> 00:04:19,426
Grandpa.

45
00:04:20,844 --> 00:04:22,763
Who's your grandpa?

46
00:04:23,555 --> 00:04:26,391
Grandpa came earlier.

47
00:04:27,309 --> 00:04:29,311
He told me not to give up.

48
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:32,397
You saw your life
flashing in front of you, right?

49
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:34,066
Some say that before someone dies,

50
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:37,236
they would see
flashbacks of their lives.

51
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:39,988
By searching through
past experiences and memories,

52
00:04:40,072 --> 00:04:43,742
one finds a way
to avoid impending death.

53
00:04:44,952 --> 00:04:45,953
Well...

54
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:47,704
But I've never had that experience,

55
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:49,289
so I don't know.

56
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:54,253
Because you're breathing properly,

57
00:04:54,253 --> 00:04:56,046
it slowed the spread of the poison.

58
00:04:56,505 --> 00:04:58,215
If you didn't do so,

59
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:00,551
you would have already become
a spider.

60
00:05:01,093 --> 00:05:02,845
I'll give you the antidote now.

61
00:05:06,181 --> 00:05:07,975
Hurry, over here.

62
00:05:10,102 --> 00:05:11,103
Can you bring them down?

63
00:05:11,687 --> 00:05:12,688
Be careful.

64
00:05:13,689 --> 00:05:15,440
It's fine. Everyone is alive.

65
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:33,792
The sword broke indeed.

66
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:35,794
Unbelievable.

67
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:37,796
Are the threads being controlled
by this child...

68
00:05:38,505 --> 00:05:40,549
tougher than the body...

69
00:05:40,799 --> 00:05:42,217
of the rock-hard demon
I couldn't kill just now?

70
00:05:43,886 --> 00:05:45,971
I'm sorry, Master Urokodaki,

71
00:05:46,555 --> 00:05:47,556
Mr. Haganezuka.

72
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:51,518
It's because I have poor skills.
That's why the sword broke.

73
00:05:54,563 --> 00:05:56,565
No, now isn't the time
to feel discouraged.

74
00:05:56,732 --> 00:05:58,442
I must think of something.

75
00:06:00,277 --> 00:06:01,737
Since I can't cut the thread,

76
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:03,864
if I can get into the inner area
of the thread...

77
00:06:09,912 --> 00:06:10,913
This won't work.

78
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:13,040
The threads seem to be alive.

79
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:14,208
I couldn't dodge them.

80
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:16,210
And in order not to kill me,

81
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:17,711
he is even intentionally
controlling the threads.

82
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:19,630
I can't do anything.

83
00:06:21,673 --> 00:06:22,674
So...

84
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:24,593
are you still not planning...

85
00:06:24,593 --> 00:06:26,178
to take back what you said?

86
00:06:29,223 --> 00:06:30,224
All right.

87
00:06:30,641 --> 00:06:32,976
I'll just slice you apart then.

88
00:06:34,937 --> 00:06:36,021
I can't dodge this!

89
00:06:47,241 --> 00:06:48,367
Nezuko!

90
00:06:52,663 --> 00:06:54,122
Nezuko.

91
00:06:54,706 --> 00:06:57,042
You protected me. I'm sorry.

92
00:06:58,001 --> 00:07:00,587
I can't believe
there's a girl in his box.

93
00:07:01,338 --> 00:07:03,507
But she's emitting a demonic vibe.

94
00:07:08,679 --> 00:07:09,763
You...

95
00:07:10,305 --> 00:07:11,390
and...

96
00:07:12,891 --> 00:07:13,976
that girl...

97
00:07:15,185 --> 00:07:16,270
Are you siblings?

98
00:07:16,895 --> 00:07:18,230
So what if we are?

99
00:07:19,314 --> 00:07:20,482
Her wounds are very deep.

100
00:07:21,358 --> 00:07:23,318
Her left arm is almost severed.

101
00:07:25,571 --> 00:07:28,574
Heal quickly.

102
00:07:29,908 --> 00:07:32,160
They are siblings.

103
00:07:32,911 --> 00:07:34,621
His younger sister
has already turned into a demon,

104
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:36,832
- but they are still together.
- Rui.

105
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:41,587
His younger sister came out
to protect her brother.

106
00:07:42,921 --> 00:07:44,381
It's a genuine bond.

107
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:45,883
I really want that.

108
00:07:46,216 --> 00:07:48,218
Wait a moment!

109
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:50,429
Please wait for a moment.

110
00:07:50,762 --> 00:07:52,222
I'm your elder sister.

111
00:07:52,306 --> 00:07:53,891
Don't abandon me!

112
00:07:53,891 --> 00:07:54,975
Shut up!

113
00:08:06,612 --> 00:08:10,449
You ended up
not completing your task.

114
00:08:11,283 --> 00:08:13,368
It has always been the same
every time.

115
00:08:14,328 --> 00:08:16,288
Wait a moment.

116
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:19,082
I'm your elder sister.

117
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:20,918
Let me make it up to you.

118
00:08:21,502 --> 00:08:22,753
In that case,

119
00:08:22,878 --> 00:08:26,048
go and kill all the people
wandering around the mountain.

120
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:28,008
If you can do that,

121
00:08:28,425 --> 00:08:30,135
I'll forgive you
for what happened just now.

122
00:08:32,054 --> 00:08:33,055
All right.

123
00:08:33,555 --> 00:08:34,765
I'll go and kill them.

124
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:42,231
Hey, kid.

125
00:08:43,482 --> 00:08:45,859
Kid, let's talk.

126
00:08:46,068 --> 00:08:47,110
Come out first.

127
00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:49,696
"Kid"?

128
00:08:50,697 --> 00:08:51,698
"Talk"?

129
00:08:53,075 --> 00:08:55,827
I was really moved
when I saw you two.

130
00:08:56,662 --> 00:08:59,498
My body can't help but shake.

131
00:09:00,374 --> 00:09:03,919
I think no words in this world
can describe how moved I am.

132
00:09:04,962 --> 00:09:07,548
But I still have to kill you both.

133
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:09,800
You'll feel sad...

134
00:09:10,092 --> 00:09:11,510
if that happens, right?

135
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:16,181
There's only one way...

136
00:09:17,391 --> 00:09:20,018
to avoid that from happening.

137
00:09:21,186 --> 00:09:22,980
Your younger sister...

138
00:09:24,273 --> 00:09:26,233
Give me your younger sister.

139
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:28,527
If you give her to me,

140
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:30,988
I'll spare you.

141
00:09:33,657 --> 00:09:35,826
I don't understand
what you're talking about.

142
00:09:37,286 --> 00:09:40,205
I want your younger sister
to become my younger sister...

143
00:09:40,706 --> 00:09:41,707
starting today.

144
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:45,836
How can I agree to such a thing?

145
00:09:46,587 --> 00:09:48,505
Nezuko is not an object.

146
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:51,133
She has her own views and thoughts.

147
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:54,219
She won't become
your younger sister.

148
00:09:55,512 --> 00:09:58,265
Don't worry about that.

149
00:09:58,891 --> 00:10:02,769
I'm more powerful than you
in terms of bonds.

150
00:10:03,562 --> 00:10:04,980
It's a bond of fear.

151
00:10:05,647 --> 00:10:08,025
I'll show her what will happen
if she defies me.

152
00:10:08,275 --> 00:10:10,444
There must be a limit to jokes!

153
00:10:10,861 --> 00:10:13,197
Using fear to restrict someone...

154
00:10:13,238 --> 00:10:15,032
is not a family bond at all!

155
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:18,243
If you can't fix
your misunderstanding of bonds,

156
00:10:18,493 --> 00:10:20,787
you will never get what you want.

157
00:10:21,997 --> 00:10:23,373
You're so noisy.

158
00:10:23,707 --> 00:10:25,584
Can you not speak so loudly?

159
00:10:26,043 --> 00:10:27,586
We really don't get along.

160
00:10:33,091 --> 00:10:35,552
I'll never give Nezuko to you.

161
00:10:36,929 --> 00:10:38,180
Fine. It doesn't matter to me.

162
00:10:38,555 --> 00:10:39,806
I'll kill you, then I'll take her.

163
00:10:40,474 --> 00:10:42,601
I'll cut off your head first.

164
00:10:43,602 --> 00:10:45,354
Such strong words.

165
00:10:46,355 --> 00:10:48,273
Try it if you can.

166
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,985
Let's see if you can win...

167
00:10:52,611 --> 00:10:54,029
against one of
the Twelve Demon Moons like me.

168
00:11:04,206 --> 00:11:05,207
Family.

169
00:11:07,292 --> 00:11:09,670
A dad has responsibilities as a dad.

170
00:11:10,712 --> 00:11:13,090
A mom has responsibilities as a mom.

171
00:11:14,716 --> 00:11:16,134
Parents protect their children.

172
00:11:17,511 --> 00:11:20,889
Elder siblings protect
their younger siblings.

173
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:23,267
No matter what happens,

174
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:26,228
they'll risk their lives
to protect them.

175
00:11:27,771 --> 00:11:28,856
I think...

176
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:32,401
one who doesn't understand
his responsibility...

177
00:11:32,651 --> 00:11:35,279
doesn't need to stay alive.

178
00:11:36,697 --> 00:11:37,698
What about you?

179
00:11:38,699 --> 00:11:40,492
What's your responsibility?

180
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:43,161
Your responsibility...

181
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:45,289
is to disappear after giving me
your younger sister.

182
00:11:45,914 --> 00:11:48,041
If you can't even do that,
then you can only die.

183
00:11:49,334 --> 00:11:50,669
It's because
you can't win against me.

184
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:54,882
Lower Moon Five.

185
00:11:55,966 --> 00:11:57,968
No wonder he's so strong.

186
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:00,679
He's one of
the Twelve Demon Moons indeed.

187
00:12:02,014 --> 00:12:03,682
I can't easily cut off his thread.

188
00:12:04,183 --> 00:12:05,184
What should I do?

189
00:12:05,684 --> 00:12:07,060
Use the part of the sword
that broke off?

190
00:12:07,811 --> 00:12:09,938
If his neck is tougher
than the threads...

191
00:12:11,148 --> 00:12:12,858
What an annoying pair of eyes.

192
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:14,151
I see a fire in them.

193
00:12:14,943 --> 00:12:16,195
What a fool.

194
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:17,821
Could it be...

195
00:12:18,488 --> 00:12:20,866
that you want to win against me?

196
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:26,371
Nezuko!

197
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:30,584
I have your younger sister now.

198
00:12:31,001 --> 00:12:33,253
Do you have any realizations
about your responsibility now?

199
00:12:33,462 --> 00:12:34,671
Let her go!

200
00:12:35,547 --> 00:12:37,216
I told you if you don't fight back,

201
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:39,051
I can spare you.

202
00:12:50,812 --> 00:12:51,939
Nezuko is gone.

203
00:12:59,988 --> 00:13:01,198
Nezuko!

204
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:09,873
You're so noisy.

205
00:13:10,415 --> 00:13:12,668
That won't kill her...

206
00:13:12,876 --> 00:13:13,919
because she's a demon.

207
00:13:15,045 --> 00:13:17,756
But I must teach her well.

208
00:13:18,382 --> 00:13:20,384
Let her continue bleeding for now.

209
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:23,595
If she still won't be good,

210
00:13:24,054 --> 00:13:25,931
I'll leave her like that
until sunrise.

211
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:28,642
Let her get roasted a little.

212
00:13:28,976 --> 00:13:32,646
Let Nezuko go!

213
00:13:55,377 --> 00:13:58,255
I don't think you can do it.

214
00:13:59,506 --> 00:14:01,550
Do you think
you can cut off my head...

215
00:14:01,675 --> 00:14:04,011
if you come near me?

216
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:11,310
Sure. Try it.

217
00:14:19,276 --> 00:14:20,319
The sword...

218
00:14:21,069 --> 00:14:22,070
can't cut him.

219
00:14:25,032 --> 00:14:26,658
Haven't I already told you?

220
00:14:27,618 --> 00:14:29,995
You can't win against me.

221
00:14:37,211 --> 00:14:39,213
My body is tougher...

222
00:14:39,254 --> 00:14:41,256
than any thread I'm controlling.

223
00:14:42,174 --> 00:14:44,176
You can't even cut the thread.

224
00:14:44,301 --> 00:14:46,637
Of course you can't cut my head.

225
00:14:58,148 --> 00:14:59,149
He's so strong.

226
00:14:59,566 --> 00:15:03,153
He's stronger than any demon
I've encountered so far.

227
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:06,532
He's one of the Twelve Demon Moons.

228
00:15:07,699 --> 00:15:09,701
Are they strong because
they have Kibutsuji's power...

229
00:15:09,826 --> 00:15:10,869
from his blood?

230
00:15:17,042 --> 00:15:18,043
You're so noisy.

231
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:20,087
Keep quiet.

232
00:15:23,382 --> 00:15:24,716
Stop!

233
00:15:25,467 --> 00:15:27,803
I'm your brother now.

234
00:15:28,262 --> 00:15:30,138
Stop screaming.

235
00:15:33,058 --> 00:15:34,059
I must calm down.

236
00:15:34,351 --> 00:15:35,811
I can't be affected by my emotions.

237
00:15:36,395 --> 00:15:37,437
If I go on this way,

238
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:38,480
I'll let my opponent
get what he wants.

239
00:15:43,318 --> 00:15:44,695
She lost consciousness.

240
00:15:45,863 --> 00:15:47,197
Has she fallen asleep?

241
00:15:48,407 --> 00:15:50,534
What a unique demon.

242
00:15:50,909 --> 00:15:53,453
It seems like
she's a bit different from us.

243
00:15:54,371 --> 00:15:55,497
How interesting.

244
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,250
I must be focused.

245
00:15:58,834 --> 00:16:00,210
I have to adjust my breathing.

246
00:16:00,502 --> 00:16:03,380
I must use the
most outstanding final form.

247
00:16:04,214 --> 00:16:06,008
Total Concentration Breathing.

248
00:16:08,594 --> 00:16:11,346
Don't you get it?
You're just wasting your efforts.

249
00:16:15,851 --> 00:16:17,352
Water Breathing.

250
00:16:17,644 --> 00:16:18,896
Tenth Form.

251
00:16:19,563 --> 00:16:21,607
Constant Flux!

252
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:27,821
It broke.

253
00:16:27,905 --> 00:16:28,947
I broke the thread.

254
00:16:29,907 --> 00:16:32,451
He increased his power
through constant turning.

255
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:35,078
This technique is a bit troublesome.

256
00:16:35,704 --> 00:16:36,914
It worked.

257
00:16:37,164 --> 00:16:38,707
As long as I can shorten
our distance,

258
00:16:38,707 --> 00:16:39,791
I can win.

259
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:44,421
Hey.

260
00:16:44,588 --> 00:16:47,966
Do you think this is the hardest
the thread can be?

261
00:16:48,967 --> 00:16:51,470
Blood Demon Art,
Cutting Thread Cage.

262
00:16:53,138 --> 00:16:54,640
That's enough.

263
00:16:55,182 --> 00:16:56,350
You should disappear now.

264
00:16:58,602 --> 00:16:59,686
No.

265
00:16:59,853 --> 00:17:01,063
I can't cut through these threads.

266
00:17:01,396 --> 00:17:02,814
The turning speed isn't enough.

267
00:17:03,607 --> 00:17:06,068
The smell is also different
from the thread earlier.

268
00:17:06,944 --> 00:17:09,279
I definitely can't lose.

269
00:17:10,155 --> 00:17:11,198
I'll die.

270
00:17:11,573 --> 00:17:12,699
I'm going to lose.

271
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,201
Die...

272
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,561
Dad.

273
00:17:43,272 --> 00:17:44,273
Tanjiro.

274
00:17:45,691 --> 00:17:46,692
Breathe.

275
00:17:47,568 --> 00:17:49,027
Adjust your breathing.

276
00:17:49,486 --> 00:17:51,530
You must become the God of Fire.

277
00:18:01,874 --> 00:18:02,875
Tanjiro.

278
00:18:03,542 --> 00:18:04,543
Look.

279
00:18:04,835 --> 00:18:06,545
Your dad is doing the kagura dance.

280
00:18:07,754 --> 00:18:09,965
Our family works with fire.

281
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:12,384
In order to avoid getting hurt
and prevent disasters,

282
00:18:12,801 --> 00:18:14,011
when a new year starts,

283
00:18:14,094 --> 00:18:17,556
we must dance to the God of Fire
to pray for safety.

284
00:18:23,812 --> 00:18:25,314
Mom.

285
00:18:26,815 --> 00:18:28,901
Dad's body is so frail.

286
00:18:28,942 --> 00:18:30,861
How can he dance for so long...

287
00:18:30,861 --> 00:18:32,863
in the snow?

288
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:38,076
His lungs would freeze this way.

289
00:18:41,205 --> 00:18:43,290
It's because there's a technique
in breathing.

290
00:18:43,874 --> 00:18:45,209
It's a kind of breathing
that won't make you tired...

291
00:18:45,209 --> 00:18:47,127
no matter how intense
your movements are.

292
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:48,921
Breathing?

293
00:18:49,796 --> 00:18:50,797
That's right.

294
00:18:51,006 --> 00:18:53,425
As long as you breathe properly,

295
00:18:53,884 --> 00:18:56,094
you can also keep dancing, Tanjiro.

296
00:18:57,012 --> 00:18:59,056
You won't mind the cold at all.

297
00:19:00,599 --> 00:19:01,600
Tanjiro.

298
00:19:02,434 --> 00:19:05,395
Don't let the Kagura and earrings
become a lost art.

299
00:19:06,438 --> 00:19:08,815
We must pass it on
from one generation to the next.

300
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:11,527
This is our promise.

301
00:19:17,658 --> 00:19:19,535
Dance of the Fire God.

302
00:19:22,246 --> 00:19:23,830
The dance.

303
00:19:24,414 --> 00:19:25,415
The thread...

304
00:19:30,587 --> 00:19:31,588
I can't stop.

305
00:19:31,839 --> 00:19:32,923
Continue running.

306
00:19:33,674 --> 00:19:34,800
If I stop now,

307
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:36,760
I'll get the backlash for changing
from Water Breathing...

308
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:39,388
to the Dance of the Fire God.

309
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:43,976
Then I would be
temporarily paralyzed.

310
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:47,980
That's why I must continue now.

311
00:19:48,856 --> 00:19:52,067
Run! I must protect Nezuko!

312
00:20:00,492 --> 00:20:01,493
This guy.

313
00:20:12,129 --> 00:20:14,256
I see the opening thread.

314
00:20:15,048 --> 00:20:16,884
I'm going to defeat him here.

315
00:20:17,259 --> 00:20:18,260
Even if...

316
00:20:19,052 --> 00:20:21,388
both of us will die.

317
00:20:23,807 --> 00:20:26,310
Nezuko.

318
00:20:28,103 --> 00:20:30,022
Wake up, Nezuko.

319
00:20:31,481 --> 00:20:33,108
You must save your brother.

320
00:20:34,067 --> 00:20:35,861
You can surely save him.

321
00:20:37,613 --> 00:20:38,614
All the best.

322
00:20:45,913 --> 00:20:47,956
Please, Nezuko.

323
00:20:48,749 --> 00:20:51,126
Otherwise, your brother will die.

324
00:20:55,047 --> 00:20:56,673
Blood Demon Art.

325
00:20:58,509 --> 00:20:59,843
Exploding Blood.

326
00:21:09,478 --> 00:21:10,479
How is that possible?

327
00:21:10,729 --> 00:21:12,397
It burned through the thread.

328
00:21:13,148 --> 00:21:15,526
My bond with Nezuko...

329
00:21:16,151 --> 00:21:17,694
cannot be broken...

330
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,571
by anyone!

331
00:23:00,005 --> 00:23:01,006
(Demon Slayer)

332
00:23:03,133 --> 00:23:04,718
Why did I think
of the Dance of the Fire God...

333
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:06,178
at that moment?

334
00:23:06,595 --> 00:23:07,721
Thank you, Dad.

335
00:23:09,014 --> 00:23:11,892
Thanks to Dad, my sword was able
to cut off the demon's neck.

336
00:23:12,059 --> 00:23:13,310
Nezuko, I must thank you too.

337
00:23:14,102 --> 00:23:17,856
Now, let me tell you
a Taisho secret!

338
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:19,191
After the worship ceremony,

00:23:19,191 --> 00:23:22,027
Dad and Mom would surely
grill some scallops for us.

340
00:23:23,362 --> 00:23:25,948
While we're eating,
we could hear grilling sounds.

341
00:23:25,989 --> 00:23:27,032
It was so nice.

342
00:23:27,616 --> 00:23:28,742
Thank you, Nezuko.

343
00:23:28,867 --> 00:23:30,452
Now isn't the time
to be in a calm mood, right?

344
00:23:31,828 --> 00:23:34,706
Next, Episode 20, "Pretend Family".

345
00:23:34,873 --> 00:23:37,334
Did I defeat the Twelve Demon Moons?

00:23:37,793 --> 00:23:39,878
