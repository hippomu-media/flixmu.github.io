1
00:00:02,961 --> 00:00:05,214
How should we kill him?

2
00:00:07,299 --> 00:00:09,259
I feel a rush of power in me.

3
00:00:09,843 --> 00:00:13,222
It's all thanks to the blood
Lord Kibutsuji shared with me.

4
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:17,976
Of course we must kill him brutally.

5
00:00:20,437 --> 00:00:21,438
Get down!

6
00:00:34,201 --> 00:00:36,245
Have you decided how we'll kill him?

7
00:00:36,286 --> 00:00:38,705
Of course we'll kill him brutally!

8
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:10,571
(Demon Slayer)

9
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:29,525
(Episode 9: Temari Demon
and Arrow Demon)

10
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:46,250
It's just as you said, Yahaba.

11
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:49,795
There's a house
in such a deserted place like this.

12
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:53,006
It seems like it's the use of...

13
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:55,801
a Blood Demon Art
that cleverly hides objects.

14
00:02:57,636 --> 00:03:01,598
And a demon slayer
is hanging around a demon.

15
00:03:01,932 --> 00:03:03,392
Why is this?

16
00:03:05,394 --> 00:03:07,104
Things are getting interesting now.

17
00:03:08,522 --> 00:03:10,274
By the way, Susamaru,

18
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:13,694
should I say you're immature...

19
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:15,863
or just stupid?

20
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,531
So filthy.

21
00:03:17,781 --> 00:03:20,200
The dust has gotten
my clothes all dirty.

22
00:03:21,368 --> 00:03:23,120
Stop nagging.

23
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:25,914
We were able to find him so quickly
because of my ball,

24
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:27,249
so don't complain.

25
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:29,918
I can have some fun now!

26
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:37,885
You're getting me dirty again!

27
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:39,845
You're so fussy!

28
00:03:40,137 --> 00:03:42,556
Your clothes aren't dirty at all!

29
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:44,474
Plus...

30
00:03:51,273 --> 00:03:53,650
We found them!

31
00:03:55,152 --> 00:03:56,153
A ball?

32
00:03:56,945 --> 00:03:58,197
All she did was throw a ball...

33
00:03:58,197 --> 00:04:00,240
and it destroyed the house
to this extent.

34
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:03,994
Is this woman...

35
00:04:04,203 --> 00:04:06,038
one of Kibutsuji's people?

36
00:04:19,927 --> 00:04:21,178
Lady Tamayo!

37
00:04:26,725 --> 00:04:27,809
Yushiro!

38
00:04:29,937 --> 00:04:30,938
Darn it!

39
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:32,105
Nezuko!

40
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:33,815
Take the woman sleeping inside...

41
00:04:33,941 --> 00:04:35,943
to a safe place outside.

42
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:39,112
It's too dangerous outside!

43
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:40,405
There's a basement in this house!

44
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:41,490
Go there!

45
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:42,533
I got it!

46
00:04:42,866 --> 00:04:43,867
Nezuko!

47
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:50,332
I killed one!

48
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:54,837
Their scent is completely different
than all the other demons I've seen.

49
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:56,755
Are they really powerful?

50
00:04:56,797 --> 00:04:58,090
It's a rich scent!

51
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:00,425
It already feels so heavy
the moment it reaches my lungs.

52
00:05:09,977 --> 00:05:13,397
The demon slayer
that wears hanafuda earrings...

53
00:05:13,856 --> 00:05:15,357
must be you, right?

54
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:18,068
Are they here for me?

55
00:05:19,111 --> 00:05:20,112
Lady Tamayo!

56
00:05:20,237 --> 00:05:22,447
Please find somewhere you can hide!

57
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:24,283
I'm their target!

58
00:05:25,117 --> 00:05:26,410
Tanjiro.

59
00:05:26,535 --> 00:05:29,371
Please concentrate on fighting.
Don't worry about us.

60
00:05:30,122 --> 00:05:32,291
You don't need to protect us.
We'll be fine.

61
00:05:34,793 --> 00:05:36,086
Because we're demons.

62
00:05:37,421 --> 00:05:38,964
Now,

63
00:05:39,798 --> 00:05:42,134
I'll send you to your death
with this ball!

64
00:05:45,929 --> 00:05:47,973
Even if I dodge it,
the ball will change directions.

65
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:58,609
Among the 10 forms,

66
00:05:59,318 --> 00:06:01,195
the fastest striking technique is...

67
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,155
Total Concentration Breathing.

68
00:06:03,155 --> 00:06:04,573
Water Breathing!

69
00:06:04,907 --> 00:06:06,033
Seventh Form!

70
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:09,286
Drop Ripple Thrust Curve!

71
00:06:13,332 --> 00:06:15,209
You struck the sword
in an arc from the side...

72
00:06:15,209 --> 00:06:17,252
to minimize the impact of the ball.

73
00:06:18,837 --> 00:06:19,880
But...

74
00:06:24,927 --> 00:06:26,803
How can this ball move by itself?

75
00:06:27,763 --> 00:06:29,515
When it hit Yushiro,

76
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:31,600
it also switched directions
unnaturally.

77
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:35,687
But there isn't anything special
about the spin of the ball...

78
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:37,231
What in the world is this...

79
00:06:41,652 --> 00:06:42,736
Yushiro!

80
00:06:43,654 --> 00:06:44,738
Yushiro!

81
00:06:59,253 --> 00:07:00,671
Lady Tamayo!

82
00:07:01,046 --> 00:07:03,006
I told you!

83
00:07:03,382 --> 00:07:06,051
From the start, I told you...

84
00:07:06,218 --> 00:07:07,636
we cannot get involved with
a demon slayer!

85
00:07:08,178 --> 00:07:11,390
My Blindfold Spell
is not impeccable!

86
00:07:11,807 --> 00:07:14,393
You should know that very well!

87
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:16,645
I can conceal traces
of the house and humans,

88
00:07:16,687 --> 00:07:18,105
along with their scent,

89
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:20,858
but their existence
won't disappear just like that.

90
00:07:22,943 --> 00:07:25,654
The more people there are,
the more hints we leave behind.

91
00:07:25,821 --> 00:07:28,657
The chances of being found
by Kibutsuji will also increase.

92
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:32,077
The demons were able
to get so close to us...

93
00:07:32,286 --> 00:07:34,621
and their scent was undetectable
before they came to attack.

94
00:07:35,831 --> 00:07:38,166
Was it because of Yushiro's
Blood Demon Arts?

95
00:07:39,501 --> 00:07:43,088
I hate anyone who disrupts...

96
00:07:43,297 --> 00:07:44,840
our time with each other!

97
00:07:45,883 --> 00:07:47,676
I despise them so much!

98
00:07:48,886 --> 00:07:50,512
It's unforgivable!

99
00:07:54,099 --> 00:07:55,893
What are you saying?

100
00:07:57,561 --> 00:07:59,188
This is fun.

101
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:01,190
This is really fun!

102
00:08:01,773 --> 00:08:04,985
You should feel honored...

103
00:08:05,235 --> 00:08:07,321
that you get to be killed by someone
from the Twelve Demon Moons!

104
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:09,406
The Twelve Demon Moons?

105
00:08:10,449 --> 00:08:12,451
They're demons
who work directly under Kibutsuji.

106
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:22,461
She grew more arms!

107
00:08:27,257 --> 00:08:28,258
All right.

108
00:08:28,509 --> 00:08:30,010
Let's continue playing.

109
00:08:30,344 --> 00:08:32,221
Let's play until morning!

110
00:08:32,221 --> 00:08:34,765
We'll have fun until you die!

111
00:08:44,358 --> 00:08:46,568
If I activate my spell now,

112
00:08:46,568 --> 00:08:48,487
it will affect Tanjiro too.

113
00:08:49,571 --> 00:08:52,950
Plus, Yushiro also needs time
to prepare his attack.

114
00:08:54,117 --> 00:08:55,285
If this continues...

115
00:08:58,956 --> 00:09:00,082
Here they come again.

116
00:09:00,082 --> 00:09:01,583
The balls change
their course of direction...

117
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:03,043
without even hitting anything.

118
00:09:07,756 --> 00:09:10,008
Though slashing them
weakens their power,

119
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:12,469
they still end up hitting me.

120
00:09:16,974 --> 00:09:18,642
I smell two scents of blood...

121
00:09:19,101 --> 00:09:20,561
and there are two demons.

122
00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:22,771
I can differentiate their positions
with their scents,

123
00:09:23,647 --> 00:09:24,815
but...

124
00:09:29,444 --> 00:09:30,487
Lady Tamayo!

125
00:09:30,487 --> 00:09:31,613
Yushiro!

126
00:09:33,156 --> 00:09:34,241
This won't do.

127
00:09:34,241 --> 00:09:35,951
I can't take care of them
at the same time.

128
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:39,079
Our wounds will heal,

129
00:09:39,329 --> 00:09:40,539
so don't worry about us!

130
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:42,708
You useless demon slayer!

131
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:45,544
If you look at the arrows, you'll
know which direction they're going!

132
00:09:45,961 --> 00:09:47,629
You have to avoid the arrows!

133
00:09:48,213 --> 00:09:49,339
The arrows?

134
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:51,425
Darn it.

135
00:09:51,675 --> 00:09:53,468
You couldn't even see that?

136
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:56,096
I'll lend you my vision!

137
00:09:56,555 --> 00:09:59,391
With it, you should be able
to decapitate that Temari woman!

138
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:13,405
I see them!

139
00:10:13,655 --> 00:10:16,158
So, it's the arrows that are...

140
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:19,536
driving the trajectory of the balls.

141
00:10:22,915 --> 00:10:24,374
Yushiro, thank you!

142
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:26,752
I also see the arrows now!

143
00:10:27,294 --> 00:10:29,087
Then, hurry up and get rid of them!

144
00:10:30,214 --> 00:10:31,215
Nezuko!

145
00:10:31,465 --> 00:10:32,925
Nezuko, go outside!

146
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:34,885
Please take care
of the demon in the tree.

147
00:10:44,061 --> 00:10:46,146
I'm the one you're after.

148
00:10:47,231 --> 00:10:51,318
A slayer who
wears hanafuda earrings...

149
00:10:51,652 --> 00:10:53,028
There's no doubt it's you.

150
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:56,823
I'm going to bring that head
back to Lord Kibutsuji.

151
00:11:00,619 --> 00:11:02,287
This is so fun!

152
00:11:09,253 --> 00:11:11,588
Nezuko, have you not found him yet?

153
00:11:24,393 --> 00:11:25,435
The arrows disappeared!

154
00:11:27,938 --> 00:11:29,523
Water Breathing!

155
00:11:36,738 --> 00:11:38,282
Third Form!

156
00:11:38,282 --> 00:11:39,741
Flowing Dance!

157
00:11:43,871 --> 00:11:45,038
Lady Tamayo!

158
00:11:45,455 --> 00:11:48,709
Are those two demons
similar to Kibutsuji?

159
00:11:49,251 --> 00:11:50,335
I'm afraid so.

160
00:11:50,794 --> 00:11:55,007
Then, I'll be sure to bring a sample
of their blood to you!

161
00:12:09,021 --> 00:12:11,315
I have two things
to trouble you with.

162
00:12:12,274 --> 00:12:13,358
First.

163
00:12:13,525 --> 00:12:16,361
I need your sister's blood
for my research.

164
00:12:16,737 --> 00:12:17,905
Second.

165
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:19,406
I hope you can collect...

166
00:12:19,406 --> 00:12:21,700
blood from the demons...

167
00:12:21,742 --> 00:12:24,077
who have a large amount
of Kibutsuji's blood.

168
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:28,749
Those demons
that have thick Kibutsuji's blood...

169
00:12:28,999 --> 00:12:33,670
are demons who are
as powerful as Kibutsuji.

170
00:12:34,171 --> 00:12:37,508
It won't be easy to extract blood
from those demons.

171
00:12:40,177 --> 00:12:41,553
Third Form!

172
00:12:41,845 --> 00:12:43,263
Flowing Dance!

173
00:12:47,309 --> 00:12:48,477
Lady Tamayo!

174
00:12:48,769 --> 00:12:52,105
Are those two demons
similar to Kibutsuji?

175
00:12:52,689 --> 00:12:54,024
I'm afraid so.

176
00:13:05,702 --> 00:13:08,247
Did you say you're going
to collect a sample of our blood?

177
00:13:08,747 --> 00:13:11,500
I don't know what you're planning,

178
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:13,502
but I won't let you do anything...

179
00:13:13,502 --> 00:13:16,547
that will upset Lord Kibutsuji!

180
00:13:19,591 --> 00:13:22,177
If you think you can
take the blood of someone...

181
00:13:22,219 --> 00:13:24,137
from the Twelve Demon Moons,

182
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:25,973
go ahead and try.

183
00:13:26,598 --> 00:13:27,724
Be careful!

184
00:13:27,933 --> 00:13:29,810
You can't let
your guard down at all!

185
00:13:30,227 --> 00:13:32,980
If they're really part of
the Twelve Demon Moons,

186
00:13:33,063 --> 00:13:35,899
they'll undoubtedly
be harder to deal with...

187
00:13:35,899 --> 00:13:37,943
than any of the other demons
you've defeated!

188
00:13:37,985 --> 00:13:39,820
Okay, I got it!

189
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,572
I will be on alert!

190
00:13:41,572 --> 00:13:43,031
I won't be careless.

191
00:13:43,073 --> 00:13:44,324
I'll take them down first...

192
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:45,492
Up until now...

193
00:13:45,868 --> 00:13:47,703
Okay! I'll do my best!

194
00:13:48,453 --> 00:13:49,496
Lady Tamayo.

195
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:52,541
Let's use them as bait
and we can quickly escape!

196
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:55,460
I was joking!

197
00:14:03,135 --> 00:14:05,179
Stop kicking up the dust!

198
00:14:06,054 --> 00:14:07,264
It's filthy!

199
00:14:20,569 --> 00:14:24,281
She grows new arms
in the split of a moment!

200
00:14:25,532 --> 00:14:28,911
She regenerates way faster than
the demons in the Final Selection.

201
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:34,625
I'm going to offer your head to him.

202
00:14:42,216 --> 00:14:43,342
Nezuko!

203
00:14:47,513 --> 00:14:50,265
Both of you, die!

204
00:14:54,645 --> 00:14:56,230
Are you okay, Nezuko?

205
00:14:56,605 --> 00:14:58,273
Hey, demon slayer!

206
00:14:59,066 --> 00:15:01,568
Get rid of that Arrow guy first!

207
00:15:01,818 --> 00:15:04,279
We'll fight that Temari woman
with your sister!

208
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:05,906
All right!

209
00:15:06,448 --> 00:15:07,616
Nezuko.

210
00:15:07,616 --> 00:15:09,368
Don't push yourself too hard!

211
00:15:24,341 --> 00:15:25,551
I'm counting on you.

212
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:28,136
I'm going to get their blood.

213
00:15:28,303 --> 00:15:30,097
I have to successfully extract
a sample of their blood!

214
00:15:30,138 --> 00:15:33,183
In order to develop a cure
as soon as possible,

215
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,352
I'm willing to take on
any kind of demons!

216
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:37,062
I'll do everything I can
to battle and win!

217
00:15:40,107 --> 00:15:41,233
I see it.

218
00:15:41,859 --> 00:15:43,110
An opening thread!

219
00:15:44,736 --> 00:15:47,197
What a disgusting little brat.

220
00:15:47,489 --> 00:15:49,241
Don't come near me!

221
00:15:52,369 --> 00:15:53,453
I can't believe it.

222
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:54,580
The thread broke...

223
00:16:10,971 --> 00:16:12,097
It kind of hurts.

224
00:16:12,097 --> 00:16:14,558
No, it's really painful!

225
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:26,570
It's time to make my move.

226
00:16:28,363 --> 00:16:30,490
I need to use a technique that
reduces the strength of the impact.

227
00:16:31,116 --> 00:16:32,534
Eighth Form!

228
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:34,119
Waterfall Basin!

229
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:54,306
She disappeared!

230
00:17:04,858 --> 00:17:07,236
You hurt Lady Tamayo!

231
00:17:07,653 --> 00:17:09,530
I won't let you off!

232
00:17:10,656 --> 00:17:11,907
Tamayo?

233
00:17:12,282 --> 00:17:13,492
Susamaru!

234
00:17:13,784 --> 00:17:17,371
Is the girl beside you,
Tamayo, the traitor?

235
00:17:17,955 --> 00:17:20,165
This is the perfect souvenir
to bring back.

236
00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:22,376
Is that so?

237
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:29,216
- You idiot!
- Don't kick the ball!

238
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,311
How interesting.

239
00:17:41,478 --> 00:17:43,230
This is so entertaining.

240
00:17:44,022 --> 00:17:45,774
Kicking ball is great too.

241
00:17:46,733 --> 00:17:48,068
Yahaba.

242
00:17:48,527 --> 00:17:51,572
Why don't we just bring
four heads back?

243
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:54,324
No, two heads.

244
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:56,827
Just the heads of the slayer
and the traitor.

245
00:17:57,536 --> 00:17:59,496
We don't need the other two.

246
00:18:02,124 --> 00:18:03,375
Nezuko!

247
00:18:04,459 --> 00:18:06,378
I can't stop the bleeding
right away.

248
00:18:07,045 --> 00:18:08,630
She's recovering very slowly.

249
00:18:10,299 --> 00:18:13,385
This medicine will help you
heal your foot immediately.

250
00:18:25,022 --> 00:18:26,273
What should I do?

251
00:18:27,399 --> 00:18:28,984
I can't lose.

252
00:18:30,277 --> 00:18:31,403
But...

253
00:18:31,445 --> 00:18:33,989
It's difficult to slash him
even though I see an opening thread.

254
00:18:35,282 --> 00:18:36,533
My moves...

255
00:18:36,533 --> 00:18:38,327
They're meaningless...

256
00:18:38,368 --> 00:18:40,996
if I cannot strike precisely
at his weakness.

257
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:43,165
If I miss even by just a little bit,

258
00:18:43,165 --> 00:18:45,626
the impact of the move
won't be as effective.

259
00:18:46,376 --> 00:18:48,128
The direction of my sword...

260
00:18:48,128 --> 00:18:50,464
will change depending
on the arrow's ability.

261
00:18:52,049 --> 00:18:54,760
Also, I feel sorry to say this,

262
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,678
but the eyeballs on his hands
really gross me out.

263
00:18:57,262 --> 00:18:58,680
Sorry for being rude!

264
00:19:06,396 --> 00:19:08,106
These arrows are moving
at such a fast speed!

265
00:19:08,982 --> 00:19:11,693
They won't disappear
until they hit me.

266
00:19:12,569 --> 00:19:14,655
And my sword can't slice them!

267
00:19:15,155 --> 00:19:16,907
The moment my blade touches one,

268
00:19:16,907 --> 00:19:19,284
I get flung
in the direction of the arrow.

269
00:19:25,374 --> 00:19:27,459
What exactly should I do?

270
00:19:35,509 --> 00:19:38,011
Everything is
within my expectations.

271
00:19:38,262 --> 00:19:39,847
I'm going to twist your arm
until it breaks.

272
00:19:51,525 --> 00:19:54,152
You did a flip in the same direction
of the Koketsu Arrow...

273
00:19:54,152 --> 00:19:55,487
and freed yourself from the attack.

274
00:19:56,196 --> 00:19:57,489
You stupid monkey.

275
00:19:58,490 --> 00:20:01,034
It's over if I keep getting
attacked like this.

276
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:02,703
I have to retaliate!

277
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,746
I must change the direction
of those arrows...

278
00:20:04,746 --> 00:20:07,040
without having to touch them!

279
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,294
It's about time you die now!

280
00:20:12,629 --> 00:20:14,089
I have to be versatile
with my techniques!

281
00:20:15,465 --> 00:20:18,886
First, I'll use the Sixth Form
to enfold the arrows,

282
00:20:21,513 --> 00:20:23,891
then I'll use the Third Form
to move toward him rapidly.

283
00:20:25,184 --> 00:20:26,768
That will close
the distance between us!

284
00:20:31,773 --> 00:20:32,816
Twist!

285
00:20:32,941 --> 00:20:34,193
Enfold!

286
00:20:36,737 --> 00:20:38,238
Whirlpool!

287
00:20:38,238 --> 00:20:39,615
Flow!

288
00:20:45,746 --> 00:20:47,497
My sword is so heavy!

289
00:20:48,957 --> 00:20:50,125
But...

290
00:20:50,667 --> 00:20:52,961
Second Form Improved!

291
00:20:53,921 --> 00:20:56,298
Lateral Water Wheel!

292
00:22:39,985 --> 00:22:40,986
(Demon Slayer)

293
00:22:44,907 --> 00:22:46,742
Those two demons are really strong!

294
00:22:46,742 --> 00:22:50,037
The combo of the balls
and arrows is so hard to defeat!

295
00:22:50,245 --> 00:22:52,206
Nezuko, are you okay?

296
00:22:53,999 --> 00:22:55,792
Now, let me tell you
a Taisho secret!

297
00:22:55,834 --> 00:22:57,753
It's about those two demons.

298
00:22:57,794 --> 00:22:59,880
Apparently, today
was the first time...

299
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:00,964
that Yahaba and Susamaru met.

300
00:23:00,964 --> 00:23:02,591
They got to know
one another while chatting...

301
00:23:02,591 --> 00:23:05,010
just before they found us.

302
00:23:05,594 --> 00:23:08,055
It was their first time meeting,
yet they had such great teamwork.

303
00:23:08,055 --> 00:23:09,264
That's shocking!

304
00:23:09,306 --> 00:23:11,266
We can't lose to them!

305
00:23:11,308 --> 00:23:13,727
Nezuko, let's practice
coordinating our attacks.

306
00:23:15,562 --> 00:23:16,647
First Form!

307
00:23:17,856 --> 00:23:19,024
Second Form!

308
00:23:20,442 --> 00:23:21,652
Third Form!

309
00:23:24,947 --> 00:23:26,740
Pretty nice, Nezuko!

310
00:23:28,784 --> 00:23:31,745
Next, Episode 10,
"Together Forever".

311
00:23:31,745 --> 00:23:33,872
I'll leave the Temari woman
in your hands.

312
00:23:33,914 --> 00:23:35,249
Let's battle together!

313
00:23:36,792 --> 00:23:39,962
(To be continued)
