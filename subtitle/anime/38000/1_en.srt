1
00:00:25.234 --> 00:00:26.360
Why?

2
00:00:29.738 --> 00:00:32.074
Why did something like this happen?

3
00:00:34.493 --> 00:00:35.994
Nezuko, don't die!

4
00:00:35.994 --> 00:00:37.120
Don't die!

5
00:00:39.414 --> 00:00:41.625
I'll save you!

6
00:00:43.418 --> 00:00:44.878
I won't let you die!

7
00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:50.425
I'll definitely save you!

8
00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:04.064
Tanjiro.

9
00:01:07.526 --> 00:01:09.403
Your face is so dirty.

10
00:01:10.028 --> 00:01:11.321
Come here quickly.

11
00:01:14.074 --> 00:01:15.909
It's snowing,
so it's very dangerous.

12
00:01:15.993 --> 00:01:17.870
It's okay if you don't go out.

13
00:01:18.537 --> 00:01:22.875
I want everyone to have
a full meal for the New Year.

14
00:01:23.542 --> 00:01:25.377
That's why I want
to sell more charcoal.

15
00:01:26.545 --> 00:01:27.754
Thank you.

16
00:01:29.673 --> 00:01:30.716
Tanjiro!

17
00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.386
Are you going to town today?

18
00:01:34.553 --> 00:01:36.263
I want to go too!

19
00:01:38.056 --> 00:01:39.057
No.

20
00:01:39.433 --> 00:01:42.060
You guys can't walk
as fast as Tanjiro.

21
00:01:42.436 --> 00:01:43.812
Mom!

22
00:01:44.021 --> 00:01:45.022
No, you can't go.

23
00:01:45.522 --> 00:01:47.900
He won't be able
to use the cart today.

24
00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:50.903
So you won't be able to rest
when you're tired.

25
00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.823
Tanjiro!

26
00:01:56.366 --> 00:01:58.118
I want to go with you!

27
00:01:58.577 --> 00:02:00.495
I'll help you sell charcoal too!

28
00:02:01.413 --> 00:02:02.956
Thank you, Hanako.

29
00:02:03.624 --> 00:02:05.959
But you should stay at home today.

30
00:02:09.463 --> 00:02:10.547
You too, Shigeru.

31
00:02:10.672 --> 00:02:13.717
I'll bring back
some delicious food for you.

32
00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:14.885
Really?

33
00:02:14.968 --> 00:02:16.011
Yes.

34
00:02:17.971 --> 00:02:20.849
Hanako, I'll tell you a story
when I get back.

35
00:02:21.141 --> 00:02:22.142
Okay!

36
00:02:22.351 --> 00:02:23.352
Good girl.

37
00:02:23.644 --> 00:02:25.604
Thank you, Tanjiro.

38
00:02:27.231 --> 00:02:28.524
Then, I'll head out now.

39
00:02:29.233 --> 00:02:30.317
Takeo!

40
00:02:30.317 --> 00:02:32.236
Just do the best you can.

41
00:02:32.361 --> 00:02:33.987
Help me chop some wood, will you?

42
00:02:34.488 --> 00:02:37.115
I know how to chop wood!

43
00:02:37.824 --> 00:02:40.536
I just wanted to do it with you.

44
00:02:42.871 --> 00:02:43.914
Good boy.

45
00:02:43.914 --> 00:02:45.415
What are you doing?

46
00:02:45.415 --> 00:02:47.084
Takeo is embarrassed!

47
00:02:47.084 --> 00:02:48.585
Be quiet!

48
00:02:48.627 --> 00:02:49.837
Good boy!

49
00:02:49.837 --> 00:02:51.588
Don't touch my head!

50
00:02:56.927 --> 00:02:58.887
Come home early!

51
00:02:59.638 --> 00:03:01.306
Be careful on the road!

52
00:03:06.895 --> 00:03:08.063
Tanjiro!

53
00:03:09.231 --> 00:03:10.315
Nezuko!

54
00:03:10.607 --> 00:03:12.943
I have to put Rokuta to sleep.

55
00:03:13.735 --> 00:03:15.112
Otherwise, he'd definitely
scream and cry.

56
00:03:15.904 --> 00:03:18.866
Everyone feels lonely
after Dad passed away.

57
00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:24.621
So that's probably why
we're all so attached to you.

58
00:03:26.957 --> 00:03:28.292
Stay safe on the road!

59
00:03:31.795 --> 00:03:33.672
Although life isn't easy,

60
00:03:34.423 --> 00:03:35.674
we're really happy.

61
00:03:36.675 --> 00:03:39.887
But life is just like the weather.

62
00:03:40.929 --> 00:03:43.390
It's constantly changing.

63
00:03:44.516 --> 00:03:46.685
It won't stay sunny forever...

64
00:03:47.186 --> 00:03:49.605
and snow won't fall endlessly.

65
00:03:50.647 --> 00:03:51.690
But...

66
00:03:52.482 --> 00:03:54.484
when happiness shatters,

67
00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:56.153
it's always...

68
00:03:57.112 --> 00:03:58.822
accompanied by the smell of blood.

69
00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:09.750
Oh, it's Tanjiro!

70
00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:12.836
You still came down the mountain
on a day like this?

71
00:04:12.878 --> 00:04:14.755
You're so hardworking!

72
00:04:15.214 --> 00:04:16.548
Be careful of catching a cold!

73
00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:18.467
This weather is nothing!

74
00:04:18.717 --> 00:04:19.760
Would you like to buy some charcoal?

75
00:04:19.801 --> 00:04:21.053
Do you have enough in your house?

76
00:04:21.428 --> 00:04:23.138
Hey, Tanjiro!

77
00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:25.807
I want to buy some charcoal!

78
00:04:26.391 --> 00:04:29.686
Thank you so much for helping me
with my paper door last time.

79
00:04:29.978 --> 00:04:31.772
I also want to buy some charcoal!

80
00:04:35.817 --> 00:04:39.446
Tanjiro, you came
just at the right time!

81
00:04:40.239 --> 00:04:43.116
I've been accused of
breaking this plate!

82
00:04:43.158 --> 00:04:44.701
Please help me!

83
00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:46.245
Help me smell this.

84
00:04:50.666 --> 00:04:52.125
There's the smell of a cat.

85
00:04:52.626 --> 00:04:53.836
I told you!

86
00:04:54.086 --> 00:04:55.838
Oh, it was the cat that did it?

87
00:04:55.963 --> 00:04:58.006
I told you it wasn't me!

88
00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:59.466
Tanjiro!

89
00:04:59.675 --> 00:05:03.220
Could you help me move these things?

90
00:05:07.683 --> 00:05:09.476
It's already late.

91
00:05:10.394 --> 00:05:13.021
But luckily,
I sold all the charcoal.

92
00:05:14.815 --> 00:05:16.108
Tanjiro!

93
00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:20.070
Are you going back up the mountain?

94
00:05:20.487 --> 00:05:21.989
It's too dangerous.
Don't go back now.

95
00:05:22.573 --> 00:05:25.117
I have a sharp nose! I'll be fine.

96
00:05:25.826 --> 00:05:27.536
I'll let you stay at my place
for the night.

97
00:05:27.828 --> 00:05:29.705
Come here.

98
00:05:30.914 --> 00:05:31.915
But...

99
00:05:31.915 --> 00:05:33.417
Say no more. Come, quick!

100
00:05:34.418 --> 00:05:35.961
The demons are coming out.

101
00:05:50.225 --> 00:05:51.476
I'm finished now.

102
00:05:57.399 --> 00:05:58.567
Mr. Saburo.

103
00:05:59.109 --> 00:06:00.694
What are the demons you mentioned?

104
00:06:01.904 --> 00:06:03.071
Since a long time ago,

105
00:06:03.113 --> 00:06:05.699
human-devouring demons come out
after the sun goes down.

106
00:06:08.535 --> 00:06:11.872
That's why you shouldn't
wander about at night.

107
00:06:12.664 --> 00:06:13.916
Sleep once you're done
with your meal.

108
00:06:13.957 --> 00:06:16.168
Just wake up earlier tomorrow
and head home.

109
00:06:20.797 --> 00:06:21.965
Demons...

110
00:06:22.216 --> 00:06:25.093
They won't go
into people's homes, right?

111
00:06:25.802 --> 00:06:28.514
No, they will.

112
00:06:31.892 --> 00:06:32.976
Then...

113
00:06:33.227 --> 00:06:35.604
Everyone would get eaten
by the demons.

114
00:06:38.398 --> 00:06:42.152
That's why there are demon slayers
who help us kill them.

115
00:06:42.486 --> 00:06:43.862
They've existed
since a long time ago.

116
00:06:46.114 --> 00:06:47.658
I'm turning off the lights.

117
00:06:48.033 --> 00:06:49.243
Go to sleep.

118
00:06:52.454 --> 00:06:53.830
Mr. Saburo.

119
00:06:54.164 --> 00:06:56.542
All of his family have passed away,
so he's living alone.

120
00:06:56.875 --> 00:06:58.293
He must feel really lonely.

121
00:06:59.253 --> 00:07:01.588
I'll bring my brothers here
next time.

122
00:07:02.297 --> 00:07:03.507
There's nothing to be afraid of.

123
00:07:03.507 --> 00:07:04.967
There are no demons in this world.

124
00:07:05.175 --> 00:07:06.260
It's fine.

125
00:07:07.344 --> 00:07:09.346
But come to think of it,

126
00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:11.890
Grandma once
told me the same story...

127
00:07:12.015 --> 00:07:13.642
before she passed away.

128
00:07:19.648 --> 00:07:20.941
Stay safe!

129
00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:33.370
When happiness shatters,

130
00:07:34.162 --> 00:07:35.205
there's always...

131
00:07:42.754 --> 00:07:44.173
The smell of blood.

132
00:08:07.279 --> 00:08:08.655
Nezuko!

133
00:08:09.198 --> 00:08:10.282
What happened to you?

134
00:08:10.407 --> 00:08:11.867
What's going on?

135
00:08:12.451 --> 00:08:13.994
What happened?

136
00:08:20.125 --> 00:08:21.376
Mom!

137
00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:29.676
Mom...

138
00:08:29.968 --> 00:08:31.053
Hanako!

139
00:08:32.054 --> 00:08:33.055
Takeo...

140
00:08:33.597 --> 00:08:34.598
Shigeru...

141
00:08:35.474 --> 00:08:36.725
Nezuko...

142
00:08:36.892 --> 00:08:38.101
Rokuta...

143
00:08:46.318 --> 00:08:48.654
Nezuko's body is
the only one that is still warm!

144
00:08:49.863 --> 00:08:52.115
If I bring her to the doctor,
she could still be saved!

145
00:08:52.866 --> 00:08:54.993
How could something
like this happen?

146
00:08:56.245 --> 00:08:57.454
Did a bear do this?

147
00:08:57.496 --> 00:08:59.790
Was it a bear
that doesn't hibernate?

148
00:09:06.171 --> 00:09:07.923
I can't breathe!

149
00:09:08.048 --> 00:09:09.550
My lungs hurt...

150
00:09:09.591 --> 00:09:10.926
from breathing in this ice-cold air.

151
00:09:11.510 --> 00:09:13.136
I have to keep moving!

152
00:09:13.345 --> 00:09:15.681
I have to walk faster.

153
00:09:16.390 --> 00:09:18.684
There's still a long way to go
until I get to town.

154
00:09:18.809 --> 00:09:20.018
Hurry!

155
00:09:20.894 --> 00:09:22.771
I can't let Nezuko die!

156
00:09:25.274 --> 00:09:26.859
I'll save you!

157
00:09:27.609 --> 00:09:29.862
I'll save you.

158
00:09:38.453 --> 00:09:39.538
Oh no!

159
00:09:48.005 --> 00:09:49.214
I'm safe.

160
00:09:49.882 --> 00:09:51.091
Thanks to the snow.

161
00:09:51.842 --> 00:09:53.719
But it's also the snow
that made me slip.

162
00:09:55.637 --> 00:09:56.889
Nezuko!

163
00:10:03.145 --> 00:10:04.188
Nezuko!

164
00:10:04.271 --> 00:10:05.439
Are you okay?

165
00:10:06.773 --> 00:10:08.192
Don't walk.

166
00:10:08.233 --> 00:10:10.402
I'll carry you to town!

167
00:10:11.236 --> 00:10:12.487
Nezuko!

168
00:10:21.663 --> 00:10:23.582
Is it...

169
00:10:24.666 --> 00:10:25.751
a demon?

170
00:10:27.252 --> 00:10:30.130
I just remembered
what Mr. Saburo told me.

171
00:10:31.548 --> 00:10:33.550
Nezuko is a human-devouring demon.

172
00:10:33.926 --> 00:10:34.927
No!

173
00:10:35.010 --> 00:10:36.345
Nezuko is a human!

174
00:10:36.428 --> 00:10:37.888
She was always a human
since she was born!

175
00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:42.392
But this is no longer the scent
of the usual Nezuko.

176
00:10:43.644 --> 00:10:45.771
But Nezuko definitely isn't
the one responsible for that!

177
00:10:46.104 --> 00:10:48.482
She was lying on the ground,
protecting Rokuta.

178
00:10:48.524 --> 00:10:51.318
There was no blood
on her mouth or hands.

179
00:10:52.069 --> 00:10:53.612
Also, there's another...

180
00:10:53.737 --> 00:10:55.489
There's another scent.

181
00:11:00.244 --> 00:11:02.579
Nezuko's body has grown!

182
00:11:04.665 --> 00:11:06.667
And she has become much stronger!

183
00:11:07.793 --> 00:11:10.420
While I was sleeping comfortably
at someone else's house,

184
00:11:10.629 --> 00:11:12.840
they were going through
something so terrifying.

185
00:11:13.841 --> 00:11:15.133
It must have hurt.

186
00:11:15.551 --> 00:11:16.885
You must have suffered.

187
00:11:18.387 --> 00:11:19.721
I'm so sorry...

188
00:11:19.847 --> 00:11:21.014
I couldn't save all of you!

189
00:11:22.683 --> 00:11:25.227
But I want to at least
do something for Nezuko!

190
00:11:25.352 --> 00:11:27.312
However, she's too strong!

191
00:11:27.312 --> 00:11:28.689
I can't fight back!

192
00:11:29.439 --> 00:11:30.649
Nezuko!

193
00:11:30.774 --> 00:11:32.401
You can do it, Nezuko!

194
00:11:32.651 --> 00:11:34.069
You have to control yourself!

195
00:11:34.069 --> 00:11:35.529
Do it for my sake!

196
00:11:36.947 --> 00:11:38.657
You can't become a demon!

197
00:11:38.907 --> 00:11:40.284
Stay strong!

198
00:11:40.492 --> 00:11:41.702
You can do it!

199
00:11:42.452 --> 00:11:43.996
You can do it!

200
00:12:16.236 --> 00:12:17.487
What happened?

201
00:12:21.867 --> 00:12:22.868
Who are you?

202
00:12:27.623 --> 00:12:28.749
A sword?

203
00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:31.293
Why are you protecting her?

204
00:12:31.668 --> 00:12:32.878
She's my sister!

205
00:12:33.086 --> 00:12:34.588
She's my little sister!

206
00:12:37.758 --> 00:12:39.051
Nezuko!

207
00:12:42.804 --> 00:12:44.640
Is that your sister?

208
00:13:00.614 --> 00:13:01.657
Nezuko!

209
00:13:01.657 --> 00:13:02.866
Don't move.

210
00:13:06.745 --> 00:13:09.540
My job is to slay evil demons.

211
00:13:09.706 --> 00:13:12.960
So I'll have to chop
your sister's head off too.

212
00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:14.753
Wait!

213
00:13:14.753 --> 00:13:16.755
Nezuko didn't kill anyone!

214
00:13:17.673 --> 00:13:19.383
There was another scent
of someone...

215
00:13:19.424 --> 00:13:21.885
that I don't know in my house.

216
00:13:22.302 --> 00:13:23.554
I think the one
who killed everyone...

217
00:13:24.888 --> 00:13:26.390
has to be that guy.

218
00:13:26.557 --> 00:13:28.267
It's not Nezuko!

219
00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:31.186
I don't know why
she became like this.

220
00:13:32.187 --> 00:13:33.188
But...

221
00:13:33.730 --> 00:13:35.190
The reason is simple.

222
00:13:35.732 --> 00:13:39.653
If demon blood touches your wound,
you'll turn into a demon yourself.

223
00:13:40.696 --> 00:13:43.407
That's how human-eating
demons increase their numbers.

224
00:13:43.991 --> 00:13:46.368
Nezuko wouldn't eat humans!

225
00:13:46.910 --> 00:13:48.245
I can't believe you said that.

226
00:13:48.871 --> 00:13:52.040
Didn't she just almost eat you up?

227
00:13:52.958 --> 00:13:53.959
No!

228
00:13:54.251 --> 00:13:56.753
Nezuko must
have recognized who I am!

229
00:13:57.212 --> 00:13:59.339
I won't let anyone hurt her!

230
00:13:59.506 --> 00:14:01.592
Nezuko will definitely turn back
into a human-being!

231
00:14:01.884 --> 00:14:03.594
I'll heal her!

232
00:14:04.219 --> 00:14:05.554
She can't be saved.

233
00:14:05.888 --> 00:14:07.097
Once you become a demon,

234
00:14:07.097 --> 00:14:09.057
you can't turn back.

235
00:14:09.516 --> 00:14:10.642
I'll find something!

236
00:14:10.684 --> 00:14:12.978
I'll definitely find a way!

237
00:14:13.312 --> 00:14:15.022
Please don't kill her!

238
00:14:15.522 --> 00:14:18.233
I'll find that scoundrel
who killed my family!

239
00:14:18.275 --> 00:14:20.903
I'll accomplish it all!

240
00:14:20.903 --> 00:14:22.237
So...

241
00:14:22.571 --> 00:14:23.822
So...

242
00:14:24.072 --> 00:14:26.033
Please don't kill her!

243
00:14:26.491 --> 00:14:27.701
Don't take...

244
00:14:27.993 --> 00:14:29.745
any more people away from me.

245
00:14:31.580 --> 00:14:33.165
Please stop.

246
00:14:33.999 --> 00:14:35.125
I beg you.

247
00:14:35.375 --> 00:14:38.045
Please don't kill my little sister!

248
00:14:39.004 --> 00:14:40.380
I'm begging you!

249
00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:43.091
I'm begging you...

250
00:14:51.725 --> 00:14:55.187
Don't ever let others take control
over your life and death!

251
00:14:56.522 --> 00:14:59.149
Don't plead with others in misery!

252
00:14:59.316 --> 00:15:01.193
If that was helpful,

253
00:15:01.193 --> 00:15:03.654
your family
wouldn't have been killed!

254
00:15:04.238 --> 00:15:06.031
A weakling
who can't even take control...

255
00:15:06.031 --> 00:15:07.616
of a situation when he's
on the verge of being attacked...

256
00:15:07.616 --> 00:15:08.992
says he wants to heal his sister...

257
00:15:09.034 --> 00:15:10.744
and find his enemy!

258
00:15:11.245 --> 00:15:12.871
How hilarious!

259
00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:16.416
Weaklings don't have
the right to choose!

260
00:15:16.583 --> 00:15:18.168
No matter how hard you try,

261
00:15:18.168 --> 00:15:20.254
you're still doomed
to succumb to the strong!

262
00:15:20.546 --> 00:15:22.214
Perhaps the demons know...

263
00:15:22.256 --> 00:15:24.174
the way to heal your sister.

264
00:15:24.508 --> 00:15:26.385
But don't expect...

265
00:15:26.385 --> 00:15:29.721
that they'll respect your willpower
and your pleas!

266
00:15:30.055 --> 00:15:32.599
Of course,
I don't respect you either.

267
00:15:32.808 --> 00:15:34.226
This is reality.

268
00:15:34.268 --> 00:15:37.187
Why did you let your sister
tackle you just now?

269
00:15:37.563 --> 00:15:39.690
Do you think you're protecting
her that way?

270
00:15:39.815 --> 00:15:41.900
Why didn't you lift your ax?

271
00:15:41.942 --> 00:15:44.069
Why did you turn your back to me?

272
00:15:44.111 --> 00:15:45.320
Your incompetence...

273
00:15:45.362 --> 00:15:47.030
is what led to her capture!

274
00:15:47.197 --> 00:15:50.701
I should've pierced my sword
through you and your sister!

275
00:15:53.704 --> 00:15:54.913
Don't cry.

276
00:15:55.163 --> 00:15:56.623
Don't lose hope.

277
00:15:56.999 --> 00:15:59.168
That's not what
you should be doing right now.

278
00:16:00.252 --> 00:16:02.921
I know you can't take
any more shocks now.

279
00:16:03.338 --> 00:16:04.882
Your family was killed...

280
00:16:04.882 --> 00:16:06.508
and your little sister turned
into a human-devouring demon.

281
00:16:06.675 --> 00:16:07.926
You must be in pain.

282
00:16:08.510 --> 00:16:10.137
You want to scream out loud,
don't you?

283
00:16:11.263 --> 00:16:12.347
I understand it all.

284
00:16:13.473 --> 00:16:16.602
If I had arrived half a day earlier,

285
00:16:16.935 --> 00:16:19.563
maybe your family
wouldn't have died.

286
00:16:20.230 --> 00:16:23.734
But I have no way to turn back time.

287
00:16:24.860 --> 00:16:25.986
Let your anger build up.

288
00:16:26.486 --> 00:16:29.156
That strong, pure anger
from vowing to be merciless...

289
00:16:29.156 --> 00:16:30.532
will become the unwavering force...

290
00:16:30.532 --> 00:16:32.576
that drives your limbs.

291
00:16:33.243 --> 00:16:35.037
A weak determination...

292
00:16:35.412 --> 00:16:38.457
can't protect or heal your sister...

293
00:16:38.457 --> 00:16:41.543
and it definitely
can't avenge your family.

294
00:16:41.585 --> 00:16:42.586
Sto...

295
00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:46.548
Stop!

296
00:17:01.063 --> 00:17:03.857
Blindly attacking
under the influence of emotions.

297
00:17:04.274 --> 00:17:05.442
How foolish!

298
00:17:20.082 --> 00:17:21.250
Where's his ax?

299
00:17:30.467 --> 00:17:32.719
Before he hid in the forest...

300
00:17:33.762 --> 00:17:35.639
Not only did he throw a stone at me,

301
00:17:35.722 --> 00:17:38.684
but he also threw his ax up
in the air.

302
00:17:39.935 --> 00:17:42.271
He didn't want me to know
that he was unarmed.

303
00:17:42.521 --> 00:17:45.148
So he purposely turned to his side
so that I wouldn't see his hands.

304
00:17:46.441 --> 00:17:48.861
He knew he wouldn't be
able to defeat me.

305
00:17:49.778 --> 00:17:53.532
So he wanted to take me down
when I slashed him.

306
00:17:54.867 --> 00:17:56.326
This kid...

307
00:18:01.206 --> 00:18:02.332
Crap!

308
00:18:02.374 --> 00:18:03.500
She's going to eat him!

309
00:18:08.005 --> 00:18:09.256
Nezuko!

310
00:18:13.010 --> 00:18:14.636
Nezuko is different.

311
00:18:16.889 --> 00:18:18.640
She won't eat humans.

312
00:18:22.352 --> 00:18:23.437
Someone...

313
00:18:24.021 --> 00:18:25.731
once said the same thing before,

314
00:18:25.772 --> 00:18:27.482
but he was devoured
by the demon in the end.

315
00:18:28.609 --> 00:18:30.694
When demons are famished,

316
00:18:30.903 --> 00:18:33.363
they'll even kill and eat
their parents and siblings...

317
00:18:34.281 --> 00:18:36.074
because they're high in nutrients.

318
00:18:36.867 --> 00:18:39.786
I've seen that scenario
too many times already.

319
00:18:41.079 --> 00:18:43.540
The girl is injured badly.

320
00:18:43.957 --> 00:18:47.127
Her body must be using a lot
of energy to heal her wounds...

321
00:18:47.544 --> 00:18:49.046
and an immense amount of strength
must have been drained...

322
00:18:49.087 --> 00:18:51.632
when she transformed into a demon.

323
00:18:51.965 --> 00:18:53.592
Without a doubt, she must be...

324
00:18:53.675 --> 00:18:55.427
suffering from
extreme starvation right now.

325
00:18:56.553 --> 00:19:00.724
She's probably dying to gobble up
human blood and flesh.

326
00:19:01.558 --> 00:19:03.143
She's protecting him.

327
00:19:03.435 --> 00:19:05.270
And that threatening look
she's giving me...

328
00:19:08.273 --> 00:19:09.399
Perhaps...

329
00:19:10.025 --> 00:19:11.109
there's something different...

330
00:19:11.693 --> 00:19:13.487
about these two siblings.

331
00:19:31.004 --> 00:19:33.549
I'm sorry for leaving you behind,

332
00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:34.842
Tanjiro.

333
00:19:35.926 --> 00:19:38.262
Please take care of Nezuko.

334
00:19:49.731 --> 00:19:50.941
Are you awake?

335
00:19:54.278 --> 00:19:56.697
Go find an old man named
Urokodaki Sakonji...

336
00:19:56.697 --> 00:19:59.408
who lives
at the foot of Sagiri Mountain.

337
00:20:00.909 --> 00:20:03.787
Just tell him Tomioka Giyu sent you.

338
00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:08.125
It'll be fine
since the sun isn't out,

339
00:20:08.625 --> 00:20:11.128
but don't ever let your sister
out in the sunlight.

340
00:20:28.645 --> 00:20:29.938
Let's go.
