1
00:00:58,058 --> 00:01:02,521
(Demon Slayer)

2
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:21,767
(Episode 7: Kibutsuji Muzan)

3
00:02:44,498 --> 00:02:45,541
Nezuko.

4
00:02:46,792 --> 00:02:48,001
Don't chase after him.

5
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:49,253
Come back here.

6
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:51,839
Come over here.

7
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:58,762
Nezuko.

8
00:03:08,105 --> 00:03:09,731
Master Urokodaki said that...

9
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:12,818
Nezuko is a demon now.

10
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:19,157
She's not so weak
as to require my protection.

11
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:23,412
Can I really let her handle it?

12
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:26,415
If she can help me protect them,

13
00:03:26,707 --> 00:03:28,250
I can focus on attacking.

14
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:43,849
Nezuko.

15
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,733
Nezuko, I'm going down there.

16
00:03:53,442 --> 00:03:54,943
You must protect them well.

17
00:03:58,739 --> 00:03:59,865
You can do that, right?

18
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:31,021
I'm in the swamp.

19
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,733
And these...

20
00:04:41,532 --> 00:04:44,743
Could these be the clothes and items
of those who were kidnapped?

21
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:51,083
I can't believe he killed
so many innocent people.

22
00:04:51,834 --> 00:04:53,001
Unforgivable.

23
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:56,755
That's unforgivable.

24
00:05:01,593 --> 00:05:03,512
You must be having a hard time, kid.

25
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:06,723
There's almost no oxygen
in the swamp.

26
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:09,101
And your body
must feel very heavy...

27
00:05:09,101 --> 00:05:11,687
after being surrounded
by the swamp's darkness.

28
00:05:13,939 --> 00:05:16,066
Your body isn't as agile
as it is on land.

29
00:05:16,108 --> 00:05:17,192
Serves you right.

30
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:19,444
I can't believe you jumped in
so rashly.

31
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:21,113
What a stupid guy!

32
00:05:33,792 --> 00:05:35,502
Don't belittle me.

33
00:05:35,836 --> 00:05:39,464
Where do you think I trained?

34
00:05:40,382 --> 00:05:42,009
The air in Sagiri Mountain...

35
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:44,136
is even thinner than this place.

36
00:05:51,602 --> 00:05:52,644
And I can only...

37
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:57,649
fully use my technique
when I'm underwater.

38
00:06:09,411 --> 00:06:10,495
I can't believe...

39
00:06:10,579 --> 00:06:12,581
they can move at this angle
in the swamp!

40
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:14,666
However, it doesn't matter.

41
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:18,086
I can only use my sword to attack
them when they come near me.

42
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:20,464
A form that I can use
at such an unstable place...

43
00:06:20,464 --> 00:06:22,257
where I don't have a place to stand.

44
00:06:23,592 --> 00:06:26,720
I'm going to twist my upper
and lower body vigorously...

45
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:28,847
to form a strong whirlpool.

46
00:06:39,691 --> 00:06:40,817
I smell it.

47
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:42,194
The opening thread.

48
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:44,071
Total Concentration Breathing.

49
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:46,031
Water Breathing!

50
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:48,033
Sixth Form!

51
00:06:49,701 --> 00:06:51,578
Whirlpool!

52
00:07:23,861 --> 00:07:25,153
I don't feel good.

53
00:07:25,487 --> 00:07:26,613
I must go up quickly.

54
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:30,576
Nezuko.

55
00:07:57,769 --> 00:07:59,813
This girl is so strong.

56
00:08:03,901 --> 00:08:06,695
She doesn't even know
how to use any powers,

57
00:08:06,737 --> 00:08:08,655
but she's already so incredible.

58
00:08:09,114 --> 00:08:13,327
She must have gotten a lot of blood.

59
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:21,293
She moves so quickly.

60
00:08:21,293 --> 00:08:23,337
I can't return to the swamp!

61
00:08:24,171 --> 00:08:29,092
However, I'm starting to get used
to this kind of monotonous attack.

62
00:08:33,305 --> 00:08:35,891
Even if my neck is about to break
from her kicking...

63
00:08:36,475 --> 00:08:38,936
and my internal organs
have burst from her beating,

64
00:08:38,936 --> 00:08:41,813
demons can immediately
return to their original state!

65
00:08:51,406 --> 00:08:52,491
All right.

66
00:08:52,824 --> 00:08:56,036
I'll make a hole in your face!

67
00:09:02,751 --> 00:09:04,378
Don't touch my sister!

68
00:09:20,435 --> 00:09:21,687
Did he kill them?

69
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:23,063
Did this guy...

70
00:09:23,188 --> 00:09:24,773
kill both of my other selves?

71
00:09:29,278 --> 00:09:30,404
Your bodies...

72
00:09:30,821 --> 00:09:32,906
have an oily, rotting smell.

73
00:09:33,866 --> 00:09:35,492
It's an extremely unpleasant stench.

74
00:09:36,201 --> 00:09:38,620
How many humans
have you killed exactly?

75
00:09:39,121 --> 00:09:42,291
If those girls continue living,

76
00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:45,335
they would become ugly
and taste bad.

77
00:09:45,502 --> 00:09:47,546
So I ate them
out of the goodness in my heart!

78
00:09:49,882 --> 00:09:52,843
Why aren't you thanking
demons like us?

79
00:09:58,348 --> 00:09:59,433
That's enough.

80
00:10:06,481 --> 00:10:09,234
Regarding Kibutsuji Muzan,

81
00:10:09,234 --> 00:10:10,444
tell me everything you know.

82
00:10:27,336 --> 00:10:28,545
Tell me everything.

83
00:10:30,589 --> 00:10:31,590
Tell me!

84
00:10:33,842 --> 00:10:35,093
I can't tell you.

85
00:10:40,682 --> 00:10:41,975
I can't tell you.

86
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:56,406
I can't tell you.

87
00:11:01,036 --> 00:11:02,621
I can't.

88
00:11:04,414 --> 00:11:06,542
You can't tell him.

89
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:11,964
You can't tell anyone about me.

90
00:11:15,509 --> 00:11:17,928
I'll immediately know
if you open your mouth.

91
00:11:17,928 --> 00:11:20,639
I'm always watching you.

92
00:11:24,059 --> 00:11:26,812
I can't tell you!

93
00:11:27,688 --> 00:11:29,231
I can't tell you!

94
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,609
He's scared to the bones.

95
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:34,486
I can smell him trembling.

96
00:11:36,655 --> 00:11:38,991
I can't tell you!

97
00:11:56,341 --> 00:11:59,219
I wasn't able to get
any information again.

98
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:08,020
Nezuko!

99
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:15,777
She fell asleep.

100
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:18,030
Blood also stopped flowing.

101
00:12:18,363 --> 00:12:20,407
Is she sleeping to recover?

102
00:12:26,872 --> 00:12:27,873
I'm sorry.

103
00:12:27,915 --> 00:12:28,916
I'm sorry.

104
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:30,709
Wait a little bit more.

105
00:12:31,418 --> 00:12:34,713
I'll surely turn you back
into a human again.

106
00:12:59,696 --> 00:13:00,697
Mr. Kazumi.

107
00:13:02,157 --> 00:13:03,450
Are you all right?

108
00:13:06,495 --> 00:13:08,455
I lost my fiancée.

109
00:13:09,665 --> 00:13:11,583
You think I'll be all right?

110
00:13:17,172 --> 00:13:18,257
Mr. Kazumi.

111
00:13:20,884 --> 00:13:23,470
Even if we keep losing,

112
00:13:23,971 --> 00:13:25,722
we don't have a choice
but to live on.

113
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:29,184
We must live on no matter
how strong the blow we receive.

114
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:33,939
What do you know?

115
00:13:34,106 --> 00:13:36,024
What does a child like you know?

116
00:13:55,669 --> 00:13:57,171
I'm leaving now.

117
00:14:00,632 --> 00:14:01,675
This is for you.

118
00:14:04,511 --> 00:14:08,557
I hope Ms. Satoko's stuff
is in there.

119
00:14:31,038 --> 00:14:32,915
Did you also have
a similar experience?

120
00:14:33,707 --> 00:14:34,833
Is that the case?

121
00:14:39,755 --> 00:14:40,756
I'm...

122
00:14:40,881 --> 00:14:42,007
I'm sorry.

123
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:43,759
I was too harsh.

124
00:14:44,051 --> 00:14:45,677
Please forgive me.

125
00:14:47,012 --> 00:14:48,472
I'm really sorry.

126
00:14:54,686 --> 00:14:56,104
His hand is full of wounds.

127
00:14:56,647 --> 00:14:58,732
It became hard and thick
due to training.

128
00:15:00,651 --> 00:15:02,611
That shouldn't be
the hand of a young man.

129
00:15:04,738 --> 00:15:07,658
Please take care of that girl.

130
00:15:10,327 --> 00:15:11,620
All right.

131
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:14,373
All right.

132
00:15:30,305 --> 00:15:31,723
It's not just me.

133
00:15:33,016 --> 00:15:34,893
Exactly how many did you kill...

134
00:15:35,102 --> 00:15:37,688
that brought so many people
suffering and pain?

135
00:15:39,398 --> 00:15:40,774
Kibutsuji Muzan.

136
00:15:41,483 --> 00:15:45,070
I definitely won't spare you!

137
00:15:54,329 --> 00:15:57,457
The next destination
is Asakusa, Tokyo.

138
00:15:57,624 --> 00:16:00,544
Rumor has it that there are demons
lurking in the area.

139
00:16:03,046 --> 00:16:04,590
Am I going to
the next destination immediately?

140
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:06,466
Go.

141
00:16:07,134 --> 00:16:09,011
Wait.

142
00:16:09,136 --> 00:16:10,429
No.

143
00:16:10,429 --> 00:16:14,808
- No. Just a brief moment. Wait.
- Cut the crap. Go now.

144
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:39,708
I can't believe there's
so much progress in the city.

145
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:41,502
It's obviously night time,
yet it's so bright.

146
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:51,887
The houses are all so high.

147
00:16:52,095 --> 00:16:53,430
What's that?

148
00:16:54,556 --> 00:16:55,807
The so-called city...

149
00:16:56,225 --> 00:16:57,684
The city.

150
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:09,905
I'm so dizzy.

151
00:17:13,367 --> 00:17:14,785
Let's go there, Nezuko.

152
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,790
I'm sorry to disturb you.

153
00:17:39,601 --> 00:17:41,061
Excuse me.

154
00:17:42,062 --> 00:17:44,439
I would like to have yamakake udon.

155
00:17:44,898 --> 00:17:46,191
I'll serve it right away.

156
00:17:53,866 --> 00:17:56,326
It's my first time
coming to such a place.

157
00:17:56,827 --> 00:17:58,328
It's too crowded.

158
00:18:06,545 --> 00:18:09,548
Here is your yamakake udon.

159
00:18:10,048 --> 00:18:11,508
Thank you.

160
00:18:47,628 --> 00:18:48,837
This smell...

161
00:18:49,296 --> 00:18:51,465
Why did it suddenly appear
in this place?

162
00:18:59,515 --> 00:19:01,391
This was the smell
that remained at home.

163
00:19:05,687 --> 00:19:07,231
Kibutsuji Muzan.

164
00:19:10,901 --> 00:19:13,111
That guy has that smell!

165
00:19:28,335 --> 00:19:29,837
It's him.

166
00:19:31,255 --> 00:19:32,297
Dad.

167
00:19:37,344 --> 00:19:38,512
Who are you?

168
00:19:40,806 --> 00:19:45,102
- This guy...
- It's fine. Don't be scared.

169
00:19:46,061 --> 00:19:48,730
I can't believe that he has
disguised himself as a human.

170
00:19:51,024 --> 00:19:53,277
What's the matter?

171
00:19:53,819 --> 00:19:56,363
You look flustered.

172
00:19:57,531 --> 00:19:59,408
What's the matter?
Is something wrong?

173
00:19:59,908 --> 00:20:01,118
Mom.

174
00:20:10,627 --> 00:20:11,920
They're humans.

175
00:20:13,338 --> 00:20:14,882
The woman and child...

176
00:20:15,048 --> 00:20:16,550
are emitting a human smell.

177
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,137
Don't they know?

178
00:20:20,846 --> 00:20:22,264
Don't they know?

179
00:20:23,473 --> 00:20:24,850
He is a demon.

180
00:20:26,185 --> 00:20:27,686
He is a human-eating demon.

181
00:20:29,688 --> 00:20:31,064
Do you know him?

182
00:20:31,648 --> 00:20:33,066
No.

183
00:20:33,609 --> 00:20:35,736
How troubling.

184
00:20:37,112 --> 00:20:39,114
I haven't seen this kid before.

185
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:45,996
Perhaps he's mistaken.

186
00:20:47,414 --> 00:20:48,498
I see.

187
00:20:55,547 --> 00:20:57,716
Dear, what's wrong?

188
00:21:05,974 --> 00:21:07,184
Dear.

189
00:21:11,313 --> 00:21:12,356
Stop!

190
00:23:00,005 --> 00:23:01,006
(Demon Slayer)

191
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:05,344
I finally found Kibutsuji Muzan.

192
00:23:05,344 --> 00:23:06,345
As long as I defeat him,

193
00:23:06,386 --> 00:23:07,638
Nezuko would turn back into a human.

194
00:23:09,223 --> 00:23:12,976
By the way, the people in Asakusa
are so fashionable.

195
00:23:13,852 --> 00:23:15,687
I think it would
suit you too, Nezuko.

196
00:23:16,146 --> 00:23:19,024
Now, let me tell you
a Taisho secret!

197
00:23:19,441 --> 00:23:22,194
Mr. Toyo from the udon restaurant
was born and raised in Asakusa.

198
00:23:22,194 --> 00:23:23,695
I heard that because he loves
Asakusa so much,

199
00:23:23,695 --> 00:23:26,323
he opened an udon place there.

200
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:29,326
If I wear a suit,

201
00:23:29,326 --> 00:23:31,286
I think I would look more mature.

202
00:23:31,787 --> 00:23:33,539
Right, I should return
to my mission.

203
00:23:33,622 --> 00:23:36,583
Next, Episode 8,
"The Smell of Enchanting Blood".

204
00:23:36,875 --> 00:23:39,878
