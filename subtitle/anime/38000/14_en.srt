1
00:00:02,294 --> 00:00:03,337
Move!

2
00:00:04,963 --> 00:00:06,882
Pull out your sword and fight,

3
00:00:06,965 --> 00:00:08,926
you coward!

4
00:00:15,349 --> 00:00:16,475
Never mind.

5
00:00:16,975 --> 00:00:20,687
I'll stab you and the box together.

6
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:25,901
Stop!

7
00:00:27,277 --> 00:00:31,782
I said stop!

8
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:48,799
(Demon Slayer)

9
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:07,920
(Episode 14: The House
with the Wisteria Family Crest)

10
00:02:08,045 --> 00:02:10,839
I said stop!

11
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:25,145
He cracked his ribs!

12
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:27,940
Aren't you part of
the Demon Slayer Corps?

13
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:31,693
Don't you get why Zenitsu
refuses to draw his sword at you?

14
00:02:32,486 --> 00:02:35,113
That's because it's a taboo
for Demon Slayer Corps...

15
00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:36,532
to draw their swords
and fight one another.

16
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:40,452
You harm your members
while ignoring the taboo.

17
00:02:40,911 --> 00:02:42,162
Is it fun for you?

18
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:45,499
You're so despicable.

19
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:56,760
So that's what that was about.

20
00:02:57,219 --> 00:02:58,595
I get it now.

21
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:03,058
Why don't we fight
with our bare hands?

22
00:03:03,058 --> 00:03:04,059
No.

23
00:03:04,059 --> 00:03:05,811
I don't think you get what I mean.

24
00:03:06,103 --> 00:03:07,104
First of all,

25
00:03:09,273 --> 00:03:11,692
it's wrong for members to fight.

26
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:15,279
I'm not saying it's okay
to fight barehanded.

27
00:03:15,279 --> 00:03:16,905
Listen to me!

28
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:31,879
That guy is really flexible.

29
00:03:32,171 --> 00:03:34,756
Even after Tanjiro broke his ribs.

30
00:03:50,022 --> 00:03:51,273
Truth be told,

31
00:03:51,815 --> 00:03:54,234
didn't Tanjiro break the taboo too?

32
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:56,195
He broke that guy's ribs.

33
00:04:14,463 --> 00:04:16,381
This fellow...

34
00:04:19,468 --> 00:04:21,720
His attacks are bizarrely low.

35
00:04:22,054 --> 00:04:23,514
It's like...

36
00:04:23,847 --> 00:04:24,932
It's as if...

37
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:28,435
I'm fighting
with a four-legged beast.

38
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:32,189
I need to stay low.

39
00:04:32,189 --> 00:04:35,067
I need to be lower than my opponent.

40
00:04:40,948 --> 00:04:43,242
This kind of flexibility...

41
00:04:43,659 --> 00:04:45,494
surpasses a normal human being.

42
00:04:48,497 --> 00:04:50,290
I'm amazing, right?

43
00:04:50,582 --> 00:04:52,918
I'm amazing, right?

44
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:55,045
He said that twice.

45
00:04:55,504 --> 00:04:56,713
He's singing his own praises.

46
00:04:57,339 --> 00:05:00,759
I can even do this.

47
00:05:06,682 --> 00:05:08,475
Stop doing that!

48
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:10,811
You broke your ribs.
Stop joking around!

49
00:05:10,894 --> 00:05:12,104
It'll worsen your condition.

50
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:15,691
I hope it gets worse.

51
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:17,234
There's nothing better...

52
00:05:17,276 --> 00:05:19,820
than the feeling you get
the moment a condition gets worse.

53
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:22,739
You should think about the future.

54
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:24,616
I don't care.

55
00:05:27,119 --> 00:05:32,833
Calm yourself down!

56
00:05:34,001 --> 00:05:35,043
Hey, that sound.

57
00:05:35,085 --> 00:05:36,879
Did they crack their skulls?

58
00:05:50,601 --> 00:05:51,685
A girl?

59
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:54,354
That face!

60
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:57,107
What about it?

61
00:05:59,318 --> 00:06:02,154
Do you have something
to say about my face?

62
00:06:04,448 --> 00:06:06,325
This is making me uncomfortable.

63
00:06:06,825 --> 00:06:10,621
He has a girl's face despite having
a body full of muscles.

64
00:06:11,288 --> 00:06:14,708
Why are you staring at my face?

65
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,710
Nothing!

66
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:18,378
I'm not staring at you.

67
00:06:20,506 --> 00:06:22,132
I have nothing to say
about your face.

68
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:24,092
Small and exquisite.

69
00:06:24,218 --> 00:06:26,303
Porcelain white skin.
I think you look good.

70
00:06:26,345 --> 00:06:27,846
I'm going to kill you!

71
00:06:27,846 --> 00:06:28,931
Come at me!

72
00:06:28,931 --> 00:06:29,973
No way.

73
00:06:29,973 --> 00:06:31,433
I will not fight you again.

74
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:33,560
Use your headbutt on me again!

75
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,686
I will not headbutt you now.

76
00:06:34,686 --> 00:06:36,396
Come on! Butt my head!

77
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,106
Please sit down!

78
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:39,191
Are you all right?

79
00:06:39,358 --> 00:06:41,193
Hey, wide forehead.

80
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,195
I'll tell you my name.

81
00:06:43,612 --> 00:06:45,697
I'm Hashibira Inosuke.

82
00:06:45,781 --> 00:06:47,115
You better remember it.

83
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:48,700
How do you write it?

84
00:06:49,034 --> 00:06:50,494
Write?

85
00:06:50,953 --> 00:06:53,497
I can't read or write.

86
00:06:54,039 --> 00:06:55,040
But my name...

87
00:06:55,165 --> 00:06:56,792
is written on my loincloth.

88
00:06:59,503 --> 00:07:00,587
What's wrong?

89
00:07:01,046 --> 00:07:02,464
He froze?

90
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:06,426
What's the matter with you?

91
00:07:19,523 --> 00:07:20,899
He collapsed!

92
00:07:21,024 --> 00:07:22,860
Is he dead?

93
00:07:23,485 --> 00:07:24,528
He's not dead.

94
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:26,655
It's probably a concussion.

95
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:29,867
It's because I went all out
to butt my head against his.

96
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:32,536
Are you okay?

97
00:07:33,871 --> 00:07:34,997
You're amazing!

98
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:36,665
Can I touch your head?

99
00:07:36,665 --> 00:07:37,749
Sure.

100
00:07:39,084 --> 00:07:40,169
He's scary.

101
00:07:40,419 --> 00:07:42,754
Tanjiro's head
isn't bleeding at all.

102
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:44,673
I wonder how hard his head is.

103
00:07:45,674 --> 00:07:47,843
He can even knock the boar down.

104
00:07:48,927 --> 00:07:51,138
Your head is so hard.

105
00:07:52,181 --> 00:07:53,390
Really?

106
00:07:54,975 --> 00:08:02,900
(Demon Slayer)

107
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:22,878
He's awake!

108
00:08:22,878 --> 00:08:25,297
A duel!

109
00:08:25,339 --> 00:08:26,381
- Hey!
- He's acting like that...

110
00:08:26,381 --> 00:08:27,591
as soon as he's up!

111
00:08:27,591 --> 00:08:29,176
These types of people
are my absolute fear.

112
00:08:29,426 --> 00:08:30,761
Let's duel!

113
00:08:39,311 --> 00:08:41,063
What are you doing?

114
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:43,190
Burying the dead.

115
00:08:45,734 --> 00:08:47,361
You can help too, Inosuke.

116
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:50,781
There are still other corpses
in the mansion.

117
00:08:51,615 --> 00:08:54,910
What's the point
of burying all these corpses?

118
00:08:55,494 --> 00:08:56,620
I'm not doing it.

119
00:08:56,662 --> 00:08:57,746
I refuse to help.

120
00:08:57,913 --> 00:08:58,997
Put that aside.

121
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:00,374
Let's have a duel now.

122
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,627
This guy is weird.

123
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:05,587
He even asked what the point is.

124
00:09:07,506 --> 00:09:08,590
Is that it?

125
00:09:09,758 --> 00:09:11,760
You can't help us out
because you're badly injured?

126
00:09:15,472 --> 00:09:16,974
These two are doomed.

127
00:09:17,432 --> 00:09:18,892
None of them are sane.

128
00:09:19,434 --> 00:09:20,978
No, it's all right.

129
00:09:21,228 --> 00:09:24,398
Everyone tolerates pain differently.

130
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:27,693
Moving these corpses out...

131
00:09:27,776 --> 00:09:29,403
and burying them...

132
00:09:29,486 --> 00:09:30,904
is hard work.

133
00:09:31,446 --> 00:09:33,657
Zenitsu and I will work hard
with the children.

134
00:09:33,699 --> 00:09:34,783
Don't worry.

135
00:09:35,993 --> 00:09:36,994
He'll definitely misunderstand.

136
00:09:37,786 --> 00:09:38,954
He'll definitely misunderstand.

137
00:09:40,998 --> 00:09:42,833
Rest well, Inosuke.

138
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:46,795
Sorry for forcing you
when you're injured.

139
00:09:48,547 --> 00:09:49,965
Don't look down on me!

140
00:09:50,257 --> 00:09:52,009
I don't care if there are
100 or 200 corpses.

141
00:09:52,009 --> 00:09:53,427
I'll show you how I bury them!

142
00:09:53,468 --> 00:09:56,263
I'm better at burying corpses
than anyone else!

143
00:10:09,985 --> 00:10:12,029
What is he doing?

144
00:10:12,029 --> 00:10:13,155
Don't look at him.

145
00:10:21,163 --> 00:10:24,499
Hurry, get down the mountain.

146
00:10:26,543 --> 00:10:28,212
That crow talks.

147
00:10:28,754 --> 00:10:30,547
Don't think about anything.

148
00:10:32,174 --> 00:10:36,178
Okay, follow me.

149
00:10:43,936 --> 00:10:44,937
Hey.

150
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:46,230
Where are you going?

151
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:48,357
Getting down the mountain.

152
00:10:48,649 --> 00:10:50,651
Our duel hasn't ended.

153
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:52,277
You must be tired, right?

154
00:10:52,611 --> 00:10:53,946
It's okay, let's go down.

155
00:10:55,364 --> 00:10:57,157
I'm not tired at all!

156
00:10:58,408 --> 00:10:59,868
Let's duel!

157
00:11:05,624 --> 00:11:08,836
No!

158
00:11:08,836 --> 00:11:11,964
Don't leave me, Shoichi!

159
00:11:12,047 --> 00:11:13,590
Shoichi, you're strong!

160
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:16,969
I need you to protect me!

161
00:11:17,135 --> 00:11:19,471
Shoichi doesn't want to protect you.

162
00:11:19,555 --> 00:11:21,765
Don't leave me alone here!

163
00:11:21,765 --> 00:11:23,392
Behave yourself!

164
00:11:29,606 --> 00:11:30,983
Give me your hand.

165
00:11:34,903 --> 00:11:36,613
This will help you ward off demons.

166
00:11:36,905 --> 00:11:38,532
You of rare blood...

167
00:11:38,699 --> 00:11:40,284
should carry it with you.

168
00:11:40,993 --> 00:11:42,619
It's the scent of wisteria.

169
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:44,454
Wisteria?

170
00:11:44,746 --> 00:11:46,540
Demons fear wisterias.

171
00:11:46,874 --> 00:11:48,125
You should carry it with you.

172
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:51,962
Ward off demons.

173
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:57,217
Thank you very much.

174
00:11:57,759 --> 00:11:59,803
We can go home
by ourselves from here.

175
00:12:00,888 --> 00:12:01,889
Have a safe journey.

176
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,809
Okay.

177
00:12:05,809 --> 00:12:09,396
Follow me now.

178
00:12:16,028 --> 00:12:17,279
Let's duel!

179
00:12:17,571 --> 00:12:20,782
I'll find your flaw and beat you!

180
00:12:20,866 --> 00:12:22,576
Call me by my name.

181
00:12:22,618 --> 00:12:24,286
I'm Kamado Tanjiro.

182
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:26,830
Kamaboko Konpachiro.

183
00:12:27,122 --> 00:12:28,290
I'll beat you.

184
00:12:28,874 --> 00:12:30,292
Who do you mean?

185
00:12:30,292 --> 00:12:31,293
You!

186
00:12:31,335 --> 00:12:32,503
You got the wrong person!

187
00:12:33,212 --> 00:12:34,546
Shut up!

188
00:12:40,469 --> 00:12:42,846
(Wisteria)

189
00:12:44,306 --> 00:12:46,058
It's the Wisteria Family Crest.

190
00:12:48,727 --> 00:12:51,647
Take a rest.

191
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:53,315
Those who are injured,

192
00:12:53,315 --> 00:12:55,817
rest until you're recovered.

193
00:12:56,944 --> 00:12:58,195
Can I really rest?

194
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:02,199
Although I fought with demons
with an injured body this time.

195
00:13:03,033 --> 00:13:04,243
Cough.

196
00:13:04,576 --> 00:13:06,578
Cough? What do you mean?

197
00:13:06,787 --> 00:13:08,247
I'm going to eat this bird.

198
00:13:12,376 --> 00:13:13,460
Hi.

199
00:13:15,003 --> 00:13:16,880
Sorry to bother you
at this late hour.

200
00:13:17,256 --> 00:13:19,174
Monster!

201
00:13:19,174 --> 00:13:20,175
Watch your words!

202
00:13:20,342 --> 00:13:22,010
Who are you?

203
00:13:23,428 --> 00:13:26,056
You guys are demon slayers, right?

204
00:13:26,473 --> 00:13:28,100
You look weak.

205
00:13:28,183 --> 00:13:29,309
That's rude!

206
00:13:29,434 --> 00:13:30,769
Please come in.

207
00:13:37,192 --> 00:13:39,278
That old lady is quick on her feet.

208
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:42,239
Please come this way.

209
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,663
Clean clothes for everyone.

210
00:13:51,832 --> 00:13:54,376
Food for everyone.

211
00:13:55,169 --> 00:13:56,795
She's a monster, Tanjiro!

212
00:13:56,879 --> 00:13:58,380
That old lady is a monster!

213
00:13:58,380 --> 00:13:59,965
She moves weirdly fast.

214
00:13:59,965 --> 00:14:01,049
She must be a monster!

215
00:14:01,049 --> 00:14:02,384
Monster old lady.

216
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:10,017
Use chopsticks.

217
00:14:22,154 --> 00:14:24,114
Since you're so hungry,

218
00:14:24,323 --> 00:14:25,532
you can have this too.

219
00:14:28,493 --> 00:14:29,578
Here you go.

220
00:14:29,578 --> 00:14:31,288
No!

221
00:14:31,288 --> 00:14:35,209
He totally forgot about the box.

222
00:14:35,209 --> 00:14:38,545
Are you kidding me, stupid eyebrows?

223
00:14:43,509 --> 00:14:45,886
Your beds are ready.

224
00:14:46,345 --> 00:14:48,388
Monster old lady appeared!

225
00:14:49,848 --> 00:14:51,517
First come, first serve.

226
00:14:51,558 --> 00:14:53,018
I'm sleeping here.

227
00:14:53,727 --> 00:14:54,811
Sure.

228
00:14:54,937 --> 00:14:56,188
Sleep wherever you like.

229
00:14:57,814 --> 00:14:59,399
Zenitsu, where would you sleep?

230
00:15:02,736 --> 00:15:03,946
You idiot!

231
00:15:05,072 --> 00:15:07,533
The doctor is here to treat you.

232
00:15:07,574 --> 00:15:08,659
Hello.

233
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:12,663
Yes.

234
00:15:14,248 --> 00:15:15,374
Seriously injured.

235
00:15:20,379 --> 00:15:23,423
All three of us have broken ribs.

236
00:15:23,966 --> 00:15:27,177
(Two ribs, Three ribs, Four ribs)

237
00:15:29,054 --> 00:15:31,765
My head hurts more than my ribs.

238
00:15:32,307 --> 00:15:33,308
I'm sorry.

239
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:35,686
You should apologize to me.

240
00:15:36,144 --> 00:15:37,145
It seriously hurts.

241
00:15:37,771 --> 00:15:39,731
I was punched and kicked by you.

242
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:41,441
Apologize now.

243
00:15:41,692 --> 00:15:42,776
I refuse.

244
00:15:43,068 --> 00:15:44,152
Apologize now!

245
00:15:44,194 --> 00:15:46,113
- I refuse.
- You should apologize.

246
00:15:47,155 --> 00:15:50,492
If not, we won't eat with you.

247
00:15:51,785 --> 00:15:53,203
What do you mean?

248
00:15:53,704 --> 00:15:56,707
Food tastes better
when everyone eats together.

249
00:15:57,165 --> 00:15:58,250
That's true.

250
00:15:58,709 --> 00:16:00,836
Are your brains all right?

251
00:16:00,836 --> 00:16:02,671
You have no right to say that!

252
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:06,175
Do you need anything else?

253
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:08,302
- Monster!
- Cut it out!

254
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:12,181
(Wisteria)

255
00:16:12,222 --> 00:16:13,932
According to the Kasugai crow,

256
00:16:14,308 --> 00:16:16,393
the family bearing
the Wisteria Family Crest...

257
00:16:16,518 --> 00:16:20,063
was rescued by demon slayers
in the past.

258
00:16:20,606 --> 00:16:24,151
Now, they offer the best hospitality
to any demon slayer they see.

259
00:16:24,818 --> 00:16:25,903
Although that was what I heard,

260
00:16:26,695 --> 00:16:28,822
I still can't believe
that we're being treated this well.

261
00:16:29,364 --> 00:16:31,617
What is the Demon Slayer Corps?

262
00:16:32,409 --> 00:16:33,660
Since you're asking that, Inosuke,

263
00:16:33,702 --> 00:16:35,537
why did you join
the Demon Slayer Corps?

264
00:16:37,372 --> 00:16:39,333
You must have a reason, right?

265
00:16:40,918 --> 00:16:43,170
A member
of the Demon Slayer Corps...

266
00:16:43,212 --> 00:16:45,130
stumbled into my territory
in the mountains.

267
00:16:45,506 --> 00:16:48,550
I dueled with him
and snatched his sword.

268
00:16:51,136 --> 00:16:53,555
What an unlucky guy.

269
00:16:54,515 --> 00:16:55,599
After that,

270
00:16:55,724 --> 00:16:58,101
I heard about the Final Selection...

271
00:16:58,393 --> 00:17:00,604
and the existence of demons.

272
00:17:01,271 --> 00:17:03,899
Is that why you joined
the Demon Slayer Corps?

273
00:17:04,233 --> 00:17:06,652
So, we're the same.

274
00:17:06,652 --> 00:17:07,903
We both grew up in the mountains.

275
00:17:08,403 --> 00:17:10,280
We're not the same.

276
00:17:10,614 --> 00:17:13,033
I don't have parents and siblings.

277
00:17:13,617 --> 00:17:16,411
My only pleasure in life...

278
00:17:16,453 --> 00:17:19,206
is to challenge other creatures
in terms of strength.

279
00:17:19,998 --> 00:17:21,083
I see.

280
00:17:21,834 --> 00:17:22,960
I see.

281
00:17:30,884 --> 00:17:31,927
Tanjiro.

282
00:17:32,261 --> 00:17:34,471
Since no one is asking, I'll do it.

283
00:17:35,848 --> 00:17:38,851
Why do you carry a demon with you?

284
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,528
Zenitsu.

285
00:17:50,112 --> 00:17:52,489
You still treat me as a friend
even after knowing this.

286
00:17:53,448 --> 00:17:55,492
Zenitsu, you're a good person.

287
00:17:56,368 --> 00:17:57,452
Thank you.

288
00:18:00,038 --> 00:18:02,749
I can't stand it
if you praise me like that.

289
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:07,045
I have a very good sense of smell.

290
00:18:07,588 --> 00:18:09,173
I can smell it from the start.

291
00:18:09,965 --> 00:18:11,633
Zenitsu,

292
00:18:12,509 --> 00:18:13,635
you're kind and strong.

293
00:18:14,178 --> 00:18:15,971
No, I'm not strong at all.

294
00:18:16,096 --> 00:18:17,181
Is this a joke?

295
00:18:17,472 --> 00:18:19,808
You stopped me
from bringing Shoichi along.

296
00:18:19,933 --> 00:18:21,143
I haven't forgiven you.

297
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:30,861
A demon is appearing.

298
00:18:30,861 --> 00:18:31,862
It's okay.

299
00:18:31,862 --> 00:18:34,531
What do you mean it's okay? Explain!

300
00:18:34,531 --> 00:18:35,699
- Keep quiet.
- Explain now!

301
00:18:35,699 --> 00:18:37,868
Zenitsu, it's midnight.

302
00:18:38,952 --> 00:18:41,163
How can he ignore being provoked?

303
00:18:41,705 --> 00:18:43,415
I even snatched his food.

304
00:18:44,249 --> 00:18:45,334
By the way,

305
00:18:45,459 --> 00:18:48,337
why was that guy angry again?

306
00:18:50,339 --> 00:18:51,548
I can't remember.

307
00:18:55,844 --> 00:18:57,930
Didn't you lock it?

308
00:18:57,930 --> 00:18:59,014
Keep quiet.

309
00:18:59,181 --> 00:19:00,766
Protect me.

310
00:19:00,766 --> 00:19:02,476
Protect me!

311
00:19:02,518 --> 00:19:04,645
Inosuke will do too!

312
00:19:04,645 --> 00:19:05,896
Don't come near me!

313
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:18,450
It's coming out!

314
00:19:19,201 --> 00:19:20,244
I need to hide.

315
00:19:20,244 --> 00:19:22,037
It's going to eat me!

316
00:19:27,292 --> 00:19:28,293
Nezuko.

317
00:19:49,147 --> 00:19:52,150
I overworked my brain.

318
00:19:54,444 --> 00:19:55,529
Zenitsu,

319
00:19:55,737 --> 00:19:56,905
Nezuko is my...

320
00:19:56,947 --> 00:19:57,948
Tanjiro.

321
00:20:01,368 --> 00:20:02,494
You...

322
00:20:04,329 --> 00:20:05,372
Zenitsu?

323
00:20:07,457 --> 00:20:09,960
You...

324
00:20:12,254 --> 00:20:14,840
You're so lucky!

325
00:20:16,425 --> 00:20:19,595
You've been carrying
such a cute girl around.

326
00:20:20,804 --> 00:20:23,515
Carrying a cute girl,

327
00:20:23,515 --> 00:20:26,685
traveling around happily every day.

328
00:20:27,686 --> 00:20:29,479
Zenitsu, it's not...

329
00:20:29,563 --> 00:20:32,316
Give me back the blood I lost!

330
00:20:32,441 --> 00:20:34,401
I...

331
00:20:34,401 --> 00:20:35,652
I didn't work my butt off...

332
00:20:35,652 --> 00:20:39,239
just so you can flirt
and have fun with a girl all day!

333
00:20:39,323 --> 00:20:44,036
Did I get punched and kicked
by the strange boar because of this?

334
00:20:44,203 --> 00:20:45,913
Zenitsu, calm down.

335
00:20:45,954 --> 00:20:47,414
Why did you change so suddenly?

336
00:20:47,414 --> 00:20:49,666
The Demon Slayer Corps...

337
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:52,628
is not a place
where you can fool around!

338
00:20:52,794 --> 00:20:55,380
People like you
should be eliminated.

339
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:56,715
Eliminated, now!

340
00:20:56,924 --> 00:20:59,510
Since you sinned
for stopping my marriage...

341
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:03,222
and letting Shoichi go,

342
00:21:03,764 --> 00:21:05,682
you should be eliminated!

343
