1
00:00:06,798 --> 00:00:09,051
Dear, what's wrong?

2
00:00:10,886 --> 00:00:11,970
Dear?

3
00:00:16,266 --> 00:00:17,309
Stop!

4
00:00:34,076 --> 00:00:38,622
(Demon Slayer)

5
00:01:55,282 --> 00:01:58,076
(Episode 8:
The Smell of Enchanting Blood)

6
00:02:00,287 --> 00:02:01,371
What?

7
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:02,456
What's going on?

8
00:02:02,497 --> 00:02:03,874
There's blood!

9
00:02:06,251 --> 00:02:07,961
Stop!

10
00:02:15,761 --> 00:02:16,845
Dear!

11
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:18,597
Ma'am.

12
00:02:18,597 --> 00:02:20,307
You're in grave danger!

13
00:02:20,516 --> 00:02:23,519
Wrap a cloth around your wound
and press on it hard.

14
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:29,149
It's all right.

15
00:02:29,191 --> 00:02:30,609
There must be a solution.

16
00:02:30,901 --> 00:02:32,945
The lady's injury is not fatal.

17
00:02:33,237 --> 00:02:34,571
Harder!

18
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:37,449
Use a rope to bind the cloth.

19
00:02:37,908 --> 00:02:39,201
It will be okay.

20
00:02:39,618 --> 00:02:41,328
This man hasn't killed anyone yet.

21
00:02:43,539 --> 00:02:45,040
Just a moment ago,

22
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:47,543
this man was just walking
around normally.

23
00:02:49,211 --> 00:02:50,546
Are you okay?

24
00:02:50,838 --> 00:02:52,256
Don't look.

25
00:02:52,798 --> 00:02:54,299
Rei, it's dangerous here.

26
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:55,551
Let's go somewhere else.

27
00:02:55,843 --> 00:02:56,885
Where is he?

28
00:03:10,107 --> 00:03:11,149
Darn it.

29
00:03:11,358 --> 00:03:12,860
Darn it!

30
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:18,699
I can't leave this man alone.

31
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:21,326
Kibutsuji Muzan.

32
00:03:21,702 --> 00:03:23,745
I will not let you off the hook!

33
00:03:23,954 --> 00:03:25,998
Wherever you go, I won't let you go!

34
00:03:27,249 --> 00:03:29,251
What's wrong with that kid?

35
00:03:29,668 --> 00:03:31,211
Do you know him, Tsukihiko?

36
00:03:35,591 --> 00:03:37,092
Don't try to escape!

37
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:39,428
I'll follow you
to the depths of hell...

38
00:03:39,428 --> 00:03:41,847
and slash off your head
with my sword!

39
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:44,516
I will never let you go!

40
00:03:45,267 --> 00:03:47,394
What's going on?

41
00:03:47,436 --> 00:03:48,812
Are you drunk?

42
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:51,398
Boy, stay away from the man.

43
00:03:51,398 --> 00:03:52,482
No way.

44
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:54,276
Bring the shackles.

45
00:03:54,276 --> 00:03:55,444
Please, I beg you.

46
00:03:55,444 --> 00:03:56,778
Say no more, let him go!

47
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:58,155
Don't do that, please.

48
00:03:58,155 --> 00:04:00,324
No one can control him but me.

49
00:04:00,324 --> 00:04:01,408
Move!

50
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:02,701
No, please stop it!

51
00:04:02,743 --> 00:04:05,204
Goodness, what happened to his face?

52
00:04:05,204 --> 00:04:06,747
Has he lost consciousness?

53
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:08,916
Drag the boy away.

54
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:10,292
Stop it, please.

55
00:04:10,292 --> 00:04:12,961
I don't want him to kill anyone.

56
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:14,630
Please don't interfere.

57
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:16,548
I'm begging you.

58
00:04:16,632 --> 00:04:17,674
Darn it.

59
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:20,719
If you keep on resisting...

60
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:28,977
Blood Bewitchment.

61
00:04:29,144 --> 00:04:30,145
Scent of Illusory Blood.

62
00:04:30,145 --> 00:04:31,146
Visual Dream.

63
00:04:32,731 --> 00:04:34,942
What fragrance is this?

64
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,945
What are these patterns?

65
00:04:40,572 --> 00:04:41,657
What's going on?

66
00:04:41,657 --> 00:04:43,450
I can't see anything around me!

67
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:45,994
Is this some kind of attack?

68
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:47,621
If it is, it's not good.

69
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:50,999
The smell is getting stronger.

70
00:04:59,883 --> 00:05:00,968
You still...

71
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:03,470
call someone a human...

72
00:05:04,346 --> 00:05:07,349
even after he became a demon.

73
00:05:08,183 --> 00:05:10,227
You even want to help him.

74
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:15,232
Well, I'll lend you a helping hand.

75
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:17,526
Why?

76
00:05:17,776 --> 00:05:18,777
You.

77
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:20,445
Your fragrance...

78
00:05:21,405 --> 00:05:22,406
That's right.

79
00:05:22,531 --> 00:05:23,782
I...

80
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,579
Although I'm a demon,
I'm a doctor too.

81
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:30,831
I plan...

82
00:05:31,081 --> 00:05:33,876
to destroy Kibutsuji Muzan.

83
00:05:38,505 --> 00:05:40,215
Dad, are you not coming?

84
00:05:40,716 --> 00:05:42,467
I have some work to do.

85
00:05:42,634 --> 00:05:44,803
I need to talk about some business.

86
00:05:45,179 --> 00:05:47,389
The commotion earlier is
making me worried.

87
00:05:48,223 --> 00:05:49,224
Dear.

88
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,684
It's all right.

89
00:05:50,934 --> 00:05:53,187
I'm just going to ask the police
about the situation.

90
00:05:53,812 --> 00:05:55,230
Okay, hop in.

91
00:05:58,942 --> 00:06:01,528
Come back early, Dad.

92
00:06:01,653 --> 00:06:04,114
I will. Be a good girl.

93
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:05,991
Please send them home.

94
00:06:06,408 --> 00:06:07,492
You may go now.

95
00:06:20,881 --> 00:06:23,509
Hey, let's go to another bar.

96
00:06:23,509 --> 00:06:25,802
Yachan, are you okay?

97
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:27,721
I'm totally fine.

98
00:06:27,763 --> 00:06:29,806
I'm not drunk.

99
00:06:30,641 --> 00:06:32,392
What are you doing?

100
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:36,897
Excuse me.

101
00:06:41,777 --> 00:06:42,945
Hey, hold it!

102
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:46,532
Sorry, I'm in a hurry.

103
00:06:47,366 --> 00:06:48,825
What did you say?

104
00:06:49,284 --> 00:06:52,996
You have pretty extravagant clothes.

105
00:06:53,372 --> 00:06:54,998
It's hurting my eyes.

106
00:06:55,374 --> 00:06:57,835
Your face looks so pale...

107
00:06:58,126 --> 00:07:00,462
as if you're going to die soon.

108
00:07:04,091 --> 00:07:05,801
Say something.

109
00:07:05,801 --> 00:07:07,344
Are you dead already?

110
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,184
Yachan!

111
00:07:14,518 --> 00:07:16,353
What have you done to my brother?

112
00:07:16,687 --> 00:07:17,729
Dear...

113
00:07:18,188 --> 00:07:19,273
He's dead!

114
00:07:19,273 --> 00:07:21,233
Yachan has stopped breathing!

115
00:07:23,193 --> 00:07:24,403
You...

116
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:47,217
Do I look that bad to you?

117
00:07:49,052 --> 00:07:51,597
Is my face really pale?

118
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,601
Do I look weak?

119
00:07:56,894 --> 00:07:59,563
As if I can't stay alive any longer?

120
00:08:00,355 --> 00:08:02,357
As if I'm going to die soon?

121
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:07,613
No.

122
00:08:08,697 --> 00:08:12,951
I am the one and only form of life
that is anywhere near perfection.

123
00:08:24,421 --> 00:08:26,381
Do you know
what will happen to you...

124
00:08:26,381 --> 00:08:28,592
if I transfer a large amount
of my blood to you?

125
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:41,188
The human body cannot withstand
the speed of mutation.

126
00:08:45,734 --> 00:08:48,153
All your cells will be damaged.

127
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:11,218
There's a demon slayer wearing
a pair of hanafuda earrings.

128
00:09:11,552 --> 00:09:13,637
I want you to bring me his head.

129
00:09:15,222 --> 00:09:16,306
Understand?

130
00:09:16,974 --> 00:09:17,975
Got it.

131
00:09:18,016 --> 00:09:19,351
As you wish.

132
00:09:30,445 --> 00:09:32,489
Those earrings...

133
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:47,963
Listen carefully!

134
00:09:48,213 --> 00:09:49,298
I...

135
00:09:49,423 --> 00:09:51,091
I'm telling you...

136
00:09:51,466 --> 00:09:53,051
that it's not about the money!

137
00:09:53,427 --> 00:09:58,348
I will never ever forgive you
if you don't eat my udon!

138
00:09:58,515 --> 00:09:59,766
Forgive me.

139
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:01,268
Please give me another bowl.

140
00:10:01,435 --> 00:10:02,477
Will you eat it?

141
00:10:02,477 --> 00:10:03,562
Yes!

142
00:10:03,562 --> 00:10:04,646
You'll eat it?

143
00:10:04,646 --> 00:10:05,731
I want to eat it!

144
00:10:06,023 --> 00:10:07,065
Good.

145
00:10:07,357 --> 00:10:08,567
You too?

146
00:10:08,734 --> 00:10:11,612
Take off the bamboo tube
if you want to eat udon!

147
00:10:11,612 --> 00:10:13,155
What is the bamboo tube for anyway?

148
00:10:13,238 --> 00:10:15,532
Hold the chopsticks!

149
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:18,869
Please give me the udon.

150
00:10:18,869 --> 00:10:20,662
I'd like two bowls, please.

151
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:22,122
Fine.

152
00:10:36,845 --> 00:10:38,222
Thanks for the food.

153
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:40,140
It's delicious.

154
00:10:40,557 --> 00:10:43,268
It's good that you understand.

155
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:44,728
Thank you. Come again.

156
00:10:46,605 --> 00:10:47,940
Sorry, Nezuko,

157
00:10:48,273 --> 00:10:49,691
for leaving you there alone.

158
00:10:51,401 --> 00:10:53,320
What's wrong, Nezuko?

159
00:11:01,537 --> 00:11:03,121
Were you waiting for me?

160
00:11:03,664 --> 00:11:07,501
I've been instructed
to guide your way there.

161
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:10,170
I can smell my way there.

162
00:11:10,504 --> 00:11:13,423
It's a place that was cast
with a Blindfold Spell.

163
00:11:13,841 --> 00:11:15,217
Do you get it now?

164
00:11:15,676 --> 00:11:17,010
Blindfold Spell?

165
00:11:17,803 --> 00:11:19,012
By the way,

166
00:11:20,931 --> 00:11:23,016
is that girl a demon too?

167
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,227
She's hideous.

168
00:11:27,688 --> 00:11:28,772
Hideous?

169
00:11:29,273 --> 00:11:30,357
Hideous?

170
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:32,609
Is he talking about some ugly woman?

171
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:34,111
Who is he talking about?

172
00:11:37,656 --> 00:11:38,949
Nezuko?

173
00:11:39,366 --> 00:11:41,326
How is she hideous?

174
00:11:41,326 --> 00:11:43,954
Look closely at her beautiful face!

175
00:11:43,954 --> 00:11:47,457
Nezuko is a popular beauty
in our hometown!

176
00:11:50,335 --> 00:11:51,420
Let's go.

177
00:11:51,545 --> 00:11:52,880
I will definitely follow you!

178
00:11:52,921 --> 00:11:55,090
But I'm telling you Nezuko
is not hideous!

179
00:11:55,716 --> 00:11:58,635
When we go somewhere brighter,
you can look carefully again!

180
00:11:58,635 --> 00:12:01,388
Wait, let's go there to take a look!

181
00:12:06,935 --> 00:12:08,395
I know now.

182
00:12:08,395 --> 00:12:10,022
Is it because of the bamboo tube?

183
00:12:10,022 --> 00:12:12,149
It's most probably
because of the bamboo tube.

184
00:12:12,149 --> 00:12:15,903
I wish you can see Nezuko's face
without the bamboo tube!

185
00:12:18,822 --> 00:12:20,073
Come in quickly.

186
00:12:20,157 --> 00:12:21,700
When there's no one around.

187
00:12:32,836 --> 00:12:35,339
There's a house this big
at the dead end of the road?

188
00:12:35,589 --> 00:12:36,757
Come here quickly.

189
00:12:37,216 --> 00:12:38,258
Listen carefully.

190
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:40,802
Don't do anything embarrassing
in front of the Lady.

191
00:12:40,802 --> 00:12:43,847
I couldn't care less
if you're dead or alive.

192
00:12:43,847 --> 00:12:46,850
I brought you here because of
the Lady's special request.

193
00:12:51,063 --> 00:12:52,064
Please come in.

194
00:12:53,148 --> 00:12:54,525
I'm back safely.

195
00:12:55,442 --> 00:12:56,777
Welcome back.

196
00:12:58,654 --> 00:13:01,281
Sorry for letting you handle
the trouble earlier.

197
00:13:01,615 --> 00:13:02,783
That lady...

198
00:13:03,367 --> 00:13:05,452
She's fine now.

199
00:13:06,537 --> 00:13:08,622
I pity her husband.

200
00:13:08,622 --> 00:13:10,541
He was caught
and thrown in a dungeon.

201
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,880
You're treating humans.

202
00:13:17,339 --> 00:13:18,715
Isn't it difficult for you?

203
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:22,845
Do you mean that us demons...

204
00:13:22,845 --> 00:13:25,889
are not able to endure
the smell of flesh and blood...

205
00:13:25,889 --> 00:13:28,267
when we're here treating humans?

206
00:13:29,935 --> 00:13:30,936
Sorry.

207
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:33,397
Cut it out.

208
00:13:33,438 --> 00:13:35,399
Why are you using violence?

209
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:39,987
I haven't introduced myself.

210
00:13:40,362 --> 00:13:42,531
My name is Tamayo.

211
00:13:42,865 --> 00:13:44,491
That kid is Yushiro.

212
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,660
I hope you can get along well.

213
00:13:52,207 --> 00:13:53,834
I don't think that's possible.

214
00:13:54,168 --> 00:13:55,836
It's not difficult for me.

215
00:13:57,421 --> 00:14:00,549
I think I'm more relaxed
than regular demons.

216
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:05,262
That's because I've spent
a lot of time to reform my body.

217
00:14:06,096 --> 00:14:08,682
Even Kibutsuji's curse is lifted.

218
00:14:10,267 --> 00:14:11,310
Curse?

219
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:13,687
You reformed your body?

220
00:14:21,904 --> 00:14:22,988
This way, please.

221
00:14:27,242 --> 00:14:29,453
Nezuko, please behave.

222
00:14:30,913 --> 00:14:32,247
It's fine.

223
00:14:32,456 --> 00:14:33,957
Please relax.

224
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,210
Sorry.

225
00:14:36,877 --> 00:14:39,630
Now, let's continue our discussion.

226
00:14:40,088 --> 00:14:43,926
We're able to live now
without eating human flesh.

227
00:14:44,801 --> 00:14:47,763
All we need is just
a few drops of human blood.

228
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:49,264
Blood?

229
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:51,225
That...

230
00:14:51,683 --> 00:14:53,977
You may feel uncomfortable.

231
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:56,772
The thing is, we buy blood
from people who need money...

232
00:14:56,897 --> 00:14:59,566
and get it by blood transfusion.

233
00:14:59,608 --> 00:15:03,403
Of course, we only take an amount
that will not affect their body.

234
00:15:04,488 --> 00:15:05,531
I see.

235
00:15:06,114 --> 00:15:10,327
That's the reason
why they don't smell like demons.

236
00:15:10,786 --> 00:15:13,539
Nonetheless, they need their fix
of human blood.

237
00:15:14,498 --> 00:15:16,875
If it's only blood, then Nezuko...

238
00:15:17,751 --> 00:15:21,046
The amount of blood
that Yushiro needs is even less.

239
00:15:21,338 --> 00:15:23,757
I turned him into a demon.

240
00:15:24,007 --> 00:15:27,511
Wait, you turned him?

241
00:15:29,388 --> 00:15:30,597
That's right.

242
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:32,766
Legend says that besides Kibutsuji,

243
00:15:32,766 --> 00:15:35,477
no one can create new demons.

244
00:15:36,019 --> 00:15:37,980
That's true in general.

245
00:15:39,022 --> 00:15:41,275
I've lived over 200 years...

246
00:15:41,275 --> 00:15:44,653
and Yushiro is the only demon
that I've created.

247
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:51,451
Two hundred years?

248
00:15:52,202 --> 00:15:54,913
After over 200 years,

249
00:15:54,913 --> 00:15:57,124
the only demon
you created is Yushiro?

250
00:15:57,291 --> 00:15:59,251
May I ask your age, Lady Tamayo?

251
00:16:00,419 --> 00:16:03,005
Never ask a woman their age!

252
00:16:03,005 --> 00:16:04,339
It hurts!

253
00:16:04,339 --> 00:16:05,340
Yushiro.

254
00:16:05,549 --> 00:16:08,093
I'll never let you go
if you hit this boy again.

255
00:16:09,052 --> 00:16:10,053
Yes.

256
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:13,557
She's still beautiful
even when she's angry.

257
00:16:15,225 --> 00:16:18,520
I hope you don't get me wrong.

258
00:16:19,354 --> 00:16:22,274
My aim is not to increase
the number of demons.

259
00:16:22,858 --> 00:16:25,110
But for those people
with incurable diseases...

260
00:16:25,527 --> 00:16:27,571
or fatal injuries,

261
00:16:27,571 --> 00:16:29,323
this is the only way
they can survive.

262
00:16:30,407 --> 00:16:32,367
When that happens,
I'll always ask them.

263
00:16:32,701 --> 00:16:34,995
Whether they
want to become a demon...

264
00:16:34,995 --> 00:16:36,914
and live a long life without aging.

265
00:16:42,002 --> 00:16:43,587
She has a pure scent...

266
00:16:43,837 --> 00:16:45,464
without any trace of lies.

267
00:16:46,173 --> 00:16:47,841
This person can be trusted.

268
00:16:49,343 --> 00:16:50,427
Lady Tamayo.

269
00:16:52,012 --> 00:16:53,847
Is there any way...

270
00:16:54,097 --> 00:16:56,183
to turn demons back into humans?

271
00:17:13,575 --> 00:17:14,868
Can you see them?

272
00:17:16,411 --> 00:17:17,496
I see them.

273
00:17:18,038 --> 00:17:19,998
I see their footprints.

274
00:17:20,707 --> 00:17:22,668
This is it.

275
00:17:26,296 --> 00:17:29,007
They headed that way...

276
00:17:32,719 --> 00:17:34,763
There are three of them...

277
00:17:35,097 --> 00:17:37,808
and they have a huge box.

278
00:17:40,769 --> 00:17:43,272
How should we kill him?

279
00:17:45,357 --> 00:17:47,317
I feel a rush of power in me.

280
00:17:47,609 --> 00:17:51,029
It's all thanks to the blood
Lord Kibutsuji shared with me.

281
00:17:52,447 --> 00:17:55,868
Of course we must kill him brutally.

282
00:17:57,494 --> 00:18:00,080
The way to turn demons back
into humans?

283
00:18:01,081 --> 00:18:02,124
There's a way.

284
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:04,251
Please tell me how.

285
00:18:04,251 --> 00:18:08,172
Don't you go near Lady Tamayo!

286
00:18:09,214 --> 00:18:10,549
Yushiro.

287
00:18:11,717 --> 00:18:13,427
I just threw him over my shoulder,
Lady Tamayo.

288
00:18:13,468 --> 00:18:14,761
I didn't hit him.

289
00:18:15,095 --> 00:18:16,471
You're not allowed to do that too.

290
00:18:16,638 --> 00:18:17,681
Yes.

291
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:19,725
It hurts.

292
00:18:20,434 --> 00:18:21,810
Please tell me.

293
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:25,480
No matter what injury or illness,

294
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:28,525
there will definitely be a medicine
or a method to cure it.

295
00:18:28,942 --> 00:18:32,446
Although there's no way
to cure that at this moment,

296
00:18:33,822 --> 00:18:35,407
I believe there will be a way.

297
00:18:37,701 --> 00:18:44,374
We'll definitely work out
the treatment for this complication.

298
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:46,460
Before that,

299
00:18:46,668 --> 00:18:49,129
I'd like your help on something.

300
00:18:50,255 --> 00:18:52,174
To produce the medicine,

301
00:18:52,174 --> 00:18:55,344
I need a large amount
of demon blood to research on.

302
00:18:56,386 --> 00:18:58,805
I have two things
to trouble you with.

303
00:18:59,556 --> 00:19:00,557
First.

304
00:19:00,891 --> 00:19:03,685
I need your sister's blood
for my research.

305
00:19:04,186 --> 00:19:05,187
Second.

306
00:19:05,354 --> 00:19:06,647
I hope you can collect...

307
00:19:06,688 --> 00:19:08,982
blood from the demons...

308
00:19:08,982 --> 00:19:11,318
who have a large amount
of Kibutsuji's blood.

309
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:16,823
Currently, Nezuko is
in a rare and special state.

310
00:19:17,533 --> 00:19:20,369
You said she was
in a coma for two years.

311
00:19:20,452 --> 00:19:23,539
It's likely that her body changed
during that time.

312
00:19:24,373 --> 00:19:27,417
Usually, after such a long time...

313
00:19:27,417 --> 00:19:31,296
not consuming any human
or animal flesh,

314
00:19:31,296 --> 00:19:34,049
there's no doubt
that she'll be more violent.

315
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:37,177
Lady Tamayo is so beautiful today.

316
00:19:37,469 --> 00:19:39,596
She'll be beautiful tomorrow too.

317
00:19:40,597 --> 00:19:43,350
But surprisingly and unusually,

318
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:45,853
Nezuko does not show those symptoms.

319
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:47,938
This miracle will be the key...

320
00:19:47,938 --> 00:19:49,857
to my research moving forward.

321
00:19:50,816 --> 00:19:51,859
Nezuko.

322
00:19:58,323 --> 00:20:01,743
My second request will be
a very tough test for you.

323
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:06,915
Those demons
that have thick Kibutsuji's blood...

324
00:20:07,124 --> 00:20:11,587
are demons who are
as powerful as Kibutsuji.

325
00:20:12,129 --> 00:20:15,340
It won't be easy to extract blood
from those demons.

326
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:17,467
Even so,

327
00:20:17,801 --> 00:20:21,013
would you be willing
to take on my request?

328
00:20:26,727 --> 00:20:28,687
If there's no other way,

329
00:20:29,146 --> 00:20:30,355
I'll do it.

330
00:20:31,064 --> 00:20:33,817
If Lady Tamayo is able
to formulate a cure...

331
00:20:33,859 --> 00:20:35,652
by researching demon blood.

332
00:20:37,029 --> 00:20:39,072
Then not only Nezuko,

333
00:20:40,324 --> 00:20:42,910
but other people
can be saved too, right?

334
00:20:46,705 --> 00:20:47,789
That's right.

335
00:20:54,713 --> 00:20:55,714
Get down!

336
00:21:08,519 --> 00:21:10,479
Have you decided how we'll kill him?

337
00:21:10,562 --> 00:21:13,106
Of course we'll kill him brutally!

338
00:22:59,963 --> 00:23:01,006
(Demon Slayer)

339
00:23:03,217 --> 00:23:06,053
Now, let me tell you
a Taisho secret!

340
00:23:06,094 --> 00:23:08,847
I heard that Yushiro's hobby
is to write in Lady Tamayo's diary.

341
00:23:08,889 --> 00:23:12,267
I heard he can
write 7 to 10 pages a day.

342
00:23:12,684 --> 00:23:14,394
I found the diary accidentally.

343
00:23:14,394 --> 00:23:15,687
Let me read out a snippet of it.

344
00:23:16,396 --> 00:23:17,523
Let's see.

345
00:23:17,523 --> 00:23:18,524
"January 10."

346
00:23:18,524 --> 00:23:20,859
"Lady Tamayo looks
as beautiful as a dream today."

347
00:23:20,859 --> 00:23:21,985
"At 5:10pm."

348
00:23:21,985 --> 00:23:24,321
"She called my name, twice."

349
00:23:24,321 --> 00:23:25,781
"Her voice is so pretty."

350
00:23:25,781 --> 00:23:27,533
"At 5:29pm."

351
00:23:27,533 --> 00:23:29,034
"Lady Tamayo stumbled
on an uneven road..."

352
00:23:29,034 --> 00:23:30,911
"when she was lost in thought."

353
00:23:31,495 --> 00:23:34,540
Next, Episode 9,
"Temari Demon and Arrow Demon".

354
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:36,500
Just pretend
I didn't take a peek at the diary.

355
00:23:37,251 --> 00:23:39,920
