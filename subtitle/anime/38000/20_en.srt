1
00:00:01,043 --> 00:00:02,586
Blood Demon Art.

2
00:00:03,295 --> 00:00:04,463
Exploding Blood.

3
00:00:12,471 --> 00:00:14,765
My bond with Nezuko...

4
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:16,975
cannot be broken...

5
00:00:17,392 --> 00:00:19,102
by anyone!

6
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:41,667
(Demon Slayer)

7
00:01:58,076 --> 00:02:00,913
(Episode 20: Pretend Family)

8
00:02:16,053 --> 00:02:17,387
Nezuko.

9
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:19,556
Nezuko.

10
00:02:22,184 --> 00:02:23,185
I won.

11
00:02:23,727 --> 00:02:24,978
I defeated him.

12
00:02:26,021 --> 00:02:27,856
Dad helped me.

13
00:02:29,316 --> 00:02:31,443
I have no idea
how the kagura dance...

14
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:34,363
that Dad passed down to me
helped me unleash that move.

15
00:02:34,863 --> 00:02:37,533
But I was saved because of that.

16
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:39,243
I won.

17
00:02:44,373 --> 00:02:45,457
That's strange.

18
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:47,709
I can't see Nezuko clearly.

19
00:02:48,752 --> 00:02:51,088
Is it because
my breath is all over the place?

20
00:02:54,842 --> 00:02:56,385
My ear is ringing so bad.

21
00:02:57,261 --> 00:03:00,055
My whole body is in pain.

22
00:03:01,849 --> 00:03:02,891
Quickly.

23
00:03:03,559 --> 00:03:05,310
I need to recover quickly.

24
00:03:07,271 --> 00:03:10,649
I have to keep fighting.

25
00:03:11,567 --> 00:03:13,485
I need to save Inosuke.

26
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:15,696
I need to hurry.

27
00:03:19,992 --> 00:03:22,119
The smell of blood
is getting stronger.

28
00:03:23,412 --> 00:03:24,538
Speaking of which,

29
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:27,124
I did not smell ashes just now.

30
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:29,793
Impossible.

31
00:03:34,006 --> 00:03:35,757
I'm sure I chopped off his head.

32
00:03:36,884 --> 00:03:39,261
Do you think you have defeated me?

33
00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:40,804
You poor thing.

34
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:44,057
Are you happy
with your pathetic delusions now?

35
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:48,103
I cut off my head
with my own thread...

36
00:03:49,021 --> 00:03:51,690
before you managed to.

37
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:54,318
I've had enough.

38
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:56,737
I want to kill you and your sister.

39
00:03:57,696 --> 00:04:00,908
I haven't been so angry
in a long time.

40
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:03,285
Stand up.

41
00:04:03,368 --> 00:04:04,453
Stand up quickly.

42
00:04:05,454 --> 00:04:07,039
Adjust your breath.

43
00:04:07,539 --> 00:04:09,458
Move quickly.

44
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:14,046
How did you not get burned?

45
00:04:14,463 --> 00:04:17,132
Only me and my thread got burned.

46
00:04:17,841 --> 00:04:20,219
I don't know
if that's your sister's power.

47
00:04:20,552 --> 00:04:23,055
But thank you
for making me impatient.

48
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:28,310
I can slice you into pieces
with no mercy now.

49
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:31,146
If only I could breathe properly,

50
00:04:31,438 --> 00:04:33,774
it won't matter how tired I am.

51
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:36,485
Blood Demon Art.

52
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:37,986
Murderous Eye Basket.

53
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:42,241
Don't panic.

54
00:04:42,366 --> 00:04:43,825
Control my breathing.

55
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:45,327
Calm down.

56
00:04:45,369 --> 00:04:46,537
If only I could calm down.

57
00:04:48,372 --> 00:04:50,707
I can't lift my hand.

58
00:05:04,054 --> 00:05:05,222
There is someone here.

59
00:05:05,973 --> 00:05:07,266
Is it Zenitsu?

60
00:05:09,977 --> 00:05:11,270
Before I arrived,

61
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,855
you did a great job holding out.

62
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:16,525
Leave the rest to me.

63
00:05:19,403 --> 00:05:21,196
One after another,

64
00:05:21,572 --> 00:05:24,366
you useless jerks
just keep getting in my way.

65
00:05:24,783 --> 00:05:25,993
Blood Demon Art.

66
00:05:31,707 --> 00:05:33,458
Cutting Thread Rotation.

67
00:05:35,711 --> 00:05:37,045
Total Concentration Breathing.

68
00:05:37,421 --> 00:05:38,839
Water Breathing.

69
00:05:39,214 --> 00:05:40,799
Eleventh Form.

70
00:05:42,885 --> 00:05:43,969
Dead Calm.

71
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:46,722
Eleventh Form?

72
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:49,683
What do you mean by "Eleventh Form"?

73
00:05:52,561 --> 00:05:53,604
What?

74
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:58,233
What happened? What did he do?

75
00:05:59,318 --> 00:06:01,153
The threads are falling...

76
00:06:01,737 --> 00:06:03,113
even before reaching him.

77
00:06:04,615 --> 00:06:06,325
Not a single thread
can get close to him.

78
00:06:07,284 --> 00:06:09,703
Did he cut off the strongest thread?

79
00:06:10,871 --> 00:06:12,623
This is impossible.

80
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:14,249
One more time.

81
00:06:24,843 --> 00:06:27,387
I caused trouble.

82
00:06:28,055 --> 00:06:31,725
I was the only obedient one...

83
00:06:32,518 --> 00:06:34,686
in this pretend family.

84
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:47,699
We caught up.

85
00:06:48,951 --> 00:06:50,327
Hey, look there.

86
00:06:59,503 --> 00:07:00,504
A demon?

87
00:07:00,587 --> 00:07:01,755
It's a child.

88
00:07:02,089 --> 00:07:04,216
Although he looks like a child,

89
00:07:04,216 --> 00:07:05,551
he's actually a demon.

90
00:07:06,218 --> 00:07:08,554
If we let him be, he'll eat humans.

91
00:07:09,304 --> 00:07:10,347
Hey.

92
00:07:11,014 --> 00:07:12,057
Hey.

93
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:13,392
Do you need my help?

94
00:07:14,518 --> 00:07:15,561
What?

95
00:07:16,061 --> 00:07:19,606
In exchange, would you help me?

96
00:07:20,315 --> 00:07:21,567
I'll do anything.

97
00:07:21,733 --> 00:07:24,361
I'll do anything for you.
Please save me!

98
00:07:24,736 --> 00:07:27,573
Well, would you be my family?

99
00:07:27,823 --> 00:07:29,741
Yes, I would!

100
00:07:29,741 --> 00:07:31,326
What are you talking about?

101
00:07:32,369 --> 00:07:34,246
Now, wake up.

102
00:08:11,158 --> 00:08:12,367
Welcome.

103
00:08:13,035 --> 00:08:16,747
From now on, you're my family.

104
00:08:42,397 --> 00:08:43,482
Drink up.

105
00:08:43,774 --> 00:08:47,361
Our whole family
got our powers from Rui.

106
00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:50,697
We were all weak demons.

107
00:08:50,948 --> 00:08:53,158
Thanks to Rui, we got our powers.

108
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:56,370
The lord admires Rui so much...

109
00:08:56,787 --> 00:08:59,915
that he allowed Rui to do this.

110
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:12,803
Do you feel it yet?

111
00:09:13,595 --> 00:09:16,723
You don't have to fear
demon slayers anymore.

112
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:21,395
Next, we'll move to the final step.

113
00:09:39,413 --> 00:09:41,456
Lift up your face.

114
00:09:45,961 --> 00:09:46,962
Congratulations.

115
00:09:47,462 --> 00:09:49,506
From now on,
you belong to our family.

116
00:10:21,872 --> 00:10:23,540
This is just a pretend family.

117
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:25,709
What?

118
00:10:25,709 --> 00:10:27,419
That's because
we're not blood-related.

119
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:29,505
We're just being pieced together.

120
00:10:30,214 --> 00:10:31,381
Sorry!

121
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:33,342
I'll behave.

122
00:10:33,383 --> 00:10:35,844
Rui, I'll practice harder.

123
00:10:36,011 --> 00:10:37,054
Please forgive me.

124
00:10:37,179 --> 00:10:38,222
I'm sorry.

125
00:10:38,263 --> 00:10:39,765
I'm not doing well enough.

126
00:10:40,557 --> 00:10:43,393
It's making me revert
to my original form sometimes.

127
00:10:52,486 --> 00:10:54,863
Stop making excuses, Mom.

128
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:00,786
Be a good mom to me.

129
00:11:01,203 --> 00:11:03,330
I understand, Rui.

130
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:08,085
Everyone is afraid
of demon slayers...

131
00:11:08,335 --> 00:11:10,212
and just wanted to have companions.

132
00:11:12,381 --> 00:11:13,715
No one...

133
00:11:13,924 --> 00:11:17,469
wants to play
this pointless pretend family.

134
00:11:18,136 --> 00:11:21,640
But those who disobey
Rui's demands or orders...

135
00:11:22,099 --> 00:11:23,433
will be cut into pieces,

136
00:11:23,642 --> 00:11:25,227
get their minds taken away,

137
00:11:25,727 --> 00:11:27,896
and get hung under the hot sun.

138
00:11:28,772 --> 00:11:30,190
I've had enough.

139
00:11:32,067 --> 00:11:34,820
I'll pretend I didn't hear that.

140
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:37,197
You're not stupid, right?

141
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:39,950
You're different than the others.

142
00:11:41,827 --> 00:11:43,287
Let's escape.

143
00:11:45,914 --> 00:11:47,875
I'm saying this because it's you.

144
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:52,921
I'm treating you as my real sister.

145
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,764
Tomorrow,

146
00:12:02,764 --> 00:12:05,893
Rui is descending the mountain
to meet the lord.

147
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:08,770
We can seize the opportunity
and run away.

148
00:12:45,182 --> 00:12:46,475
Such a pity.

149
00:13:10,332 --> 00:13:13,252
Although they're stupid, I'm not.

150
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:16,004
I caused trouble.

151
00:13:19,383 --> 00:13:21,343
Rui.

152
00:13:22,052 --> 00:13:23,387
Mom was killed.

153
00:13:24,012 --> 00:13:26,014
I think our brother was killed too.

154
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:27,724
What should we do?

155
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:30,352
The demon slayers are approaching.

156
00:13:31,937 --> 00:13:32,938
Hey.

157
00:13:35,023 --> 00:13:36,984
Shouldn't we run away?

158
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:40,904
Stop.

159
00:13:43,448 --> 00:13:44,950
You should know...

160
00:13:46,201 --> 00:13:50,122
that I hate your face
when it turns back to normal.

161
00:13:54,084 --> 00:13:55,460
What are you looking at?

162
00:13:55,961 --> 00:13:57,796
There's nothing to see here.

163
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:04,761
I was lucky to escape
with only scratches on my face.

164
00:14:06,889 --> 00:14:07,890
A demon.

165
00:14:10,976 --> 00:14:12,644
What the heck?

166
00:14:14,146 --> 00:14:15,314
That's useless.

167
00:14:15,355 --> 00:14:16,690
You can't break free.

168
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:18,692
My threads may look soft,

169
00:14:19,318 --> 00:14:21,195
but they're actually very tough.

170
00:14:23,739 --> 00:14:27,534
Let's start by dissolving
your clothes with acid.

171
00:14:28,285 --> 00:14:30,120
After that, it's your turn.

172
00:14:30,537 --> 00:14:32,247
Your body will turn slimy
in no time...

173
00:14:32,247 --> 00:14:34,041
and ready for my consumption.

174
00:14:35,292 --> 00:14:36,710
That's amazing.

175
00:14:37,002 --> 00:14:39,546
Did you release the threads
from the palm of your hands?

176
00:14:40,881 --> 00:14:42,174
Good evening.

177
00:14:43,509 --> 00:14:45,552
The moon is beautiful tonight.

178
00:15:00,067 --> 00:15:03,570
It seems like you don't want
to get along with me.

179
00:15:04,071 --> 00:15:06,615
Wait.

180
00:15:06,823 --> 00:15:07,866
Please!

181
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:11,537
I was forced to follow
the instructions.

182
00:15:11,828 --> 00:15:12,871
If I refuse,

183
00:15:12,871 --> 00:15:14,498
my limbs will be chopped off.

184
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:17,543
Is that so?

185
00:15:17,751 --> 00:15:19,294
That's really sad.

186
00:15:19,628 --> 00:15:20,879
I can help you.

187
00:15:21,046 --> 00:15:22,506
Let's get along!

188
00:15:24,049 --> 00:15:25,425
Can you help me?

189
00:15:25,843 --> 00:15:26,844
Yes.

190
00:15:27,135 --> 00:15:29,137
But for us to get along,

191
00:15:29,304 --> 00:15:31,557
I need you to answer
my questions first.

192
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:35,060
Cute little girl,

193
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:38,063
how many people have you killed?

194
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:40,524
Five.

195
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:46,196
But it was all instructed by him.

196
00:15:46,238 --> 00:15:47,656
I didn't have a choice.

197
00:15:48,365 --> 00:15:50,868
It's okay, you don't have to lie.

198
00:15:51,243 --> 00:15:52,661
It's because I know the truth.

199
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:56,456
It's amazing how you wrapped him...

200
00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:58,458
- inside a cocoon.
- Help me!

201
00:15:58,792 --> 00:16:01,211
You ate 80 people, right?

202
00:16:01,712 --> 00:16:03,714
I didn't eat a lot of people.

203
00:16:04,047 --> 00:16:05,799
I only killed five.

204
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:09,178
I came from the west.

205
00:16:09,845 --> 00:16:12,306
West, little girl.

206
00:16:12,931 --> 00:16:14,600
I hurried over...

207
00:16:14,892 --> 00:16:18,020
after I saw a lot of hanging cocoons
on the west side of the mountain.

208
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:20,939
Those who were caught
in the cocoons...

209
00:16:21,231 --> 00:16:23,442
all dissolved and died.

210
00:16:23,984 --> 00:16:27,905
There are 14 cocoons there.

211
00:16:28,947 --> 00:16:31,783
It means that 14 people died.

212
00:16:32,409 --> 00:16:35,037
I'm not angry at you.

213
00:16:35,162 --> 00:16:36,830
I just want to be sure...

214
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:38,498
about the actual number.

215
00:16:39,124 --> 00:16:41,251
Why do you need the actual number?

216
00:16:42,127 --> 00:16:43,295
Little girl,

217
00:16:43,504 --> 00:16:45,005
you need to receive
proper punishment...

218
00:16:45,005 --> 00:16:46,423
before you can get reborn again.

219
00:16:46,924 --> 00:16:47,925
Punishment?

220
00:16:47,966 --> 00:16:50,719
Only then can we get along.

221
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:54,765
If you don't get punished
for taking innocent lives,

222
00:16:54,932 --> 00:16:57,142
those who died
will never be at peace.

223
00:16:58,352 --> 00:17:00,395
I want to gouge out your eyes,

224
00:17:00,812 --> 00:17:04,149
cut open your body
and pull out your internal organs.

225
00:17:04,775 --> 00:17:06,443
Based on the number
of people you killed,

226
00:17:06,568 --> 00:17:09,279
I'll torture you appropriately.

227
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:10,989
After you endure...

228
00:17:11,323 --> 00:17:13,158
the right amount
of pain and suffering,

229
00:17:13,575 --> 00:17:15,577
your sins will be forgiven.

230
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:17,746
Let's work hard together.

231
00:17:18,956 --> 00:17:20,082
It's okay.

232
00:17:20,123 --> 00:17:23,502
You're a demon so you won't die.

233
00:17:23,669 --> 00:17:25,629
There won't be any side effects.

234
00:17:25,838 --> 00:17:27,714
Are you joking?

235
00:17:28,215 --> 00:17:30,342
Die, you witch!

236
00:17:37,808 --> 00:17:40,727
It looks like
we can't get along now.

237
00:17:42,104 --> 00:17:43,939
It's a pity.

238
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:22,936
Insect Breathing.

239
00:18:23,312 --> 00:18:24,521
Butterfly Dance.

240
00:18:25,856 --> 00:18:26,899
Caprice.

241
00:18:29,276 --> 00:18:32,070
My head is still intact.

242
00:18:33,906 --> 00:18:35,449
Is that the sword she's using?

243
00:18:36,033 --> 00:18:37,201
I understand now.

244
00:18:37,451 --> 00:18:39,703
Because of her tiny body
and weak wrists,

245
00:18:39,828 --> 00:18:41,496
she couldn't chop off my head.

246
00:18:41,997 --> 00:18:43,665
That means I can win this.

247
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:05,646
Just because
I didn't chop off your head,

248
00:19:05,854 --> 00:19:07,814
that doesn't mean you should relax.

249
00:19:08,232 --> 00:19:11,860
It's because there are swordsmen
like me who uses poison.

250
00:19:17,658 --> 00:19:19,284
Insect Hashira.

251
00:19:19,493 --> 00:19:20,911
Kocho Shinobu.

252
00:19:21,912 --> 00:19:24,206
I'm the only one from Hashira...

253
00:19:24,498 --> 00:19:27,000
who's unable to cut off
a demon's head.

254
00:19:27,376 --> 00:19:30,003
But I can make poison
that are lethal to demons.

255
00:19:30,212 --> 00:19:32,172
That's kind of amazing too, right?

256
00:19:33,966 --> 00:19:35,217
I'm sorry.

257
00:19:35,259 --> 00:19:37,553
You can't hear me
because you're dead.

258
00:19:38,554 --> 00:19:39,680
I'm so silly.

259
00:19:46,854 --> 00:19:48,230
Are you all right?

260
00:19:48,856 --> 00:19:50,858
Yes, I'm fine.

261
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,819
What happened to the demon?

262
00:19:55,362 --> 00:19:57,739
Is it okay to leave her head on?

263
00:19:58,532 --> 00:20:01,034
I killed her with the poison
concocted from wisteria flowers.

264
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:04,454
She's dead. She'll just rot away.

265
00:20:05,414 --> 00:20:08,333
I'm an expert in medicine.

266
00:20:09,084 --> 00:20:10,669
Your clothes completely dissolved.

267
00:20:10,711 --> 00:20:12,796
But it looks like you're not hurt.

268
00:20:12,963 --> 00:20:14,256
That's great!

269
00:20:18,302 --> 00:20:19,344
Now.

270
00:20:19,553 --> 00:20:24,433
I wonder where did the demon
who enslaved this little girl go.

271
00:20:25,767 --> 00:20:28,770
It seems like Mr. Tomioka
is one step ahead of me.

272
00:20:29,897 --> 00:20:32,191
Nezuko.

273
00:20:35,277 --> 00:20:37,404
Kill.

274
00:20:37,738 --> 00:20:40,949
I must kill that pair of siblings.

275
00:20:41,366 --> 00:20:42,784
Siblings.

276
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:48,540
Rui, what do you want?

277
00:20:49,124 --> 00:20:50,876
What is family to you?

278
00:20:52,211 --> 00:20:53,212
I don't know.

279
00:20:53,795 --> 00:20:56,965
I don't have the memories
from when I was human.

280
00:20:58,550 --> 00:21:02,554
Is that why you want us
to pretend to be your family?

281
00:21:03,388 --> 00:21:05,641
I thought that if I create
my own family,

282
00:21:06,016 --> 00:21:08,185
my memories can be restored.

283
00:21:10,229 --> 00:21:12,856
And that I can remember
the bond from my real family.

284
00:21:19,196 --> 00:21:20,364
Right.

285
00:21:20,948 --> 00:21:21,949
I...

286
00:21:25,661 --> 00:21:26,745
Nezuko.

287
00:22:59,922 --> 00:23:00,923
(Demon Slayer)

288
00:23:02,132 --> 00:23:03,258
It's amazing!

289
00:23:03,258 --> 00:23:05,177
You can make demon poison.

290
00:23:05,219 --> 00:23:07,638
I'm always learning about medicine.

291
00:23:07,721 --> 00:23:11,350
You don't have to be a good
swordsman to be a demon slayer.

292
00:23:11,475 --> 00:23:12,809
I see.

293
00:23:13,018 --> 00:23:15,812
Now, let me tell you
a Taisho secret!

294
00:23:15,938 --> 00:23:17,981
The poison is embedded
into my scabbard.

295
00:23:18,106 --> 00:23:21,944
Only my bladesmith and I
know the method to do that.

296
00:23:22,069 --> 00:23:23,111
All right.

297
00:23:23,111 --> 00:23:25,155
I want a unique sword
to go up the ranks quickly too.

298
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:29,535
You should first develop a way
to keep your uniform from melting.

299
00:23:29,868 --> 00:23:31,328
Why are your words so poisonous?

300
00:23:31,453 --> 00:23:34,122
Next, Episode 21,
"Against Corps Rules".

301
00:23:34,122 --> 00:23:36,041
It's good to have high ambitions.

302
00:23:36,041 --> 00:23:37,251
Work hard!

303
00:23:37,501 --> 00:23:40,003
(To be continued)
