1
00:00:03,712 --> 00:00:05,130
The Twelve Demon Moons' blood...

2
00:00:05,589 --> 00:00:07,508
should have a high concentration
of Kibutsuji's blood.

3
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:09,635
If only I have their blood,

4
00:00:10,052 --> 00:00:12,804
the research for Nezuko's cure
to turn into a human can be sped up.

5
00:00:15,474 --> 00:00:16,892
Right, Inosuke.

6
00:00:21,271 --> 00:00:23,023
Did you defeat her?

7
00:00:23,899 --> 00:00:25,943
Are you all right, Inosuke?

8
00:00:26,235 --> 00:00:28,487
I'm asking if you defeated her?

9
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:29,696
Yes, I won.

10
00:00:29,905 --> 00:00:31,073
That's not important.

11
00:00:31,198 --> 00:00:32,199
How are you feeling?

12
00:00:32,199 --> 00:00:35,619
I don't need your concern.

13
00:00:35,994 --> 00:00:37,996
Listen here, do you understand?

14
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:41,291
If you can do it, I can do it too.

15
00:00:41,667 --> 00:00:43,085
Just give me some time.

16
00:00:43,293 --> 00:00:46,547
My head will be harder than yours.

17
00:00:46,964 --> 00:00:49,424
And then...

18
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:50,843
That...

19
00:00:51,593 --> 00:00:53,053
He must be seriously injured.

20
00:00:53,846 --> 00:00:56,056
I couldn't save the others as well.

21
00:00:57,641 --> 00:00:58,725
That demon...

22
00:00:59,142 --> 00:01:01,228
smelled of terror and pain.

23
00:01:03,522 --> 00:01:06,233
She smelled like she desired to die.

24
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:13,615
What's wrong with this mountain?

25
00:01:14,658 --> 00:01:16,618
- The twelve demons are here.
- Don't move, Inosuke.

26
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:18,495
- A demon family rests here.
- Stop it, I don't need it.

27
00:01:18,704 --> 00:01:20,455
I'm fine!

28
00:01:20,539 --> 00:01:21,623
But I thought...

29
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:23,876
demons never stay together.

30
00:01:27,045 --> 00:01:28,088
It hurts!

31
00:01:31,675 --> 00:01:33,177
It hurts.

32
00:01:33,677 --> 00:01:35,762
It feels like something
is stabbing me.

33
00:01:36,013 --> 00:01:37,639
What's going on?

34
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:39,266
I'm getting pissed.

35
00:01:39,474 --> 00:01:40,934
I couldn't find Tanjiro and others.

36
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:42,019
This is bad.

37
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:43,437
Where did they go?

38
00:01:44,396 --> 00:01:45,480
Which way should I go?

39
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:48,483
Something stinks here too.

40
00:01:49,443 --> 00:01:50,903
I want to cry.

41
00:01:51,904 --> 00:01:53,363
The spiders are making weird sounds.

42
00:01:53,405 --> 00:01:55,032
It's really bothering me.

43
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:58,660
Although I know the spiders
are just desperate to live.

44
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:02,331
Seriously, it's so loud!

45
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:03,373
Pipe it down!

46
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:09,338
What in the world is that!

47
00:02:22,184 --> 00:02:26,647
(Demon Slayer)

48
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:46,018
(Episode 17:
You Must Master a Single Thing)

49
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:52,649
That spider has a human face!

50
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:55,277
What on earth! What was that?

51
00:03:55,277 --> 00:03:56,945
This must be a dream!

52
00:03:56,987 --> 00:03:58,906
Please tell me this is a dream!

53
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:00,490
If this is a dream,

54
00:04:00,532 --> 00:04:02,618
I will work twice as hard
when I'm awake!

55
00:04:02,618 --> 00:04:04,703
If I can lay on Nezuko's lap,

56
00:04:04,703 --> 00:04:06,496
I will work thrice as hard!

57
00:04:06,622 --> 00:04:08,332
I will work hard on the farm!

58
00:04:08,332 --> 00:04:09,499
I don't care if it's
300 pings or 600 pings,

59
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:11,251
I will go all out to work on it!

60
00:04:11,335 --> 00:04:13,212
So...

61
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:18,425
Wake me up from this nightmare!

62
00:04:31,355 --> 00:04:33,440
What is that?

63
00:04:34,066 --> 00:04:37,194
Are those people
turning into spiders?

64
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:40,197
Is the house floating?

65
00:04:40,489 --> 00:04:42,324
It's vaguely visible.

66
00:04:42,324 --> 00:04:43,408
Are those threads?

67
00:04:43,659 --> 00:04:45,327
Seriously, it stinks.

68
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:46,995
The smell is so pungent.

69
00:04:47,496 --> 00:04:48,747
If Tanjiro,
the master of smell, is here,

70
00:04:48,747 --> 00:04:50,040
he would've died from the stench.

71
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:52,334
The stink is making my throat sore.

72
00:04:52,668 --> 00:04:54,044
My tears are flowing.

73
00:04:54,378 --> 00:04:55,671
My eyes hurt too.

74
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:09,852
That's huge!

75
00:05:10,602 --> 00:05:12,521
It's so huge!

76
00:05:13,105 --> 00:05:14,481
It's humongous!

77
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:16,066
I can't believe it!

78
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:25,993
I'm not going to talk to you!

79
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:33,458
Running away is useless.

80
00:05:33,792 --> 00:05:35,627
You've lost this battle.

81
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:37,671
What nonsense are you spewing?

82
00:05:37,713 --> 00:05:39,590
Listen here, don't talk to me!

83
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:42,259
I hate creatures like you!

84
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:46,096
I think you should know
that you're doomed.

85
00:05:46,263 --> 00:05:47,347
What do you mean?

86
00:05:47,598 --> 00:05:49,016
Look at your hands.

87
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:50,392
What? Hands?

88
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:53,687
What's wrong with my hands?

89
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,482
This is...

90
00:05:58,317 --> 00:05:59,568
You've been poisoned.

91
00:05:59,735 --> 00:06:01,778
A spider bit you, right?

92
00:06:02,196 --> 00:06:04,573
That poison will turn you
into a spider.

93
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:09,661
In around 30 minutes,

94
00:06:09,661 --> 00:06:12,372
you'll be my slave,
crawling around on the ground.

95
00:06:15,292 --> 00:06:17,336
Look at this watch.

96
00:06:17,419 --> 00:06:18,629
Can you see it?

97
00:06:19,171 --> 00:06:21,798
When the long hand
completes one round,

98
00:06:22,132 --> 00:06:24,551
you'll turn into one of us.

99
00:06:25,219 --> 00:06:27,262
When the pointer reaches here,

100
00:06:27,304 --> 00:06:29,014
you'll feel numb and pain
at your arms and legs.

101
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:33,310
When it reaches here,
you'll feel dizzy and nauseous.

102
00:06:34,186 --> 00:06:36,563
Here, you'll feel severe pain.

103
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:39,066
Your body will shrink
and you'll lose consciousness.

104
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:41,860
After that, when you wake up...

105
00:06:53,038 --> 00:07:00,921
(Demon Slayer)

106
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:03,924
(10:55pm)

107
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:07,678
(10:56pm)

108
00:07:18,397 --> 00:07:20,148
There's no use running away anymore.

109
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:21,149
Yes.

110
00:07:21,233 --> 00:07:24,903
I know!

111
00:07:28,031 --> 00:07:29,658
What are you trying to do?

112
00:07:29,658 --> 00:07:32,077
Shut up!

113
00:07:32,286 --> 00:07:34,288
There's nothing to be afraid of.

114
00:07:34,538 --> 00:07:36,915
When the poison spread
and you become a spider,

115
00:07:36,915 --> 00:07:38,375
you will lose
all sense of consciousness.

116
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:41,670
No! I hate to be like that!

117
00:07:41,712 --> 00:07:43,630
Why don't you understand?

118
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,299
You don't have any friends
or lovers, right?

119
00:07:45,299 --> 00:07:46,633
No wonder people hate you!

120
00:07:47,676 --> 00:07:49,303
Do you want me
to give you more poison...

121
00:07:49,303 --> 00:07:51,346
so you'll turn into a spider faster?

122
00:07:56,518 --> 00:07:58,145
No, I don't want that!

123
00:07:58,187 --> 00:08:00,022
I don't want to become like that!

124
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:03,567
Get your act together!

125
00:08:03,775 --> 00:08:05,652
No crying, no quitting!

126
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:08,197
Those are meaningless actions.

127
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:09,740
Zenitsu!

128
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:11,950
Come down now.

129
00:08:12,117 --> 00:08:13,785
Continue your training!

130
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:15,787
No, I thought I was going to die!

131
00:08:15,787 --> 00:08:17,289
If I continue the training,

132
00:08:17,331 --> 00:08:19,541
I'll definitely die!

133
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:22,753
This level of training
won't kill you.

134
00:08:22,878 --> 00:08:25,005
Come down here, stupid!

135
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:26,173
Grandpa!

136
00:08:26,256 --> 00:08:28,133
Call me Master.

137
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:30,802
I really love you, Grandpa.

138
00:08:33,889 --> 00:08:38,018
The woman I love took my money
and eloped with another man.

139
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:40,979
It's Grandpa who saved me
by settling my debt.

140
00:08:41,271 --> 00:08:44,441
But maybe you just want
to train a swordsman.

141
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:47,653
I want to fulfill
your dreams too, Grandpa!

142
00:08:47,778 --> 00:08:49,446
But I can't do it!

143
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:51,907
I feel so sorry, Grandpa!

144
00:08:51,949 --> 00:08:53,283
Don't look at me like that!

145
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:55,786
I train by myself secretly too!

146
00:08:55,786 --> 00:08:57,746
I didn't even sleep!

147
00:08:57,955 --> 00:09:00,457
But I don't see any results.

148
00:09:00,499 --> 00:09:01,583
Why?

149
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:03,836
Tell me, why?

150
00:09:04,002 --> 00:09:05,754
Calm down, Zenitsu!

151
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:08,006
You have the talent.

152
00:09:08,006 --> 00:09:09,842
I'm already...

153
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:16,139
Zenitsu!

154
00:09:17,349 --> 00:09:18,934
I'm so tired of my life.

155
00:09:19,518 --> 00:09:21,353
I can't believe I got struck
by lightning too.

156
00:09:23,105 --> 00:09:25,399
Even my hair color changed.

157
00:09:27,568 --> 00:09:30,654
Although I'm thankful to be alive,

158
00:09:32,948 --> 00:09:34,032
I'm the person...

159
00:09:34,575 --> 00:09:37,035
who hates myself the most.

160
00:09:39,162 --> 00:09:41,707
I know that I need to work hard.

161
00:09:42,249 --> 00:09:43,333
But I'm really scared.

162
00:09:43,417 --> 00:09:44,459
I run away.

163
00:09:44,877 --> 00:09:46,086
I cry.

164
00:09:48,005 --> 00:09:49,089
I really want to change.

165
00:09:49,381 --> 00:09:51,425
I want to be useful.

166
00:09:52,968 --> 00:09:54,136
But...

167
00:09:54,219 --> 00:09:56,847
I have really tried my best!

168
00:09:56,972 --> 00:10:00,350
But in the end, I'm going to lose
all my hair and become a monster?

169
00:10:00,392 --> 00:10:01,435
Are you joking?

170
00:10:01,435 --> 00:10:02,811
This joke is going too far!

171
00:10:05,647 --> 00:10:07,524
What's wrong with him?

172
00:10:12,154 --> 00:10:13,572
Don't come up here!

173
00:10:13,572 --> 00:10:15,866
Just leave me alone
for a while, okay?

174
00:10:16,074 --> 00:10:19,161
Just a while!

175
00:10:25,501 --> 00:10:27,586
I've reached the hair falling stage?

176
00:10:29,087 --> 00:10:30,672
My hair is falling.

177
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:33,425
That jerk didn't tell me this!

178
00:10:44,019 --> 00:10:45,938
What's with that guy?

179
00:10:46,104 --> 00:10:49,858
Isn't he a demon slayer
who's here to kill our family?

180
00:10:50,567 --> 00:10:51,944
He fainted?

181
00:10:52,194 --> 00:10:54,029
He's such a coward.

182
00:10:56,323 --> 00:10:58,450
He'll die if he falls on his head.

183
00:10:59,117 --> 00:11:00,244
I don't get it.

184
00:11:08,252 --> 00:11:09,670
Thunder Breathing.

185
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:10,754
First Form.

186
00:11:19,596 --> 00:11:20,722
Poison Sputum.

187
00:11:28,689 --> 00:11:31,400
He can actually spin
and dodge my attacks mid-air.

188
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:32,943
Compared to before,

189
00:11:32,943 --> 00:11:34,778
he's like completely
a different person.

190
00:11:37,239 --> 00:11:38,699
Thunder Breathing.

191
00:11:38,824 --> 00:11:40,075
First Form.

192
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:42,536
Everyone, attack him!

193
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:47,624
Thunder Breathing.

194
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:48,959
First Form.

195
00:11:54,006 --> 00:11:57,217
He kept repeating the same form
since just now.

196
00:11:59,386 --> 00:12:00,679
I can't be wrong.

197
00:12:00,846 --> 00:12:02,055
This guy...

198
00:12:03,432 --> 00:12:05,934
only knows one kind of move.

199
00:12:08,145 --> 00:12:10,022
Listen here, Zenitsu.

200
00:12:10,272 --> 00:12:11,899
This is enough for you.

201
00:12:12,983 --> 00:12:15,527
As long as you can learn
this one move, we can celebrate.

202
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,323
Since you can only learn one move,

203
00:12:19,531 --> 00:12:21,283
then you must master it.

204
00:12:24,578 --> 00:12:27,581
You're going to practice the move
and achieve extreme perfection.

205
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:31,376
This is not right, Grandpa.

206
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:34,129
You were so angry
just a while ago...

207
00:12:34,796 --> 00:12:35,881
because I can only learn...

208
00:12:36,256 --> 00:12:39,259
one form out of six forms
of Thunder Breath.

209
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:43,972
Do you know how a sword is forged?

210
00:12:47,142 --> 00:12:48,143
How would I know?

211
00:12:48,477 --> 00:12:49,645
Are you going to keep hitting me?

212
00:12:49,686 --> 00:12:50,854
I'm going to cry.

213
00:12:52,773 --> 00:12:54,191
The blade is hammered...

214
00:12:54,483 --> 00:12:56,527
and refined countless times...

215
00:12:56,902 --> 00:12:59,321
to remove impurities
and excess components.

216
00:12:59,363 --> 00:13:01,156
The purity of steel
must be improved...

217
00:13:01,156 --> 00:13:03,825
so that a strong sword
can be forged.

218
00:13:04,785 --> 00:13:07,871
Is that why Grandpa
hits me hard every day?

219
00:13:10,082 --> 00:13:12,417
But I'm no steel.

220
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:14,545
I'm a living body.

221
00:13:16,755 --> 00:13:19,174
This guy is nothing great.

222
00:13:19,341 --> 00:13:21,051
A guy his level can become
a demon slayer?

223
00:13:21,718 --> 00:13:24,930
You can't move
because of the poison, right?

224
00:13:26,598 --> 00:13:28,767
Zenitsu, delve into
the extreme realm.

225
00:13:29,476 --> 00:13:30,602
It doesn't matter if you cry...

226
00:13:30,978 --> 00:13:32,396
or try to run away.

227
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,107
Never give up.

228
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:37,985
You must believe...

229
00:13:38,944 --> 00:13:41,738
that those
torturing training days...

230
00:13:42,364 --> 00:13:44,992
will definitely reward you one day.

231
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:47,327
Train to reach
the verge of extreme power.

232
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:50,330
Become a stronger sword
than everyone else.

233
00:13:51,665 --> 00:13:54,168
Specialize in one thing.

234
00:14:01,466 --> 00:14:02,467
Get lost.

235
00:14:08,098 --> 00:14:10,142
Don't make me repeat myself.

236
00:14:10,142 --> 00:14:11,268
Get lost.

237
00:14:12,686 --> 00:14:13,770
Do you understand?

238
00:14:14,897 --> 00:14:16,857
You've been crying
for the whole day.

239
00:14:16,857 --> 00:14:19,067
Don't you feel ashamed?

240
00:14:22,196 --> 00:14:23,238
Idiot.

241
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:26,825
It's a waste of time
putting effort on a guy like you.

242
00:14:27,951 --> 00:14:30,621
Master is an amazing man.

243
00:14:30,913 --> 00:14:32,206
But Grandpa...

244
00:14:33,749 --> 00:14:37,127
Don't call him Grandpa.
It's disrespectful!

245
00:14:37,628 --> 00:14:39,421
Master was a former Hashira.

246
00:14:39,838 --> 00:14:42,549
He was one of the strongest members
of the Demon Slayer Corps.

247
00:14:44,343 --> 00:14:47,763
It's a rare case to be able to train
under a former Hashira.

248
00:14:48,555 --> 00:14:52,809
Master is wasting his time,
trying to train someone like you!

249
00:14:53,018 --> 00:14:54,311
You're such a nuisance!

250
00:14:54,311 --> 00:14:55,395
Get lost!

251
00:14:55,646 --> 00:14:57,606
Why are you here anyway?

252
00:14:57,773 --> 00:14:59,942
Why are you staying here?

253
00:15:10,702 --> 00:15:12,246
Since I don't have parents,

254
00:15:12,329 --> 00:15:13,914
no one has expectations on me.

255
00:15:15,541 --> 00:15:16,542
No one...

256
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:18,252
holds hope for what I can master...

257
00:15:18,502 --> 00:15:21,421
and achieve in the future.

258
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:25,133
I want to be able to help someone,

259
00:15:25,551 --> 00:15:27,219
anyone, just one time.

260
00:15:27,594 --> 00:15:29,930
Protect someone and give someone...

261
00:15:30,347 --> 00:15:32,015
a simple yet happy future.

262
00:15:33,392 --> 00:15:34,935
No one expects that I can do it.

263
00:15:36,228 --> 00:15:38,856
All I do is cry and run away
the first time I fail.

264
00:15:40,315 --> 00:15:42,901
Everyone thinks I'm a failure
and leave my side.

265
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,572
But Grandpa was different.

266
00:15:50,909 --> 00:15:54,204
No matter how many times he tried,
he insisted on lecturing me.

267
00:15:56,498 --> 00:15:58,917
Every single time I ran away,

268
00:16:00,586 --> 00:16:04,756
he always brought me back.

269
00:16:08,218 --> 00:16:10,679
Although he beat me really hard,

270
00:16:12,556 --> 00:16:14,600
he never ever let me down.

271
00:16:16,435 --> 00:16:17,519
Stab him!

272
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:19,438
Give him more poison.

273
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:34,203
Finally, this guy...

274
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,043
What's that?

275
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:43,545
The air is shaking.

276
00:16:46,131 --> 00:16:47,341
Thunder Breathing.

277
00:16:47,341 --> 00:16:48,467
First Form.

278
00:16:49,635 --> 00:16:51,637
Thunderclap and Flash.

279
00:16:53,972 --> 00:16:55,015
Six Fold.

280
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:02,231
He disappeared.

281
00:17:23,168 --> 00:17:24,378
Did I get slashed?

282
00:17:24,628 --> 00:17:27,005
I was slashed...

283
00:17:27,923 --> 00:17:29,216
by him.

284
00:17:30,259 --> 00:17:31,718
He slashed me.

285
00:17:38,725 --> 00:17:40,352
I can't believe this.

286
00:17:40,519 --> 00:17:45,023
I was slashed by someone
who was poisoned and couldn't move.

287
00:17:53,907 --> 00:17:55,284
I had a dream.

288
00:17:56,994 --> 00:17:58,954
It was a happy dream.

289
00:17:59,621 --> 00:18:00,914
I was strong in the dream.

290
00:18:01,206 --> 00:18:02,666
Stronger than anyone else.

291
00:18:03,417 --> 00:18:07,004
I had the ability to help the weak
and others who need help.

292
00:18:07,796 --> 00:18:08,797
All the time.

293
00:18:10,132 --> 00:18:12,467
Whatever Grandpa taught me,

294
00:18:12,885 --> 00:18:16,054
all those times he spent on me
didn't go to waste.

295
00:18:17,598 --> 00:18:20,392
I became strong thanks to Grandpa.

296
00:18:20,684 --> 00:18:24,855
I helped many people in the dream.

297
00:18:26,815 --> 00:18:29,776
But I'm dying soon.

298
00:18:35,782 --> 00:18:38,160
Chuntaro...

299
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:40,662
I'm sorry.

300
00:18:53,133 --> 00:18:54,635
Don't give up!

301
00:19:04,811 --> 00:19:05,979
I can't give up.

302
00:19:06,939 --> 00:19:10,817
I need to use my breath to slow down
the poison from spreading.

303
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:13,195
Even if it's painful...

304
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:14,905
and uncomfortable,

305
00:19:15,405 --> 00:19:17,241
I must not escape the easy way.

306
00:19:17,866 --> 00:19:19,576
Grandpa will beat me.

307
00:19:21,286 --> 00:19:22,287
Right.

308
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,414
Tanjiro...

309
00:19:25,123 --> 00:19:26,333
will scold me.

310
00:19:29,753 --> 00:19:30,838
That sound just now.

311
00:19:31,463 --> 00:19:32,965
Was it thunder?

312
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:34,424
How would I know?

313
00:19:35,217 --> 00:19:37,594
I don't smell thunderclouds.

314
00:19:38,887 --> 00:19:41,181
The pungent smell is too strong.
I can't smell anything else.

315
00:19:41,974 --> 00:19:43,058
Inosuke.

316
00:19:45,143 --> 00:19:47,688
I'm going over there to have a look.

317
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,983
Whatever, suit yourself.

318
00:19:51,567 --> 00:19:53,068
Inosuke, you can descend first.

319
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,698
Descend the mountain.

320
00:19:58,156 --> 00:19:59,283
Why?

321
00:19:59,283 --> 00:20:00,325
I'm not dead yet!

322
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:02,870
Because you're seriously injured.

323
00:20:03,287 --> 00:20:05,706
I'm not injured!

324
00:20:09,668 --> 00:20:11,545
No, Inosuke.

325
00:20:11,837 --> 00:20:14,506
Anyone can see that you're injured.

326
00:20:19,469 --> 00:20:20,554
A demon.

327
00:20:21,138 --> 00:20:23,557
Because of the stench
flowing all over the mountain,

328
00:20:23,724 --> 00:20:25,184
I didn't notice her at all.

329
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:29,688
I want to cut her in half!

330
00:20:29,771 --> 00:20:31,398
Darn demon!

331
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:33,358
Don't run!

332
00:20:33,358 --> 00:20:34,526
Inosuke!

333
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:37,654
Father!

334
00:20:37,779 --> 00:20:39,406
Who's your father?

335
00:20:41,408 --> 00:20:42,534
Inosuke!

336
00:20:54,588 --> 00:21:00,219
Don't come near my family!

337
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:05,807
I'll leave the rest to you, Father.

338
00:21:10,521 --> 00:21:11,772
Water Breathing.

339
00:21:11,897 --> 00:21:13,023

00:22:59,922 --> 00:23:00,964
(Demon Slayer)

342
00:23:01,465 --> 00:23:04,426
- Stories of Demon Slayer Academy.
- Stories of Demon Slayer Academy.

343
00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:06,595
School prefects need to be
at school early.

344
00:23:06,637 --> 00:23:07,721
I didn't want to do it.

345
00:23:07,721 --> 00:23:09,389
But it's hard for me to give up...

346
00:23:09,389 --> 00:23:11,808
checking students' uniforms.

347
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:14,186
I won't get scolded
for staring at girls.

348
00:23:14,228 --> 00:23:15,646

349
00:23:19,107 --> 00:23:21,026
Makomo looks cute today.

350
00:23:21,068 --> 00:23:22,736
That senior is beautiful too.

351
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:25,197
Mr. Tomioka!

352
00:23:25,239 --> 00:23:26,281
It's not that!

353
00:23:26,281 --> 00:23:28,242
I'm just checking their uniforms.

354
00:23:28,784 --> 00:23:30,702
Before you start picking
on other students' uniforms,

355
00:23:30,744 --> 00:23:31,745
you should take care
of your hair first.

356
00:23:31,787 --> 00:23:32,955
This is really my natural hair!

357
00:23:32,955 --> 00:23:35,707
Next, Episode 18, "A Forged Bond".

358
00:23:37,334 --> 00:23:38,877
It's really my natural hair!

00:23:38,877 --> 00:23:39,962
