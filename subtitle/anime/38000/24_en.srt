1
00:00:07,549 --> 00:00:08,967
Are you going out on a mission now?

2
00:00:11,094 --> 00:00:12,179
It's you, Kocho.

3
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:14,640
I just got a new update
about a demon.

4
00:00:14,973 --> 00:00:17,434
Apparently, members who were
on the mission have been killed...

5
00:00:17,893 --> 00:00:20,062
and now, the civilians
are being taken out too.

6
00:00:20,187 --> 00:00:21,438
I can't sit back and do nothing.

7
00:00:22,231 --> 00:00:24,066
Could it be the Twelve Demon Moons?

8
00:00:24,441 --> 00:00:25,526
It could be.

9
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:27,194
It might be a demon
from the Upper Ranks.

10
00:00:27,653 --> 00:00:29,780
It seems like
it will be a difficult mission.

11
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,990
But with you personally
taking charge,

12
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:33,450
there shouldn't be a problem.

13
00:00:34,451 --> 00:00:35,494
Kocho.

14
00:00:35,494 --> 00:00:38,205
What are you planning to do
with that headbutt kid you took in?

15
00:00:38,789 --> 00:00:40,916
You said you wanted to scout
for more successors,

16
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:42,793
but it doesn't look like
you're going to make him one.

17
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:46,129
Regardless, I didn't take him in
to eat him.

18
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:47,464
Don't worry.

19
00:00:47,464 --> 00:00:48,841
Of course you won't eat humans.

20
00:00:54,513 --> 00:00:55,764
Have a safe trip.

21
00:01:09,027 --> 00:01:13,574
(Demon Slayer)

22
00:02:30,067 --> 00:02:32,986
(Episode 24:
Rehabilitation Training)

23
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,239
I can't!

24
00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:37,449
I really can't swallow this!

25
00:02:37,658 --> 00:02:39,535
You have the same reaction
every day!

26
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:42,204
You're a heavily wounded
patient, Mr. Zenitsu!

27
00:02:42,454 --> 00:02:44,206
Please hurry up
and take your medicine!

28
00:02:47,376 --> 00:02:48,460
Gosh.

29
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:50,879
Mr. Tanjiro, your medicine is here.

30
00:02:51,463 --> 00:02:52,506
Please take it.

31
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:53,590
Thank you.

32
00:02:57,719 --> 00:03:00,639
Hey, Tanjiro's medicine
is easier to swallow, isn't it?

33
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:02,850
I'm right, aren't I?
It's different from mine!

34
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:06,019
You guys are playing favorites!

35
00:03:06,061 --> 00:03:09,106
Zenitsu, we're in a hospital ward.
Be quiet.

36
00:03:09,565 --> 00:03:10,858
You're looking pretty good.

37
00:03:11,859 --> 00:03:13,235
(Slayer)

38
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:14,862
Mr. Murata!

39
00:03:15,404 --> 00:03:16,405
Hi!

40
00:03:19,074 --> 00:03:20,576
I'm glad to see
you're safe and sound.

41
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:23,495
My body almost dissolved,

42
00:03:23,579 --> 00:03:24,746
but I guess I made it through.

43
00:03:24,955 --> 00:03:27,499
I heard your injuries
are really serious.

44
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:30,127
It seems like it will take me
a bit more time to recover.

45
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:33,088
Wild boar, did you injure
your throat or something?

46
00:03:34,506 --> 00:03:36,383
What's wrong with that guy?

47
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,468
Some things happened,

48
00:03:38,677 --> 00:03:40,429
so just let him
have some time to himself.

49
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:43,182
But why did he suddenly
lose all his energy?

50
00:03:43,182 --> 00:03:44,183
Tanjiro.

51
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,810
Who is that?

52
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:49,104
This is Mr. Murata...

53
00:03:49,146 --> 00:03:50,480
who fought alongside us
at Natagumo Mountain.

54
00:03:50,606 --> 00:03:52,608
I am Murata. Nice to meet you.

55
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:54,610
Your hand...

56
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:56,445
I almost turned into a spider,

57
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:59,031
so my hands and legs
are still really short right now.

58
00:03:59,448 --> 00:04:01,742
That's why you need to eat
all this medicine!

59
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:04,369
But they taste really disgusting!

60
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:06,580
How can something taste so bad?

61
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:08,332
If your arm doesn't recover,

62
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:09,541
don't bother asking for my help.

63
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:12,002
You're so cold!
You speak so heartlessly.

64
00:04:12,127 --> 00:04:13,754
Do you know how fortunate you are?

65
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:15,130
I'm telling you, as long as you
finish all this medicine...

66
00:04:15,172 --> 00:04:16,548
and get more sunlight,

67
00:04:16,548 --> 00:04:18,967
you'll fully recover
without any long-term side effects.

68
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:21,178
I'm not eating it!

69
00:04:21,553 --> 00:04:24,556
It's just too disgusting!

70
00:04:25,182 --> 00:04:26,975
You guys seem so happy.
That's great.

71
00:04:27,226 --> 00:04:28,310
Mr. Murata.

72
00:04:28,936 --> 00:04:32,105
I was summoned
to the Hashira meeting...

73
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:34,775
to give a detailed report about
what happened at Natagumo Mountain.

74
00:04:35,317 --> 00:04:36,568
It was torturous.

75
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:39,154
The Hashira members are so scary.

76
00:04:39,321 --> 00:04:41,240
They claimed that the quality
of the recent members...

77
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,991
is absolutely terrible,

78
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:44,493
so everyone was so nervous.

79
00:04:44,952 --> 00:04:46,537
They also said...

80
00:04:46,537 --> 00:04:49,706
some people didn't follow orders
on the mountain.

81
00:04:50,207 --> 00:04:53,627
Then they started complaining
about who trained such slayers.

82
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:58,257
I don't know why they were saying
all that to someone of my rank.

83
00:05:00,217 --> 00:05:02,886
The Hashira members
are just terrifying.

84
00:05:03,637 --> 00:05:04,721
Hi, everyone.

85
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:07,808
Hashira! Lady Kocho!

86
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:08,892
Hello.

87
00:05:08,892 --> 00:05:10,978
Hello! Goodbye!

88
00:05:11,854 --> 00:05:14,147
Goodness. Bye.

89
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:17,609
How are you feeling?

90
00:05:18,402 --> 00:05:20,153
I'm feeling a lot better.

91
00:05:20,904 --> 00:05:24,867
So we can just start
your rehabilitation training.

92
00:05:25,701 --> 00:05:27,995
Rehabilitation training?

93
00:05:28,287 --> 00:05:29,288
Yes.

94
00:05:29,913 --> 00:05:31,915
I'm sorry I was too weak.

95
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:33,542
(Two weeks later)

96
00:05:33,542 --> 00:05:34,918
After Ms. Shinobu of the Hashira...

97
00:05:35,169 --> 00:05:37,296
took Tanjiro and Inosuke away,

98
00:05:37,629 --> 00:05:40,090
they started
their rehabilitation training.

99
00:05:41,175 --> 00:05:44,511
Ms. Shinobu's voice is so unique.

100
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:47,097
It gives me a feeling
I've never had before.

101
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:49,224
There's no rhythm to it at all...

102
00:05:49,224 --> 00:05:50,434
and it's a little scary.

103
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:54,271
But when she was treating people
who were turned into spiders,

104
00:05:54,271 --> 00:05:55,772
she shined like a gem.

105
00:05:56,023 --> 00:05:57,191
They all cried...

106
00:05:57,274 --> 00:05:59,193
while surrounding Ms. Shinobu.

107
00:06:00,277 --> 00:06:02,779
Also, she's really cute.

108
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,073
She could probably survive
on her looks alone.

109
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:08,535
Tanjiro and Inosuke were taken away
by such a cute girl...

110
00:06:08,577 --> 00:06:11,872
for rehabilitation training
in order to recover their stamina.

111
00:06:11,997 --> 00:06:12,998
They probably...

112
00:06:16,335 --> 00:06:18,420
They usually come back
in such a state.

113
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:21,798
You're back, Tanjiro, Inosuke.

114
00:06:22,674 --> 00:06:24,343
How were things today?

115
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:27,638
Did something happen?

116
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:29,389
What's wrong with you guys? Tell me.

117
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:31,099
Sorry.

118
00:06:32,017 --> 00:06:33,435
Just leave me alone.

119
00:06:33,977 --> 00:06:35,896
Tell me!

120
00:06:35,938 --> 00:06:37,564
Though I'm starting a bit late,

121
00:06:37,606 --> 00:06:39,816
I'll be joining the training
tomorrow too!

122
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:44,947
(The next day)

123
00:06:46,865 --> 00:06:48,909
This is frightening.

124
00:06:49,493 --> 00:06:51,453
I really don't want to go.

125
00:06:52,204 --> 00:06:55,749
Since Mr. Zenitsu will be joining us
for training starting today,

126
00:06:55,874 --> 00:06:58,210
let me explain everything again.

127
00:06:58,836 --> 00:06:59,920
First, you'll start over there.

128
00:07:00,295 --> 00:07:02,214
Your bodies have become stiff
from staying in bed for so long,

129
00:07:02,214 --> 00:07:03,715
so those girls will be helping you
relieve all that tension.

130
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:11,431
The next is reflex training.

131
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:14,518
There is liquid medicine
in the cups here.

132
00:07:14,977 --> 00:07:17,312
You must splash each other
with the medicine.

133
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:19,189
If your opponent
holds down your cup...

134
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:21,733
before you can even pick it up,

135
00:07:21,859 --> 00:07:23,360
you can't move it.

136
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:26,613
Start!

137
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:28,156
Again!

138
00:07:28,907 --> 00:07:29,908
Start!

139
00:07:31,368 --> 00:07:32,452
That's enough!

140
00:07:33,203 --> 00:07:34,955
Finally, we'll do
full-body training.

141
00:07:35,581 --> 00:07:37,916
To put it simply,
it's basically a game of tag.

142
00:07:38,584 --> 00:07:39,835
I, Aoi,

143
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:41,712
and Kanao here
will be your opponents.

144
00:07:44,882 --> 00:07:47,134
Excuse me,
could you stop for a moment?

145
00:07:48,177 --> 00:07:49,970
Is there something
you don't understand?

146
00:07:50,262 --> 00:07:51,847
No, I just have a problem.

147
00:07:52,181 --> 00:07:53,557
You two, come here.

148
00:07:54,391 --> 00:07:55,392
I'm not going.

149
00:07:56,185 --> 00:07:59,146
I told you to come here!

150
00:08:02,065 --> 00:08:05,360
Come over here, you scums!
You pieces of trash!

151
00:08:05,903 --> 00:08:07,529
What are you trying to do?

152
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:12,075
Kneel down! Kneel properly!

153
00:08:12,326 --> 00:08:14,244
You two are idiots!

154
00:08:14,286 --> 00:08:15,704
What did you say?

155
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:19,750
Inosuke!

156
00:08:22,085 --> 00:08:23,837
How could you do that, Zenitsu?

157
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:25,297
Hurry and apologize to Inosuke!

158
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:29,927
You're the one
who should apologize to me!

159
00:08:29,927 --> 00:08:31,053
You both need to say sorry!

160
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:32,387
You two were actually in paradise
this whole time,

161
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:34,556
yet you always looked like
you had come out of a fire pit!

162
00:08:34,556 --> 00:08:37,100
You were having fun
with all those girls every day!

163
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,101
Why did you always look like...

164
00:08:38,101 --> 00:08:39,311
you wanted to die
every time you came back?

165
00:08:39,311 --> 00:08:40,896
Get on your knees and apologize!

166
00:08:40,896 --> 00:08:43,440
Kill yourselves!

167
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,858
What are you saying?

168
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:46,944
Shut up, you old-fashioned
wide-forehead guy!

169
00:08:46,985 --> 00:08:48,987
Shut up and listen to me!

170
00:08:49,905 --> 00:08:52,032
You get to touch girls here...

171
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:53,283
and they massage your bodies!

172
00:08:53,283 --> 00:08:55,244
You can touch their hands
during that cup game...

173
00:08:55,244 --> 00:08:58,121
and you can even touch their bodies
when playing tag!

174
00:08:58,121 --> 00:08:59,957
Every girl has bosoms,

175
00:08:59,957 --> 00:09:02,334
buttocks, and a pair of thighs!

176
00:09:02,376 --> 00:09:04,253
They smell so good
when they brush by you!

177
00:09:04,294 --> 00:09:06,630
It's a treat even just
to look at them, isn't it?

178
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:10,968
I'm so lucky!

179
00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:13,679
Stop spouting such nonsense!

180
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:16,139
It's really discouraging
to lose to someone...

181
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:17,766
who is physically smaller than you!

182
00:09:17,766 --> 00:09:19,184
Gosh, that is so sad.

183
00:09:19,184 --> 00:09:21,395
Inosuke, you haven't spent much time
with girls, have you?

184
00:09:21,395 --> 00:09:22,479
You grew up in the mountains,

185
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:23,689
so I guess it's only natural
you haven't hit puberty yet.

186
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:25,983
Gosh, I feel so sorry for you!

187
00:09:25,983 --> 00:09:27,192
You're making me so angry.

188
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:28,527
What are you saying?

189
00:09:28,652 --> 00:09:31,071
I've trampled
female children before!

190
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:32,531
You are such a horrible person!

191
00:09:32,573 --> 00:09:33,657
That is so terrible!

192
00:09:33,657 --> 00:09:34,950
No one will love you
if you're like this!

193
00:09:35,993 --> 00:09:38,745
I can get as many women as I want!

194
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:42,875
Thank you for all your help.

195
00:09:52,551 --> 00:09:54,178
It's all fine.

196
00:09:54,428 --> 00:09:56,722
That guy is pretty impressive.

197
00:09:56,889 --> 00:09:59,558
I even almost cried out in pain.

198
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,893
I can't believe he's able to laugh.

199
00:10:02,561 --> 00:10:04,104
I will be your opponent.

200
00:10:05,189 --> 00:10:06,231
Start!

201
00:10:08,859 --> 00:10:11,904
I won't splash tea on a girl.

202
00:10:16,992 --> 00:10:19,119
Next, we'll proceed
with the full-body training.

203
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:20,120
Start!

204
00:10:21,038 --> 00:10:22,206
Watch this!

205
00:10:23,081 --> 00:10:25,584
It looks like I won,
but I've actually lost.

206
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:28,086
It's my turn!

207
00:10:28,337 --> 00:10:29,338
I splash!

208
00:10:29,338 --> 00:10:30,506
I caught you!

209
00:10:30,506 --> 00:10:31,548
That hurts!

210
00:10:32,257 --> 00:10:34,635
I'm the only one
who keeps losing and getting soaked.

211
00:10:35,177 --> 00:10:36,261
So embarrassing.

212
00:10:38,222 --> 00:10:39,264
But...

213
00:10:39,848 --> 00:10:41,308
none of us could beat Kanao.

214
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:45,229
No one could hold her cup down,

215
00:10:45,646 --> 00:10:47,064
nor get our hands on a cup.

216
00:10:48,273 --> 00:10:49,691
For the following
five days in a row,

217
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:52,319
I kept losing to Kanao every day.

218
00:10:53,779 --> 00:10:54,780
Inosuke...

219
00:10:55,906 --> 00:10:56,990
and even Zenitsu...

220
00:10:57,658 --> 00:11:00,994
couldn't even touch a single hair
on Kanao's head.

221
00:11:01,912 --> 00:11:04,915
Afterwards, they stopped coming
to the training room.

222
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:08,001
Zenitsu? Inosuke?

223
00:11:11,046 --> 00:11:12,214
Let's keep training!

224
00:11:16,051 --> 00:11:18,303
Thank you for your help today.

225
00:11:22,516 --> 00:11:24,476
Why can't I win against her?

226
00:11:24,893 --> 00:11:26,979
What makes us so different?

227
00:11:27,563 --> 00:11:30,315
First, our reflex speed
is completely different.

228
00:11:30,816 --> 00:11:32,401
Even if I was in my best condition,

229
00:11:32,442 --> 00:11:33,527
I would probably still lose to her.

230
00:11:34,152 --> 00:11:36,154
We're also very different
when it comes to our scents.

231
00:11:36,572 --> 00:11:37,948
The scent on her
is similar to the Hashira.

232
00:11:37,948 --> 00:11:39,032
Mr. Tanjiro.

233
00:11:39,491 --> 00:11:41,493
And her eyes...

234
00:11:41,827 --> 00:11:44,162
- I think our eyes are different...
- Mr. Tanjiro.

235
00:11:44,371 --> 00:11:45,539
Excuse me!

236
00:11:45,873 --> 00:11:48,333
Mr. Tanjiro, are you okay?

237
00:11:48,917 --> 00:11:51,086
We called you a lot of times.

238
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:52,963
Sorry, I didn't hear you.

239
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:54,214
What's the matter?

240
00:11:57,217 --> 00:11:58,343
Here's a towel for you.

241
00:11:59,761 --> 00:12:01,388
Thank you, you're a great help.

242
00:12:02,014 --> 00:12:03,307
You girls are so nice.

243
00:12:04,641 --> 00:12:05,684
By the way,

244
00:12:05,684 --> 00:12:10,564
do you use Total Concentration
Breathing the whole day?

245
00:12:12,316 --> 00:12:14,067
From morning, afternoon, till night,

246
00:12:14,193 --> 00:12:15,861
even when you're sleeping,

247
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:18,405
are you constantly in that state?

248
00:12:19,406 --> 00:12:20,490
I'm not.

249
00:12:20,741 --> 00:12:22,117
I've never done that before.

250
00:12:22,951 --> 00:12:24,745
Is that possible?

251
00:12:25,329 --> 00:12:26,371
Yes.

252
00:12:26,622 --> 00:12:28,790
If you're able to do it,

253
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:31,126
it makes a significant difference.

254
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:33,670
Using Total Concentration
Breathing for even a little bit...

255
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:35,923
makes you extremely tired.

256
00:12:36,548 --> 00:12:38,675
If one were to maintain that state
all day long...

257
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:41,803
Several people
have succeeded in doing it.

258
00:12:42,304 --> 00:12:44,681
All of the Hashira members
and Ms. Kanao can do it.

259
00:12:45,224 --> 00:12:46,683
- Try your best to do it!
- Try your best to do it!

260
00:12:47,142 --> 00:12:48,227
Is that so?

261
00:12:48,977 --> 00:12:50,062
Thank you.

262
00:12:50,062 --> 00:12:51,146
I will try it.

263
00:13:01,865 --> 00:13:04,785
It's time for training, Inosuke.

264
00:13:06,703 --> 00:13:09,248
Sulking and pouting
won't accomplish anything.

265
00:13:10,082 --> 00:13:11,542
Zenitsu, you should also come
for training.

266
00:13:13,961 --> 00:13:15,379
I think I've already done
well enough.

267
00:13:15,754 --> 00:13:17,756
Just tell them my injuries
have suddenly worsened.

268
00:13:17,881 --> 00:13:19,758
Hey, the girl from the Kakushi
over there!

269
00:13:19,883 --> 00:13:21,760
Do you want to have tea with me?

270
00:13:29,226 --> 00:13:31,019
Total Concentration Breathing.

271
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:33,355
Though I said I would try...

272
00:13:33,564 --> 00:13:36,817
using the technique all day long
even while sleeping,

273
00:13:39,736 --> 00:13:41,488
I can't do it at all.

274
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:43,073
I can't do it!

275
00:13:43,282 --> 00:13:45,951
Using Total Concentration Breathing
for a prolonged time...

276
00:13:46,118 --> 00:13:47,828
is seriously killing me!

277
00:13:48,078 --> 00:13:49,454
It's unbearable!

278
00:13:49,663 --> 00:13:51,582
My lungs hurt. My ears hurt.

279
00:13:51,623 --> 00:13:53,625
My ears are even ringing.

280
00:13:53,876 --> 00:13:55,043
My eardrums!

281
00:13:58,755 --> 00:14:00,757
That scared me!

282
00:14:00,841 --> 00:14:05,053
I thought my heart was going to pop
out of my ears just now!

283
00:14:05,262 --> 00:14:07,806
If this keeps up,
I'll never be able to do it!

284
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:10,350
When you run into trouble,
you have to go back to the basics!

285
00:14:11,185 --> 00:14:12,728
I'm such a loser!

286
00:14:18,692 --> 00:14:20,152
I have to breathe through my lungs.

287
00:14:20,944 --> 00:14:22,571
If I can't even do that,

288
00:14:22,654 --> 00:14:24,156
that means my lungs are too weak.

289
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:25,741
I can do this!

290
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,076
I just have to work hard!

291
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:29,703
That's what I've always done.

292
00:14:30,704 --> 00:14:32,789
Hard work accumulates every day.

293
00:14:33,415 --> 00:14:34,708
Even if it's just
a tiny bit of progress,

294
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:36,210
I'll continue striving forward!

295
00:14:36,752 --> 00:14:37,753
I can do it!

296
00:14:38,587 --> 00:14:41,632
Mr. Tanjiro is working really hard
every day.

297
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:44,593
Yes. Let's bring him
some rice balls to eat.

298
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:47,054
That's a good idea and...

299
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:49,723
Blow into gourd flasks?

300
00:14:50,516 --> 00:14:51,558
That's right.

301
00:14:51,558 --> 00:14:54,019
When Lady Shinobu trained Ms. Kanao,

302
00:14:54,061 --> 00:14:57,272
she often made her
blow into gourd flasks.

303
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:01,818
That's an interesting way
of training.

304
00:15:02,152 --> 00:15:04,029
Do gourd flasks make noise?

305
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:05,447
No.

306
00:15:05,614 --> 00:15:08,700
You have to blow into it
until the flask breaks.

307
00:15:10,827 --> 00:15:11,995
Blow it until it breaks?

308
00:15:13,247 --> 00:15:14,873
I have to break this
by blowing into it?

309
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:17,876
This hard and stiff thing?

310
00:15:18,001 --> 00:15:19,002
Yes.

311
00:15:19,169 --> 00:15:21,797
Also, this gourd flask
is very special.

312
00:15:21,964 --> 00:15:24,466
It is even sturdier
than most gourd flasks.

313
00:15:25,008 --> 00:15:26,718
A petite girl like her
was able to break...

314
00:15:26,718 --> 00:15:28,554
such a hard gourd flask
just by blowing into it?

315
00:15:28,846 --> 00:15:32,307
I think the size of it
gradually increases too.

316
00:15:32,808 --> 00:15:36,186
The type of gourd
that Ms. Kanao can break now...

317
00:15:37,688 --> 00:15:39,022
is like this one here.

318
00:15:39,189 --> 00:15:40,732
It's enormous!

319
00:15:40,858 --> 00:15:41,859
I need to work hard!

320
00:15:42,526 --> 00:15:43,527
(The next day)

321
00:15:43,527 --> 00:15:44,903
Are they taking a rest today too?

322
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,530
Sorry.

323
00:15:46,738 --> 00:15:48,323
I'll be sure to bring them tomorrow.

324
00:15:48,699 --> 00:15:49,783
I'm sorry.

325
00:15:50,367 --> 00:15:53,662
It's okay.
Don't bother with those two anymore.

326
00:15:54,413 --> 00:15:55,539
I'll do my best!

327
00:15:56,373 --> 00:15:57,583
I can do it!

328
00:15:59,418 --> 00:16:02,546
While doing the training practices
that Master Urokodaki had taught me,

329
00:16:03,005 --> 00:16:05,174
I also maintained a constant state
of Total Concentration Breathing.

330
00:16:05,799 --> 00:16:07,634
I imagined I was descending
the mountain...

331
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:09,845
as I ran back-and-forth
in the yard of the Butterfly Estate.

332
00:16:09,928 --> 00:16:14,057
I treated all the obstacles
like trees on the mountain.

333
00:16:14,183 --> 00:16:15,309
Work hard!

334
00:16:16,894 --> 00:16:19,104
Work hard!

335
00:16:19,521 --> 00:16:21,440
Work hard!

336
00:16:22,191 --> 00:16:23,192
(Fifteen days later)

337
00:16:23,192 --> 00:16:24,860
I recovered quite a bit
of my physical strength.

338
00:16:25,736 --> 00:16:28,197
I could run a lot further
than before...

339
00:16:28,405 --> 00:16:30,073
and my lung capacity also increased.

340
00:16:30,657 --> 00:16:31,867
This feels great.

341
00:16:32,576 --> 00:16:34,161
Running around in the day...

342
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:36,788
exercises my lungs
due to all the quick movements,

343
00:16:37,456 --> 00:16:38,707
so now, I must slowly...

344
00:16:39,374 --> 00:16:41,210
take deep breaths...

345
00:16:41,793 --> 00:16:43,962
and allow the oxygen
to reach my fingertips.

346
00:16:44,963 --> 00:16:47,216
Meditation can
enhance concentration.

347
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:49,760
That's also what
Master Urokodaki said.

348
00:16:51,512 --> 00:16:52,638
Master Urokodaki.

349
00:16:53,472 --> 00:16:57,226
How dare you break the sword I made?

350
00:16:57,726 --> 00:16:59,102
I'm sorry.

351
00:16:59,978 --> 00:17:02,481
I've already asked Mr. Haganezuka
to forge a new one for me,

352
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:04,983
but I'm really sorry.

353
00:17:06,818 --> 00:17:08,820
Focus! Concentrate!

354
00:17:09,154 --> 00:17:10,614
Concentrate on breathing!

355
00:17:11,281 --> 00:17:12,407
Hello!

356
00:17:12,574 --> 00:17:13,867
Is anyone there?

357
00:17:14,326 --> 00:17:15,494
Hello?

358
00:17:15,786 --> 00:17:16,828
Anyone?

359
00:17:17,287 --> 00:17:18,330
Yes.

360
00:17:18,372 --> 00:17:19,665
You're sure working hard.

361
00:17:22,292 --> 00:17:25,420
Your two friends are nowhere around.

362
00:17:27,965 --> 00:17:29,925
Aren't you lonely?

363
00:17:30,592 --> 00:17:31,635
No.

364
00:17:31,635 --> 00:17:32,928
If I can master it,

365
00:17:32,928 --> 00:17:34,930
I can teach them how to do it.

366
00:17:36,181 --> 00:17:38,392
You have a very pure heart.

367
00:17:42,771 --> 00:17:43,772
If I may ask,

368
00:17:44,106 --> 00:17:47,150
why did you bring us here?

369
00:17:48,402 --> 00:17:51,822
It's because Nezuko's existence
has been accepted now...

370
00:17:52,447 --> 00:17:55,284
and your wounds were too severe.

371
00:17:57,369 --> 00:17:58,453
Also,

372
00:17:59,037 --> 00:18:02,958
I want to entrust my dream to you.

373
00:18:03,876 --> 00:18:04,918
Your dream?

374
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:06,253
Yes.

375
00:18:07,171 --> 00:18:09,256
I believe
you can fulfill my dream...

376
00:18:09,923 --> 00:18:11,925
of humans and demons
living together peacefully.

377
00:18:19,683 --> 00:18:20,893
Are you angry?

378
00:18:22,436 --> 00:18:25,189
I keep sensing a scent of anger
coming from you...

379
00:18:26,064 --> 00:18:27,482
even though there's always
a smile on your face.

380
00:18:31,612 --> 00:18:32,613
Is that so?

381
00:18:33,447 --> 00:18:34,698
You're right.

382
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:38,035
Perhaps I really have
always been angry.

383
00:18:39,328 --> 00:18:42,456
Ever since my beloved older sister
was killed by a demon,

384
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:46,043
every time I see people cry...

385
00:18:46,084 --> 00:18:48,128
because their loved ones
were killed by demons,

386
00:18:49,838 --> 00:18:52,299
every time I hear a cry of despair,

387
00:18:53,217 --> 00:18:56,386
anger builds up in my heart...

388
00:18:56,803 --> 00:18:58,096
and continuously grows.

389
00:18:58,972 --> 00:19:01,099
Deep down in my body somewhere...

390
00:19:01,517 --> 00:19:03,644
lives a hatred I can't let go of.

391
00:19:04,978 --> 00:19:07,898
The other Hashira members
probably feel something similar.

392
00:19:09,733 --> 00:19:10,901
But this time,

393
00:19:11,485 --> 00:19:15,113
they personally witnessed a demon
like Nezuko who doesn't eat humans.

394
00:19:15,572 --> 00:19:17,282
They probably remember
her energy now.

395
00:19:18,242 --> 00:19:19,993
Also, with Lord Oyakata's orders,

396
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:23,413
I don't think
they'll touch Nezuko again.

397
00:19:28,836 --> 00:19:32,005
My sister was also
a kind and gentle person like you.

398
00:19:33,382 --> 00:19:35,050
She felt sympathy for demons.

399
00:19:36,093 --> 00:19:39,513
Even when she was on the verge
of death, she still pitied them.

400
00:19:40,848 --> 00:19:43,392
But I've never once
thought that way.

401
00:19:44,101 --> 00:19:46,478
How can you pity a murderer?

402
00:19:47,104 --> 00:19:49,189
There's nothing
more foolish than that.

403
00:19:50,607 --> 00:19:51,608
But...

404
00:19:51,859 --> 00:19:53,986
because that was what
my sister believed,

405
00:19:54,319 --> 00:19:55,904
I must uphold it.

406
00:19:56,864 --> 00:19:58,991
If there is a way
to resolve things...

407
00:19:58,991 --> 00:20:00,158
without having to kill
pitiful demons,

408
00:20:00,576 --> 00:20:02,286
I must continue
to figure out what that is.

409
00:20:03,328 --> 00:20:06,874
I have to keep the smile
that my sister loved on my face.

410
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,001
Kanae!

411
00:20:10,878 --> 00:20:12,129
Kanae!

412
00:20:13,088 --> 00:20:14,506
Kanae!

413
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:19,845
But I'm a little tired now.

414
00:20:21,847 --> 00:20:23,682
Demons are full of lies.

415
00:20:24,683 --> 00:20:26,393
To protect themselves,

416
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:27,895
they'll abandon their rationality...

417
00:20:28,478 --> 00:20:30,898
and kill solely
with their basic instincts.

418
00:20:34,776 --> 00:20:36,028
Tanjiro.

419
00:20:36,445 --> 00:20:37,905
Please do your best.

420
00:20:38,822 --> 00:20:40,949
You must do everything
to protect Nezuko.

421
00:20:42,784 --> 00:20:45,996
When I think of the fact that
you're working hard in my place,

422
00:20:46,663 --> 00:20:48,457
my mind is at ease.

423
00:20:49,208 --> 00:20:50,709
I also feel more relaxed.

424
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,382
Your Total Concentration
Breathing stopped.

425
00:21:05,224 --> 00:21:06,350
I'll do my best!

426
00:21:07,434 --> 00:21:09,186
Total Concentration Breathing!

427
00:21:13,982 --> 00:21:14,983
Mom.

428
00:21:14,983 --> 00:21:15,984
Hanako.

429
00:21:16,318 --> 00:21:17,986
Takeo. Shigeru.

430
00:21:18,362 --> 00:21:19,363
Rokuta.

431
00:21:22,115 --> 00:21:23,116
I...

432
00:21:23,534 --> 00:21:25,953
I'll definitely turn Nezuko
back into a human.

433
00:22:59,922 --> 00:23:00,923
(Demon Slayer)

434
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:04,718
Ms. Shinobu,
did something good happen?

435
00:23:04,801 --> 00:23:07,679
Yes, I got my hands
on some very valuable medicine.

436
00:23:08,305 --> 00:23:09,348
Are you angry?

437
00:23:09,389 --> 00:23:12,351
It's because someone secretly ate
the snacks I put in the cupboard!

438
00:23:12,935 --> 00:23:14,144
You must be really sad, aren't you?

439
00:23:14,144 --> 00:23:16,271
It's a mess on the mountain now.

440
00:23:16,647 --> 00:23:19,024
Now, let me tell you
a Taisho secret!

441
00:23:19,024 --> 00:23:21,485
Ms. Aoi is currently learning
from Ms. Shinobu,

442
00:23:21,485 --> 00:23:24,279
so I hear she also knows
how to make simple medicine.

443
00:23:24,279 --> 00:23:26,865
Your nose
can really sense everything.

444
00:23:26,949 --> 00:23:27,991
That's amazing.

445
00:23:28,158 --> 00:23:29,159
I feel like...

446
00:23:29,159 --> 00:23:31,787
I really enjoy
talking to you, Tanjiro.

447
00:23:32,204 --> 00:23:33,580
Thank you.

448
00:23:33,956 --> 00:23:37,334
Next, Episode 25,
"Tsuguko, Tsuyuri Kanao".

449
00:23:37,584 --> 00:23:39,878
(To be continued)
