1
00:00:09,259 --> 00:00:12,387
Do you know any of these people?

2
00:00:13,639 --> 00:00:16,642
It doesn't seem to be
any survivors nearby.

3
00:00:18,352 --> 00:00:19,478
According to the report,

4
00:00:19,728 --> 00:00:22,231
a few new Mizunoto members...

5
00:00:22,397 --> 00:00:24,816
went into the mountain.

6
00:00:26,151 --> 00:00:28,237
Maybe they're already dead.

7
00:00:29,821 --> 00:00:30,822
Let's go.

8
00:00:33,075 --> 00:00:35,077
The moon is so beautiful.

9
00:00:37,162 --> 00:00:39,456
It's rare for us
to go on a mission together.

10
00:00:39,665 --> 00:00:41,291
Let's get along with each other.

11
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:44,586
I'm only here to slay demons.

12
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:46,880
You're so cold.

13
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:51,093
Then let's go
our separate ways here.

14
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:53,512
I'll start looking
from the west side.

15
00:00:54,263 --> 00:00:55,264
Understood.

16
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:09,695
Don't come near my family!

17
00:01:13,615 --> 00:01:15,033
Water Breathing.

18
00:01:15,158 --> 00:01:16,159
Second Form.

19
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:18,036
Water Wheel!

20
00:01:40,142 --> 00:01:44,646
(Demon Slayer)

21
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:03,976
(Episode 18: A Forged Bond)

22
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:09,606
This is bad.

23
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:11,400
My sword can't slice through him.

24
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:23,203
It's too hard!

25
00:03:29,668 --> 00:03:31,461
I can't slash him
even with Water Breathing.

26
00:03:31,837 --> 00:03:33,839
What should I do?

27
00:03:36,091 --> 00:03:38,594
Don't come near...

28
00:03:39,011 --> 00:03:42,472
my family!

29
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:48,103
Where are you looking?

30
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:49,479
I'm right here!

31
00:03:49,855 --> 00:03:51,899
Watch me destroy you!

32
00:03:58,405 --> 00:03:59,990
That hurts.

33
00:04:00,282 --> 00:04:01,783
All he did was fling me aside,

34
00:04:01,825 --> 00:04:03,118
but the impact was so strong.

35
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:04,494
This isn't good.

36
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:06,705
I can't unleash my power
to its fullest now.

37
00:04:06,997 --> 00:04:09,458
Plus, I've bled too much,
so I feel faint.

38
00:04:13,754 --> 00:04:14,755
Darn it!

39
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:18,550
Water Breathing.

40
00:04:19,051 --> 00:04:20,969
Second Form Modified.

41
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:23,597
Lateral Water Wheel!

42
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:45,661
What is this?

43
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:47,746
What happened?

44
00:04:47,746 --> 00:04:49,665
Inosuke, are you okay?

45
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:54,545
Did he do that?

46
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:57,130
Crap, he's pretty good.

47
00:05:04,388 --> 00:05:05,472
All right!

48
00:05:05,556 --> 00:05:07,891
Now, I should be able to chop off
any neck, no matter how stiff it is.

49
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,685
Water Breathing.

50
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:12,563
The last and the strongest form
of them all.

51
00:05:17,776 --> 00:05:19,194
His breath has changed.

52
00:05:20,112 --> 00:05:23,699
It seems like he's about to do
something big.

53
00:05:26,118 --> 00:05:27,661
I'm going to use this move
and put an end to him!

54
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:31,957
Total Concentration Breathing.

55
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:33,458
Water Breathing!

56
00:05:34,168 --> 00:05:35,627
Tenth Form!

57
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:38,755
Darn it!

58
00:05:44,219 --> 00:05:45,387
Watch out!

59
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:49,641
Kentaro!

60
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:51,643
Inosuke!

61
00:05:51,977 --> 00:05:54,771
You can't die before I come back!

62
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:57,065
He's one of the Twelve Demon Moons!

63
00:05:57,191 --> 00:05:58,233
You can't die!

64
00:05:58,650 --> 00:05:59,651
Don't die!

65
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:02,654
You must not die!

66
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:15,959
This is bad!

67
00:06:29,515 --> 00:06:34,019
I can't breathe properly.

68
00:06:35,145 --> 00:06:39,733
I can't feel...

69
00:06:40,484 --> 00:06:42,861
my hands and feet either.

70
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:57,876
Nezuko.

71
00:06:59,002 --> 00:07:00,128
I'm sorry.

72
00:07:07,636 --> 00:07:09,012
You can't give up.

73
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:12,140
You can't give up!

74
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,143
You can't give up!

75
00:07:16,645 --> 00:07:17,938
I can't...

76
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:20,524
give up.

77
00:07:44,173 --> 00:07:46,341
Who are you?

78
00:07:50,721 --> 00:07:51,889
Can you hear me?

79
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,016
Are you all right?

80
00:08:00,397 --> 00:08:01,940
Water Breathing.

81
00:08:02,107 --> 00:08:03,400
Second Form!

82
00:08:05,027 --> 00:08:06,653
Water Wheel!

83
00:08:14,036 --> 00:08:15,954
Thank goodness
I made a safe landing.

84
00:08:19,374 --> 00:08:21,293
Please don't do this.

85
00:08:51,365 --> 00:08:52,699
What are you looking at?

86
00:08:53,575 --> 00:08:55,452
There's nothing to see here.

87
00:08:57,579 --> 00:08:59,498
What are you doing?

88
00:09:00,374 --> 00:09:03,168
Aren't you comrades?

89
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:05,128
"Comrades"?

90
00:09:05,712 --> 00:09:08,799
Don't confuse our relationship
with something that trivial.

91
00:09:09,466 --> 00:09:11,134
We're a family.

92
00:09:11,802 --> 00:09:13,971
There's a strong bond
connecting us together.

93
00:09:15,222 --> 00:09:16,723
Plus,

94
00:09:17,516 --> 00:09:19,810
this is between me and my sister.

95
00:09:20,686 --> 00:09:22,688
If you keep interfering,

96
00:09:23,564 --> 00:09:24,773
I'm going to chop you into pieces.

97
00:09:27,401 --> 00:09:28,402
No.

98
00:09:28,861 --> 00:09:30,362
Whether you're family or comrades,

99
00:09:30,821 --> 00:09:32,656
if there's a strong bond
between you,

100
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:34,741
that makes you equally valuable.

101
00:09:35,534 --> 00:09:37,911
Saying it's trivial just because
you're not related by blood...

102
00:09:38,704 --> 00:09:39,830
is not true at all!

103
00:09:40,789 --> 00:09:41,790
Also,

104
00:09:41,999 --> 00:09:44,168
if you're tied by a strong bond,

105
00:09:44,418 --> 00:09:45,669
then there would be
a scent of trust on you.

106
00:09:46,336 --> 00:09:47,838
But all I can smell...

107
00:09:48,422 --> 00:09:51,175
is the scent of terror,
hatred, and disgust.

108
00:09:51,967 --> 00:09:54,428
That's not what you call
a bond at all!

109
00:09:54,511 --> 00:09:55,596
It's all fake.

110
00:09:56,013 --> 00:09:57,139
It's a forged bond!

111
00:10:03,228 --> 00:10:04,354
You...

112
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:10,569
(Slayer)

113
00:10:10,694 --> 00:10:13,238
I see there's a pretty good demon
to take down here.

114
00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:17,326
Even I can take care of
a little demon like that.

115
00:10:18,827 --> 00:10:21,455
- Wait!
- Get out of the way!

116
00:10:21,872 --> 00:10:24,374
I want to climb up the ranks safely.

117
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,087
If I climb up the ranks,
the leaders will increase my pay.

118
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:32,883
Most of the members on my team
have died.

119
00:10:33,091 --> 00:10:34,092
Anyhow,

120
00:10:34,301 --> 00:10:37,971
I need to defeat a decent demon
before I leave the mountain.

121
00:10:38,722 --> 00:10:39,765
Come on!

122
00:10:39,765 --> 00:10:41,433
No! Stop!

123
00:10:47,898 --> 00:10:49,983
He just sliced him to pieces
in an instant.

124
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,527
What is this?

125
00:10:52,945 --> 00:10:55,405
Hey, what did you say?

126
00:11:00,244 --> 00:11:01,245
You...

127
00:11:02,454 --> 00:11:05,165
What did you say just now?

128
00:11:08,293 --> 00:11:09,753
Such fierce aggression.

129
00:11:10,796 --> 00:11:12,172
The air has gotten...

130
00:11:12,965 --> 00:11:14,091
so heavy and dense.

131
00:11:16,593 --> 00:11:18,804
Inosuke, I'm sorry.

132
00:11:19,638 --> 00:11:20,764
Do your best...

133
00:11:21,306 --> 00:11:22,307
and hang in there.

134
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:25,644
I'll go find you
after I beat this demon.

135
00:11:27,229 --> 00:11:30,023
I'll definitely go and save you!

136
00:11:31,108 --> 00:11:33,527
Repeat what you said just now...

137
00:11:34,862 --> 00:11:36,488
one more time.

138
00:11:39,908 --> 00:11:41,118
Hurry and say it.

139
00:11:41,785 --> 00:11:44,329
I'll say it
as many times as you want!

140
00:11:44,955 --> 00:11:47,082
The bond you were talking about
is forged!

141
00:12:13,817 --> 00:12:15,277
Things aren't looking good.

142
00:12:16,153 --> 00:12:24,077
(Demon Slayer)

143
00:12:30,334 --> 00:12:31,376
Darn it.

144
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:33,962
I can't believe I'm hiding
in a place like this.

145
00:12:33,962 --> 00:12:35,589
I'm such a coward.

146
00:12:36,256 --> 00:12:38,467
But I have to think carefully.

147
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:42,387
What method can I use
to slash this impenetrable creature?

148
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:44,348
What can I do?

149
00:12:44,473 --> 00:12:45,933
What should I do?

150
00:12:46,225 --> 00:12:48,727
What can I do to slash him to death?

151
00:12:49,186 --> 00:12:52,731
Think quickly!

152
00:12:57,444 --> 00:12:59,863
Crap. This is really bad!

153
00:13:00,614 --> 00:13:01,823
Before that brat...

154
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:03,867
Before that brat comes back,

155
00:13:03,992 --> 00:13:05,452
I have to think of something.

156
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:10,707
What are these stupid thoughts
I'm having?

157
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:15,504
Are you kidding me?

158
00:13:21,969 --> 00:13:23,971
You foul creature!

159
00:13:24,847 --> 00:13:29,101
I've been contaminated
by Tontaro's germs!

160
00:13:29,101 --> 00:13:31,103
I can't believe
I'm thinking the same way he does!

161
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:33,188
It was so close!

162
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:36,692
It wouldn't be the real me
if I used my brain to think!

163
00:13:42,322 --> 00:13:43,532
Do you see that?

164
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:44,908
I've chopped it off!

165
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,037
It's that simple.

166
00:13:49,371 --> 00:13:51,164
If one sword
can't slice through you,

167
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:54,668
I just have to hammer down
the blade and keep chopping...

168
00:13:54,918 --> 00:13:56,086
because...

169
00:13:56,503 --> 00:13:58,797
I have two swords!

170
00:14:01,425 --> 00:14:03,510
I am the strongest!

171
00:14:08,891 --> 00:14:10,767
Why are you running away?

172
00:14:11,059 --> 00:14:13,854
Stand right there!

173
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:28,869
Let me make myself clear.

174
00:14:29,161 --> 00:14:31,914
I won't kill you in one go.

175
00:14:32,706 --> 00:14:36,084
I'm going to slice you into pieces
and then mince you to little bits.

176
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:41,173
But...

177
00:14:41,798 --> 00:14:44,051
If you take back what you just said,

178
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:46,553
I can be generous
and kill you instantly.

179
00:14:47,137 --> 00:14:48,305
I won't take it back.

180
00:14:48,805 --> 00:14:50,849
Everything I said is true.

181
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,851
You're the one...

182
00:14:53,268 --> 00:14:54,353
with a problem!

183
00:15:01,527 --> 00:15:03,946
You're the one who's wrong!

184
00:15:20,838 --> 00:15:21,922
Darn it.

185
00:15:21,922 --> 00:15:24,633
Where did he go?

186
00:15:24,633 --> 00:15:25,759
Darn it.

187
00:15:29,179 --> 00:15:32,182
Measly wounds like this don't hurt.

188
00:15:32,558 --> 00:15:35,769
I'm in no pain, so it doesn't hurt.

189
00:15:36,019 --> 00:15:37,145
At this stage now,

190
00:15:37,646 --> 00:15:39,648
I have to find that guy.

191
00:15:52,077 --> 00:15:53,453
So you're here!

192
00:15:53,912 --> 00:15:57,332
Why did that scum climb up so high?

193
00:15:58,542 --> 00:16:00,002
You piece of trash...

194
00:16:00,043 --> 00:16:03,338
You've come up with some evil plan
to make me use my brain again.

195
00:16:03,964 --> 00:16:05,424
I won't fall for it.

196
00:16:09,386 --> 00:16:10,470
What?

197
00:16:11,305 --> 00:16:12,723
I see.

198
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:16,310
You're so terrified of me
that you're shaking.

199
00:16:18,604 --> 00:16:20,355
It's already too late to be scared!

200
00:16:25,903 --> 00:16:26,987
What?

201
00:16:27,196 --> 00:16:28,197
This time...

202
00:16:33,202 --> 00:16:35,704
Did he just shed his skin?

203
00:16:46,715 --> 00:16:47,799
Is this for real?

204
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:51,553
Gosh, you've gotten way too big.

205
00:16:52,179 --> 00:16:53,805
I'm in trouble now.

206
00:16:54,348 --> 00:16:55,974
I've never felt
such an overwhelming force...

207
00:16:55,974 --> 00:16:58,143
from any of my enemies before.

208
00:16:58,977 --> 00:17:01,230
Even this force alone
is crushing me down.

209
00:17:06,568 --> 00:17:07,653
I'm doomed.

210
00:17:08,237 --> 00:17:09,279
I can't beat him.

211
00:17:17,246 --> 00:17:18,455
I'm going to die.

212
00:17:20,499 --> 00:17:21,708
He's going to kill me.

213
00:17:23,043 --> 00:17:24,044
You can't die!

214
00:17:25,587 --> 00:17:28,382
You can't die before I come back!

215
00:17:29,466 --> 00:17:34,513
Always stay proud of yourselves
and live life to the fullest.

216
00:17:35,389 --> 00:17:37,266
I wish you all the best of luck
in your battle.

217
00:17:40,227 --> 00:17:41,353
I won't admit defeat.

218
00:17:42,688 --> 00:17:44,606
I am not giving in!

219
00:17:45,566 --> 00:17:49,236
I am Hashibira Inosuke
of the Demon Slayer Corps!

220
00:17:49,403 --> 00:17:52,155
Bring it on, you loser!

221
00:17:53,949 --> 00:17:54,950
He's too quick.

222
00:17:55,158 --> 00:17:56,243
I can't see him at all.

223
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:04,751
Beast Breathing.

224
00:18:05,711 --> 00:18:07,045
Third Fang.

225
00:18:07,462 --> 00:18:09,339
Devour!

226
00:18:11,049 --> 00:18:12,134
What?

227
00:18:17,306 --> 00:18:18,724
My sword broke.

228
00:18:18,891 --> 00:18:19,975
Darn it!

229
00:18:19,975 --> 00:18:21,059
Because of the breathing style,

230
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:22,060
I couldn't adjust in time
to absorb the impact.

231
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:27,608
Stay away from my family.

232
00:18:28,233 --> 00:18:30,360
I won't die!

233
00:18:30,944 --> 00:18:32,613
Beast Breathing.

234
00:18:32,613 --> 00:18:33,906
First Fang.

235
00:18:34,865 --> 00:18:36,116
Take this.

236
00:18:36,116 --> 00:18:37,743
Pierce!

237
00:18:39,953 --> 00:18:41,288
It pierced through him.

238
00:18:41,622 --> 00:18:43,207
Though it pierced through him,

239
00:18:43,624 --> 00:18:47,294
why doesn't he feel anything at all?

240
00:19:07,814 --> 00:19:08,941
I'm sorry.

241
00:19:11,777 --> 00:19:14,238
I'm sorry, Inosuke.

242
00:19:26,917 --> 00:19:28,877
You have to keep on living.

243
00:19:29,878 --> 00:19:31,004
Inosuke.

244
00:19:39,137 --> 00:19:41,014
Who is that?

245
00:19:52,025 --> 00:19:53,193
What happened?

246
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:57,948
Did that guy slash him?

247
00:19:59,199 --> 00:20:02,828
Who in the world is he?

248
00:20:14,339 --> 00:20:15,382
He's so quick!

249
00:20:17,217 --> 00:20:18,427
Water Breathing.

250
00:20:18,802 --> 00:20:19,887
Fourth Form.

251
00:20:20,304 --> 00:20:21,471
Striking Tide!

252
00:20:29,855 --> 00:20:32,191
Amazing.

253
00:20:37,404 --> 00:20:40,073
This is the first time I've seen...

254
00:20:40,991 --> 00:20:43,327
someone so remarkable.

255
00:20:51,793 --> 00:20:52,836
I can sense...

256
00:20:53,253 --> 00:20:55,088
the pungent smell fading.

257
00:20:55,881 --> 00:20:57,633
I can also differentiate
the scent of the threads now.

258
00:20:58,550 --> 00:21:00,219
Now, I can battle him.

259
00:21:02,638 --> 00:21:05,098
This guy is smarter than I thought.

260
00:21:05,849 --> 00:21:07,726
He doesn't conform
to his fear at all.

261
00:21:08,519 --> 00:21:09,561
But...

262
00:21:09,978 --> 00:21:11,396
this has nothing to do
with wits anyway.

263
00:21:18,946 --> 00:21:20,447
Water Breathing!

264
00:21:20,906 --> 00:21:22,282
First Form!

265
00:21:22,699 --> 00:21:24,993
Water Surface Slash!

266
00:23:00,047 --> 00:23:01,089
(Demon Slayer)

267
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:03,091
How amazing!

268
00:23:03,258 --> 00:23:04,468
So strong and mighty.

269
00:23:04,468 --> 00:23:06,178
You defeated that demon
in the blink of an eye.

270
00:23:06,178 --> 00:23:07,429
Who exactly are you?

271
00:23:08,305 --> 00:23:09,973
You used the same move as Monjiro.

272
00:23:09,973 --> 00:23:11,225
Are you guys teammates?

273
00:23:11,975 --> 00:23:13,477
Do you not notice I'm right here?

274
00:23:13,477 --> 00:23:14,561
Look this way.

275
00:23:14,895 --> 00:23:17,064
Look at me!

276
00:23:17,064 --> 00:23:18,232
Do you know this move?

277
00:23:19,066 --> 00:23:20,067
Hey!

278
00:23:22,903 --> 00:23:25,113
Now, let me tell you
a Taisho secret.

279
00:23:25,113 --> 00:23:27,491
I heard Tanjiro likes eating
plum seaweed rice balls...

280
00:23:27,658 --> 00:23:30,285
and Zenitsu likes salmon rice balls.

281
00:23:31,787 --> 00:23:34,414
Next up, Episode 19, "Hinokami".

282
00:23:34,831 --> 00:23:36,458
So, you do know how to talk!

283
00:23:36,875 --> 00:23:39,837
(To be continued)
