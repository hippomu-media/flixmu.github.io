1
00:00:03,253 --> 00:00:04,922
Beast Breathing.

2
00:00:05,047 --> 00:00:06,298
Seventh Fang.

3
00:00:06,673 --> 00:00:08,759
Spatial Awareness.

4
00:00:26,068 --> 00:00:27,069
Did you find it?

5
00:00:27,402 --> 00:00:28,946
Yes, it's over there.

6
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,448
I can feel that she's very strong.

7
00:00:31,907 --> 00:00:32,991
I see.

8
00:00:32,991 --> 00:00:34,409
You're incredible, Inosuke.

9
00:00:38,205 --> 00:00:39,206
Darn it.

10
00:00:39,373 --> 00:00:42,000
We must deal with these guys first
or we can't go forward.

11
00:00:47,256 --> 00:00:48,340
Darn it.

12
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:51,635
Is there no other way?

13
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:09,778
(Demon Slayer)

14
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:28,982
(Episode 16:
Letting Someone Else Go First)

15
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:46,250
Nezuko...

16
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,669
Where...

17
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:52,214
Where are you?

18
00:03:00,931 --> 00:03:01,932
Darn it.

19
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:03,517
This is so annoying.

20
00:03:03,517 --> 00:03:05,352
I want to defeat these guys
in one blow.

21
00:03:05,352 --> 00:03:06,812
You can't do that.

22
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,814
There must be a way,

23
00:03:09,106 --> 00:03:11,942
so we can't hurt them.

24
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,115
Mr. Murata.

25
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:21,118
I'll take care of them. Go.

26
00:03:21,827 --> 00:03:24,037
Why is someone who wet their pants
talking big?

27
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:26,957
Who wet their pants?
You stupid boar!

28
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:29,209
I wasn't talking to you.

29
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:30,377
Shut up!

30
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:35,757
Even if you saw my weak side,

31
00:03:35,883 --> 00:03:38,051
I'm still a member
of the Demon Slayer Corps.

32
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:39,845
I'll think of a way
to hold them off here.

33
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:42,931
I know that I just have to
cut off the threads.

34
00:03:43,307 --> 00:03:45,267
Those who are being
controlled here...

35
00:03:45,309 --> 00:03:46,643
have very monotonous movements.

36
00:03:46,977 --> 00:03:48,604
I'll also watch out for the spider.

37
00:03:49,188 --> 00:03:50,314
There should be
someone more powerful...

38
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:53,192
who's being controlled
around the demon.

39
00:03:53,692 --> 00:03:54,902
Go.

40
00:03:55,152 --> 00:03:56,195
All right.

41
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,404
Thank you.

42
00:03:57,863 --> 00:03:58,989
Let's go, Inosuke.

43
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:02,576
Let go of me!

44
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:04,870
I want to punch that guy first
before I go.

45
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:06,538
Who's the stupid boar?

46
00:04:06,538 --> 00:04:07,831
You're so noisy!

47
00:04:07,873 --> 00:04:09,666
Cut it out. Let's go!

48
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,045
Wait for me to come back.
I'll surely beat you up!

49
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:18,800
Darn it.

50
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,636
I will definitely beat him up.

51
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:22,429
Stop saying these things.

52
00:04:22,471 --> 00:04:25,224
He called me a stupid boar, Monjiro.

53
00:04:25,224 --> 00:04:26,683
My name is Tanjiro!

54
00:04:27,226 --> 00:04:29,561
It's this direction, right?

55
00:04:29,853 --> 00:04:32,439
My sense has always been accurate.

56
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:34,107
However,

57
00:04:35,025 --> 00:04:37,778
what's going on
with these annoying threads?

58
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:41,073
Based on this, we can tell
that we're close to the demon.

59
00:04:44,743 --> 00:04:46,119
Someone else is coming.

60
00:04:49,081 --> 00:04:50,123
No.

61
00:04:52,334 --> 00:04:55,254
You can't come here.

62
00:04:56,088 --> 00:04:59,633
Get someone of a higher level.

63
00:05:00,509 --> 00:05:03,720
Otherwise, you'd all
get killed by me!

64
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:06,765
Please.

65
00:05:08,392 --> 00:05:09,434
Please!

66
00:05:15,274 --> 00:05:17,401
Do you have a way to defeat me?

67
00:05:18,402 --> 00:05:20,988
The closer you are to me,

68
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,365
the stronger the threads will be.

69
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:25,659
The puppets would
become stronger too.

70
00:05:27,786 --> 00:05:28,871
Mother.

71
00:05:33,417 --> 00:05:34,626
Can you win this?

72
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:38,505
Rui.

73
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:43,927
It seems like you're wasting
too much time.

74
00:05:51,143 --> 00:05:52,436
If you don't deal with them soon,

75
00:05:53,103 --> 00:05:55,272
I'll tell Father.

76
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:58,358
Don't worry.

77
00:05:58,358 --> 00:05:59,568
I can do it.

78
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:01,403
I'll protect you.

79
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:03,447
About your father...

80
00:06:03,572 --> 00:06:04,740
Don't tell your father about this!

81
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:05,824
Your father...

82
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:15,876
In that case, deal with them now.

83
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:34,603
Die.

84
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:36,021
Go and die.

85
00:06:36,188 --> 00:06:38,607
Otherwise, I'd get in trouble.

86
00:06:42,027 --> 00:06:43,695
Run!

87
00:06:45,489 --> 00:06:46,532
She's fast.

88
00:06:47,074 --> 00:06:48,742
Since I'm being controlled,

89
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:53,121
my movements are completely
different from usual.

90
00:06:53,372 --> 00:06:57,626
We weren't this strong.

91
00:07:07,386 --> 00:07:10,097
With a demon controlling
their bodies with threads,

92
00:07:10,305 --> 00:07:12,224
even if their bones are fractured,
they can still wield their swords.

93
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:19,815
This is unacceptable.

94
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:23,151
What a difficult guy to deal with.

95
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:25,112
In that case...

96
00:07:25,988 --> 00:07:27,030
That sound...

97
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:31,952
Hurry...

98
00:07:32,703 --> 00:07:34,079
Hurry and kill me now.

99
00:07:35,289 --> 00:07:36,373
My arms and legs are broken.

100
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:37,791
My bones...

101
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:43,338
My bones have even pierced
my internal organs.

102
00:07:44,715 --> 00:07:46,425
I really can't endure...

103
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:48,177
the intense pain...

104
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:49,887
of having my body
pulled and controlled.

105
00:07:50,846 --> 00:07:54,266
I'll die anyway.

106
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:56,935
Help me.

107
00:07:57,895 --> 00:08:01,064
Stop my suffering.

108
00:08:03,066 --> 00:08:04,526
All right!

109
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:06,236
Wait!

110
00:08:07,154 --> 00:08:08,447
Wait a moment.

111
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:10,073
There must be a way to save them!

112
00:08:10,616 --> 00:08:12,284
You talk too much!

113
00:08:12,868 --> 00:08:15,078
You talk too much!

114
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:16,705
But...

115
00:08:17,372 --> 00:08:20,209
They themselves want to die
a quick death.

116
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:25,631
They move very fast.

117
00:08:25,756 --> 00:08:28,258
We'll die too
if we keep dillydallying.

118
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:29,301
I know.

119
00:08:29,551 --> 00:08:31,136
I'm trying to think of something,
so please wait.

120
00:08:32,095 --> 00:08:33,388
I don't want to attack them,

121
00:08:33,889 --> 00:08:36,475
but even if I cut the threads,
they'd immediately get reattached.

122
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:38,810
We must make them stop moving.

123
00:08:40,437 --> 00:08:41,480
That's right.

124
00:08:43,398 --> 00:08:44,483
Hey.

125
00:08:49,404 --> 00:08:50,948
Great. She's following me.

126
00:08:51,949 --> 00:08:55,577
Why are you running in circles?

127
00:08:55,744 --> 00:08:57,204
You're still being ridiculous
at a time like this!

128
00:09:04,336 --> 00:09:05,712
Focus.

129
00:09:09,132 --> 00:09:10,551
What a strong power.

130
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:18,141
Great!

131
00:09:18,141 --> 00:09:19,393
She got entangled.

132
00:09:23,021 --> 00:09:24,022
What...

133
00:09:25,649 --> 00:09:27,568
What kind of technique is that?

134
00:09:27,568 --> 00:09:29,820
I want to try it too!

135
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:47,337
Did you see that?

136
00:09:47,379 --> 00:09:50,174
I can also do what you do.

137
00:09:50,299 --> 00:09:51,341
I'm sorry.

138
00:09:51,466 --> 00:09:52,843
I didn't see it!

139
00:09:52,843 --> 00:09:54,011
What?

140
00:09:54,261 --> 00:09:56,430
Because I was too busy!

141
00:10:03,228 --> 00:10:04,479
Darn it.

142
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:07,024
They're all useless puppets.

143
00:10:08,483 --> 00:10:10,777
Looks like I can only
use that puppet.

144
00:10:14,156 --> 00:10:21,997
(Demon Slayer)

145
00:10:23,332 --> 00:10:26,502
Nezuko!

146
00:10:30,339 --> 00:10:33,967
Nezuko, where are you?

147
00:10:36,553 --> 00:10:37,971
Nezuko.

148
00:10:38,305 --> 00:10:39,556
Tanjiro.

149
00:10:40,015 --> 00:10:41,183
Boar.

150
00:10:41,475 --> 00:10:43,101
Chuntaro.

151
00:10:43,227 --> 00:10:45,312
Where did you all go?

152
00:10:45,604 --> 00:10:48,232
It's all my fault.

153
00:10:56,323 --> 00:10:57,491
Chuntaro.

154
00:10:59,952 --> 00:11:02,371
Did you fly over
just to look for me?

155
00:11:02,371 --> 00:11:04,081
You're such a cute fellow,

156
00:11:04,122 --> 00:11:06,333
although Nezuko
is still a bit cuter!

157
00:11:09,336 --> 00:11:11,046
It's my fault!

158
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:14,049
All right. Let's go and find Nezuko.

159
00:11:19,054 --> 00:11:20,347
Look.

160
00:11:20,389 --> 00:11:21,557
Take a look.

161
00:11:21,598 --> 00:11:23,100
I tossed them higher than you.

162
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,768
Yes. There's one more.

163
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:26,311
Okay.

164
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:28,397
I'll do it one more time.
Watch carefully.

165
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:30,274
All right then.

166
00:11:30,524 --> 00:11:32,109
Don't be too rough.

167
00:11:32,526 --> 00:11:35,863
I don't need weak human puppets.

168
00:11:36,071 --> 00:11:38,532
Useless humans!

169
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:50,961
Darn it.

170
00:11:50,961 --> 00:11:52,880
Everyone still got killed.

171
00:12:15,986 --> 00:12:16,987
Let's go.

172
00:12:18,572 --> 00:12:19,823
You're right.

173
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:25,746
This way.

174
00:12:25,787 --> 00:12:27,539
We're already very close.

175
00:12:28,415 --> 00:12:29,833
The wind direction changed.

176
00:12:30,209 --> 00:12:31,835
My nose has also become sensitive.

177
00:12:32,544 --> 00:12:34,755
This way, I can find out
the location of the demon.

178
00:12:35,964 --> 00:12:38,509
There are two kinds of smells here.

179
00:12:40,552 --> 00:12:41,595
Inosuke!

180
00:12:41,637 --> 00:12:43,555
I discovered them first.

181
00:12:44,014 --> 00:12:46,141
I want to cut off that guy's head!

182
00:12:55,317 --> 00:12:56,318
This guy...

183
00:12:57,402 --> 00:12:59,279
has no head!

184
00:13:01,406 --> 00:13:03,200
Nezuko!

185
00:13:03,575 --> 00:13:05,327
Where are you?

186
00:13:13,377 --> 00:13:14,461
Where exactly did you all go?

187
00:13:14,503 --> 00:13:16,588
Tanjiro, Inosuke.

188
00:13:16,839 --> 00:13:20,092
Don't leave me all alone
in such a terrifying forest.

189
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:31,061
What the heck?

190
00:13:32,938 --> 00:13:35,732
I'm starting to get furious.

191
00:13:37,067 --> 00:13:40,904
I must find Nezuko soon
and leave this terrifying forest.

192
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:44,867
Nezuko!

193
00:13:58,005 --> 00:13:59,590
That guy doesn't have
a weak spot at all.

194
00:13:59,798 --> 00:14:01,300
In that case, we can't kill him.

195
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:03,927
Inosuke.

196
00:14:03,969 --> 00:14:05,596
What should we do?

197
00:14:05,804 --> 00:14:06,889
Calm down.

198
00:14:07,055 --> 00:14:08,265
Use Kesa Killing Method.

199
00:14:08,599 --> 00:14:10,100
From the base of the neck,

200
00:14:10,309 --> 00:14:11,935
cut him from right to left
towards the armpit.

201
00:14:13,145 --> 00:14:14,271
Cut him wide.

202
00:14:14,438 --> 00:14:16,815
And you should be firm.

203
00:14:17,983 --> 00:14:19,693
Wait, let's do it together!

204
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:21,195
He's fast.

205
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:28,160
But it's not to the point
that he can't be dodged.

206
00:14:29,536 --> 00:14:31,371
Crap. There's a spider.

207
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:35,834
I can't move.

208
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:37,836
I'm going to get killed.

209
00:14:52,518 --> 00:14:53,602
Inosuke.

210
00:14:53,685 --> 00:14:54,853
Let's battle together.

211
00:14:55,103 --> 00:14:56,355
Let's think of something together!

212
00:14:56,688 --> 00:14:58,232
In order to defeat this demon,

213
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:00,067
let's deal with him together!

214
00:15:00,984 --> 00:15:01,985
Darn it!

215
00:15:02,194 --> 00:15:05,822
Stop making me frizzy all over!

216
00:15:08,534 --> 00:15:10,244
You're in my way!

217
00:15:11,787 --> 00:15:14,122
Inosuke, step on me.

218
00:15:27,845 --> 00:15:30,639
Inosuke, jump!

219
00:15:34,476 --> 00:15:35,602
Total Concentration Breathing.

220
00:15:36,228 --> 00:15:37,437
Water Breathing.

221
00:15:38,021 --> 00:15:39,314
Fourth Form.

222
00:15:42,317 --> 00:15:43,569
Striking Tide!

223
00:15:49,491 --> 00:15:50,951
Use Kesa Killing Method.

224
00:15:51,243 --> 00:15:52,286
Darn it.

225
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:54,580
What's going on? I'm so furious.

226
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:56,915
Why is everything happening
like he said?

227
00:15:57,916 --> 00:16:00,210
It's like everything is expected.

228
00:16:01,211 --> 00:16:05,048
It's as natural
as the flowing river.

229
00:16:07,217 --> 00:16:10,637
He's not charging forward,

230
00:16:11,096 --> 00:16:15,309
but observing the process
of the fight instead.

231
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:37,539
Great. You killed him.

232
00:16:37,831 --> 00:16:38,874
Incredible.

233
00:16:38,874 --> 00:16:40,417
You defeated him, Inosuke!

234
00:16:45,797 --> 00:16:46,798
Inosuke?

235
00:16:52,262 --> 00:16:56,099
I can also do
what you can, you fool.

236
00:17:08,487 --> 00:17:09,947
This smell...

237
00:17:10,322 --> 00:17:12,407
So that's why, Inosuke.

238
00:17:14,201 --> 00:17:15,202
I'm defeated.

239
00:17:15,369 --> 00:17:16,411
I got defeated.

240
00:17:16,537 --> 00:17:19,122
That puppet was obviously
the fastest and the strongest.

241
00:17:20,457 --> 00:17:23,460
It's all because Ryu came
and threatened me.

242
00:17:23,627 --> 00:17:27,840
That's why I felt anxious,
irritated, and flustered.

243
00:17:30,801 --> 00:17:31,885
Up there.

244
00:17:33,846 --> 00:17:36,515
Water Breathing, First Form.

245
00:17:37,099 --> 00:17:38,100
I'm going to get killed.

246
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:39,268
My head is going to be chopped off.

247
00:17:39,309 --> 00:17:41,061
I must think of something.

248
00:17:46,108 --> 00:17:47,150
However...

249
00:17:48,569 --> 00:17:50,904
I can be free if I die.

250
00:17:56,118 --> 00:17:57,828
I will be released.

251
00:18:01,081 --> 00:18:02,082
Fifth Form.

252
00:18:03,709 --> 00:18:05,169
Blessed Rain After the Drought.

253
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:16,013
This is...

254
00:18:18,056 --> 00:18:21,393
It feels like gentle rain
falling on my body.

255
00:18:23,896 --> 00:18:25,606
It doesn't hurt at all.

256
00:18:26,356 --> 00:18:27,691
I don't feel any pain at all.

257
00:18:28,358 --> 00:18:29,359
It just...

258
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:31,320
feels warm.

259
00:18:34,364 --> 00:18:37,201
I didn't expect to welcome death
so peacefully.

260
00:18:41,205 --> 00:18:42,289
This way,

261
00:18:42,998 --> 00:18:44,541
I can get released.

262
00:18:56,261 --> 00:18:57,346
It's all my fault.

263
00:18:57,346 --> 00:18:58,430
I'm willing to apologize.

264
00:18:58,430 --> 00:18:59,765
Please forgive me.

265
00:19:01,099 --> 00:19:02,559
Why are you mad?

266
00:19:02,684 --> 00:19:04,561
Is there anything
that made you unhappy?

267
00:19:09,274 --> 00:19:12,778
Your mistake lies in not knowing
why he's mad.

268
00:19:14,404 --> 00:19:15,489
What?

269
00:19:15,656 --> 00:19:16,698
But I...

270
00:19:19,076 --> 00:19:22,162
Mother made Father mad again.

271
00:19:30,045 --> 00:19:33,507
No, don't!

272
00:19:48,397 --> 00:19:50,065
Those eyes.

273
00:19:52,568 --> 00:19:53,902
Those gentle eyes.

274
00:19:57,239 --> 00:19:58,657
When I was still human,

275
00:19:59,491 --> 00:20:03,704
someone looked at me
with such warm eyes too.

276
00:20:06,415 --> 00:20:09,042
Who was it?

277
00:20:14,548 --> 00:20:15,799
I can't remember.

278
00:20:17,176 --> 00:20:20,721
It was someone who has always
cared about me.

279
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:26,435
I wonder...

280
00:20:27,436 --> 00:20:28,979
what happened to him now.

281
00:20:41,116 --> 00:20:43,243
The Twelve Demon Moons are here.

282
00:20:46,121 --> 00:20:47,164
Wait.

283
00:20:49,124 --> 00:20:50,751
You must be careful.

284
00:20:59,009 --> 00:21:00,719
"The Twelve Demon Moons are here."

285
00:21:02,221 --> 00:21:03,972
The real Twelve Demon Moons...

286
00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:05,933
are in this mountain.

287
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:41,111
(Demon Slayer)

288
00:22:44,364 --> 00:22:46,950
I can also do what you can.

289
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:50,871
- But I know something you can't do.
- What did you say?

290
00:22:50,913 --> 00:22:53,832
Don't you always forget my name?

291
00:22:54,625 --> 00:22:56,418
Of course I remember your name.

292
00:22:56,585 --> 00:22:58,879
- Kamaboko Gonpachiro.
- Wrong.

293
00:22:59,630 --> 00:23:01,632
- Sakaryoku Gengoro.
- Wrong.

294
00:23:01,715 --> 00:23:03,008
Itadaki Tontaro.

295
00:23:03,008 --> 00:23:04,176
Completely wrong.

296
00:23:04,384 --> 00:23:07,262
Now, let me tell you
a Taisho secret!

297
00:23:07,262 --> 00:23:09,097
I heard that when Inosuke
calls someone's name,

298
00:23:09,097 --> 00:23:11,600
he'd get it right
once every seven times.

299
00:23:12,226 --> 00:23:13,894
You already called me
by the wrong name three times.

300
00:23:13,936 --> 00:23:15,270
Can you really get it right?

301
00:23:15,521 --> 00:23:17,022
Anago Kanjiro.

302
00:23:17,022 --> 00:23:18,023
It's a bit close.

303
00:23:18,023 --> 00:23:20,108
- Hamado Tangoro.
- What a shame. That's wrong.

304
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:21,318
Amado Chanjiro.

305
00:23:21,318 --> 00:23:23,278
- It's almost right.
- Kamado...

306
00:23:23,987 --> 00:23:26,114
I say names aren't important at all.

307
00:23:26,573 --> 00:23:28,659
I almost heard my full name.

308
00:23:28,784 --> 00:23:31,995
Next, Episode 17,
"You Must Master a Single Thing".

309
00:23:32,204 --> 00:23:34,414
You're you, and I'm me.

310
00:23:34,414 --> 00:23:35,874
All right, Tanjiro?

311
00:23:37,251 --> 00:23:39,628
(To be continued)
