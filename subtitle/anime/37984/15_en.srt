1
00:00:21,708 --> 00:00:24,958
I'm supposed to be
the person in charge of magic No. 1.

2
00:00:24,958 --> 00:00:27,583
I'm in the spiritual world of my mother now.

3
00:00:27,583 --> 00:00:29,375
What happened...

4
00:00:29,375 --> 00:00:31,917
No. 1, don't slack off. Get to work.

5
00:00:33,417 --> 00:00:35,292
Alright, I get it.

6
00:00:35,292 --> 00:00:38,250
Always nagging.

7
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:41,375
People who care about relationships are stupid.

8
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:43,375
After all, you are...

9
00:00:46,458 --> 00:00:48,250
She flew so high.

10
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:50,333
Nice shot.

11
00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:00,292
It hurts...

12
00:01:00,292 --> 00:01:03,458
-It hurts!
-Calm down, the person in charge of body.

13
00:01:03,458 --> 00:01:06,417
-Don't we have anti-Gaido skill?
-It hurts.

14
00:01:06,417 --> 00:01:10,250
-Yes. Mental direct attack will be offset.
-It hurts a lot.

15
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:11,750
-Logically, it shouldn't hurt.
-It hurts so much!

16
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:14,750
Why can't you just cooperate with me?

17
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:17,000
Because it's meaningless.

18
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,125
What's wrong with you?

19
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:29,958
Nothing. I was wondering,
why didn't mother fight back when attacked?

20
00:01:29,958 --> 00:01:33,250
Because we have the anti-Gaido skill.
Even if she wants to fight back, she can't.

21
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:35,125
It would be good if that's the case.

22
00:01:35,125 --> 00:01:38,167
Thinking too much can't
bring us a conclusion after all.

23
00:01:38,167 --> 00:01:40,542
Let's go back to the Body after eating.

24
00:01:40,542 --> 00:01:41,458
Okay.

25
00:01:41,458 --> 00:01:42,667
You're right.

26
00:01:49,042 --> 00:01:52,208
♫The alarm goes off. My name is Little Spider♫

48
00:03:21,208 --> 00:03:24,708
Is the vampire child alright?

49
00:03:24,708 --> 00:03:27,542
She seems to have been targeted.

50
00:03:27,542 --> 00:03:31,667
But it's surely simpler than being
a reincarnated spider. She should be fine.

51
00:03:31,667 --> 00:03:35,333
I have my business to attend to.
I should stop thinking about it.

52
00:03:35,333 --> 00:03:37,542
That's it.

53
00:03:37,542 --> 00:03:42,750
By the way, my parallel wills haven't
contacted me since they're with mother.

54
00:03:43,917 --> 00:03:47,542
Things are perhaps going well
when there's no news.

55
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:00,375
We finally got rid of half a leg.

56
00:04:00,375 --> 00:04:04,458
I thought we can never finish this.
It seems there may be a way.

57
00:04:04,458 --> 00:04:07,750
Over there, you're starting to slack off
as soon as I'm not watching.

58
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:08,542
Get to work!

59
00:04:08,542 --> 00:04:10,083
Roger.

60
00:04:13,875 --> 00:04:15,792
Don't you think it's weird?

61
00:04:15,792 --> 00:04:17,708
Weird? What's weird?

62
00:04:17,708 --> 00:04:22,542
Although this is very time consuming,
if this goes on mother will surely lose.

63
00:04:22,542 --> 00:04:24,292
Isn't this good?

64
00:04:24,292 --> 00:04:27,125
However, she's doing nothing.

65
00:04:27,125 --> 00:04:31,625
Mother is too big to go outside,
that's why she gave up.

66
00:04:31,625 --> 00:04:33,208
How is this possible?

67
00:04:33,208 --> 00:04:35,292
What? What's going on?

68
00:04:35,292 --> 00:04:40,208
Nothing. I think it's weird
that mother is doing nothing.

69
00:04:40,208 --> 00:04:47,125
That's right. She has so many subordinates,
why didn't she send them to attack the Body?

70
00:04:47,125 --> 00:04:49,583
Besides, there are Arch Taratects.

71
00:04:49,583 --> 00:04:51,458
If many Arch Taratects attack

72
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:55,917
at the same time, there's
a high chance for them to defeat the Body.

73
00:04:55,917 --> 00:05:00,917
But if our Body faces that situation,
she will escape using Teleport.

74
00:05:01,708 --> 00:05:02,208
Escape?

75
00:05:02,208 --> 00:05:05,167
Since there's no chance of winning,
of course she will escape.

76
00:05:05,167 --> 00:05:08,583
Does mother know this?

77
00:05:08,583 --> 00:05:09,417
What?

78
00:05:09,417 --> 00:05:13,125
Mother is linked to us since we were born.

79
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:18,542
But she can't be monitoring just
one family member, right? She has many spiders.

80
00:05:18,542 --> 00:05:23,375
Since our existence isn't ordinary,
she might have targeted us.

81
00:05:23,375 --> 00:05:27,125
If that's the case, the last attack...

82
00:05:27,875 --> 00:05:30,542
In order to make us think we have no chance
of winning and not have us escape,

83
00:05:30,542 --> 00:05:34,208
she sent just enough combat power to attack us.

84
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:37,458
I think mother is very intelligent.

85
00:05:37,458 --> 00:05:40,125
If that's the case, it's weird indeed that

86
00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:41,500
she's not taking any actions.

87
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,792
Could she be waiting?

88
00:05:43,792 --> 00:05:46,167
What is she waiting for?

89
00:05:46,167 --> 00:05:48,083
How would I know?

90
00:05:49,792 --> 00:05:51,667
What's that noise?

91
00:06:04,917 --> 00:06:06,542
What is she planning to do?

92
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:17,167
We're fooled.

93
00:06:17,167 --> 00:06:18,917
Contact our Body, hurry!

94
00:06:18,917 --> 00:06:20,292
Okay.

95
00:06:20,292 --> 00:06:21,375
It hurts!

96
00:06:22,208 --> 00:06:23,125
What happened?

97
00:06:23,125 --> 00:06:26,708
I can't pass. I seem to be hindered by mother.

98
00:06:26,708 --> 00:06:29,500
She blocked our communication with our Body.

99
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:34,042
Is she keeping silent
to wait for the chance to block it?

100
00:06:34,042 --> 00:06:36,708
Then send out all her subordinates at one go.

101
00:06:36,708 --> 00:06:39,167
Oh my, mother is being serious.

102
00:06:39,167 --> 00:06:42,750
She plans to kill our Body in a breath.

103
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:46,125
What do we do?

104
00:06:46,125 --> 00:06:48,750
We can't do anything.

105
00:06:50,125 --> 00:06:54,333
The person in charge of information,
the hypothesis of mother can't go outside

106
00:06:54,333 --> 00:06:55,792
has been overthrown.

107
00:06:58,167 --> 00:07:01,958
What should I eat today?

108
00:07:01,958 --> 00:07:05,500
I wonder if there are wild boars
or deer in this world.

109
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:08,583
If there's any,
I can cook wild boar or deer hot pot.

110
00:07:08,583 --> 00:07:13,000
After that, I can have some delicious fruits.

111
00:07:14,542 --> 00:07:16,833
So exciting!

112
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,583
I found fruits so quickly.

113
00:07:19,583 --> 00:07:22,583
I didn't expect the dessert to appear first.
But it's fine.

114
00:07:25,167 --> 00:07:30,417
This is so delicious and sweet. Awesome!

115
00:07:30,417 --> 00:07:34,000
It's great to be out.

116
00:07:35,125 --> 00:07:36,333
The floor is vibrating.

117
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:41,667
Oh no! I have to escape here.

118
00:07:54,458 --> 00:07:59,208
Why is mother outside?

119
00:07:59,208 --> 00:08:01,375
Monster! She's a monster!

120
00:08:01,375 --> 00:08:04,583
"QUEEN TARATECT. WEAKENING. LEVEL 89"
She's five times stronger than Araba!

121
00:08:04,583 --> 00:08:07,792
How can I defeat her?

122
00:08:07,792 --> 00:08:08,958
Run!

123
00:08:11,375 --> 00:08:21,208
Run!

124
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:30,542
Why didn't my parallel wills
inform me immediately?

125
00:08:30,542 --> 00:08:33,458
Hello?

126
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:37,832
Could the communication be blocked?

127
00:08:37,832 --> 00:08:39,624
This is bad!

128
00:08:39,625 --> 00:08:45,375
How did she leave the labyrinth?
Why does she know I'm here?

129
00:08:45,375 --> 00:08:49,708
Although there are much to think about,
I should think about them later.

130
00:08:51,542 --> 00:08:53,833
Use Teleport Magic quickly.

131
00:08:54,667 --> 00:08:59,167
Although I have Ultimate Wizard skill,
teleporting far is still time consuming.

132
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:09,375
The movement alone is harmful enough,
if I was hit I will surely be dead instantly.

133
00:09:10,875 --> 00:09:11,833
Oh my!

134
00:09:13,667 --> 00:09:19,625
She can attack fiercely while moving.
This is cunning.

135
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:22,625
Hurry up with the magic.

136
00:09:22,625 --> 00:09:24,792
I'm going to be caught.

137
00:09:24,792 --> 00:09:26,208
So close!

138
00:09:32,458 --> 00:09:35,292
I can't escape...

139
00:09:47,583 --> 00:09:50,250
That was close.

140
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:55,000
If I were to be one second slower,
I would be dead.

141
00:09:56,042 --> 00:09:58,708
I was wondering why it's so tough to walk.

142
00:09:58,708 --> 00:10:04,958
I was finally out. But I can only
stay in my old nest before I recover.

143
00:10:13,708 --> 00:10:18,875
There are two Arch Taratects
and many small spiders.

144
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:27,750
What?

145
00:10:33,083 --> 00:10:37,875
Them showing up at this point
means this is mother's trap.

146
00:10:37,875 --> 00:10:43,000
She expected me to teleport home?

147
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,375
I have perhaps
underestimated mother's intelligence.

148
00:10:53,708 --> 00:10:55,250
Venom...

149
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:59,875
Even with my strong endurance,
this situation is bad.

150
00:11:11,083 --> 00:11:12,500
Five of them?

151
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:16,458
Mother, do you really want to kill your child?

152
00:11:16,458 --> 00:11:20,417
If I didn't have the endurance skill,
I would have been dead by now.

153
00:11:20,417 --> 00:11:22,875
Once MP value is used up, I will surely be dead.

154
00:11:22,875 --> 00:11:27,042
Fortunately I have Ultimate Wizard skill,
my MP value can recover automatically.

155
00:11:27,042 --> 00:11:29,833
Although I won't die so quickly,

156
00:11:29,833 --> 00:11:33,083
I might die if I'm injured so badly
that I can't recover in time.

157
00:11:38,875 --> 00:11:40,958
This situation is becoming worse.

158
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:44,333
Only in Middle Stratum I can
defeat all of them at the same time.

159
00:11:47,125 --> 00:11:49,167
But I have no chance to escape.

160
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Since there's no chance,
I have to create it myself.

161
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,333
Venomous fog.

162
00:12:02,833 --> 00:12:05,208
Good. That was successful.

163
00:12:07,083 --> 00:12:08,542
It's seen through so soon.

164
00:12:08,542 --> 00:12:11,542
Is there no chance to teleport?

165
00:12:16,125 --> 00:12:18,333
Very well. I finally got rid of them.

166
00:12:18,333 --> 00:12:20,458
Next...

167
00:12:20,458 --> 00:12:24,333
Let's see who can stand
the heat better in Middle Stratum.

168
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:26,333
I see it.

169
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:34,458
What is this? A puppet?

170
00:12:40,083 --> 00:12:41,583
That was fast.

171
00:12:41,583 --> 00:12:42,792
It can actually use weapons.

172
00:12:42,792 --> 00:12:46,083
This is too powerful.

173
00:12:52,125 --> 00:12:53,958
That's the Body.

174
00:12:53,958 --> 00:12:57,292
Isn't that a very strong little spider?

175
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,958
That is definitely mother's trump card.

176
00:13:03,375 --> 00:13:06,958
The Puppet Taratect is ahead
and the Arch Taratects are at the back.

177
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:08,875
There are even five of them.

178
00:13:08,875 --> 00:13:13,083
I lost my front and back legs
so I can't move freely.

179
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:17,167
They're not giving me
the chance to teleport at all.

180
00:13:17,167 --> 00:13:21,292
The only way to Middle Stratum
is blocked by Puppet Taratect as well.

181
00:13:27,583 --> 00:13:32,667
This situation is deadlier than
the fight with Araba.

182
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:37,208
I don't want to die!

183
00:13:39,583 --> 00:13:43,208
I will not give up!

184
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,583
Diablo Bullets!

185
00:14:02,167 --> 00:14:04,250
I will have one eye to see the future.

186
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:08,167
The rest shall be used for Evil Eyes.
Absorb MP level.

187
00:14:08,167 --> 00:14:11,417
Keep firing Diablo Bullets.

188
00:14:13,125 --> 00:14:15,375
Good. I can keep distance like this.

189
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:19,292
I must keep this state until I heal.
Let's think about the next step.

190
00:14:20,792 --> 00:14:23,167
Can I stop them just by using Diablo Bullets?

191
00:14:27,208 --> 00:14:29,042
Diablo Gun!

192
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,292
Diablo Gun!

193
00:14:33,292 --> 00:14:34,500
Diablo Bullets!

194
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,125
Diablo Gun!

195
00:14:36,583 --> 00:14:41,542
Cursed you. I can't use Diablo Gun
and Diablo Bullets at the same time.

196
00:14:41,542 --> 00:14:45,917
If my parallel wills are here,
we can shoot together.

197
00:14:49,917 --> 00:14:53,167
It's good that Arch Taratects
aren't attacking at the same time,

198
00:14:53,167 --> 00:14:57,167
but the path to Middle Stratum
shouldn't be blocked.

199
00:14:57,167 --> 00:14:58,375
Hey!

200
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:10,250
Escaping this way will only make Middle Stratum
further away. The leeway is also blocked.

201
00:15:13,417 --> 00:15:18,083
It's annoying. Quiet down!

202
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:21,667
I can't find a point to break through.
What should I do?

203
00:15:22,542 --> 00:15:25,125
It will be great if my level upgrades.

204
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:29,625
But I just upgraded.
My experience level isn't enough yet.

205
00:15:29,625 --> 00:15:31,625
Oh, right. Although they're just lackeys,

206
00:15:31,625 --> 00:15:35,333
I defeated many Small Taratects.

207
00:15:35,333 --> 00:15:37,708
This is the power of accumulation.

208
00:15:38,625 --> 00:15:41,000
I think they're the easiest to defeat.

209
00:15:44,333 --> 00:15:46,542
Oh no!

210
00:16:04,458 --> 00:16:07,792
Phoenix Fantasy... No.

211
00:16:07,792 --> 00:16:11,083
"GAIDO MAGIC. FANTASY"
Gaido Magic. Fantasy.

212
00:16:11,083 --> 00:16:14,292
Everything you see is just a delusion.

213
00:16:27,625 --> 00:16:28,625
INSIDIOUS

214
00:16:28,625 --> 00:16:31,833
I left marks on you so I can see clearly.

215
00:16:31,833 --> 00:16:34,750
Being initiative has a higher chance of winning.

216
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:36,500
I'm going to win...

217
00:16:47,875 --> 00:16:50,625
This is the puppet's trap.

218
00:16:50,625 --> 00:16:52,583
I must break free quickly.

219
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:09,083
My body is going to be squashed.

220
00:17:14,625 --> 00:17:17,500
I can only use Destructive Evil Eye.

221
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:21,833
But if I still can't defeat
the Arch Taratects...

222
00:17:24,833 --> 00:17:30,375
I have no time... to hesitate.

223
00:17:35,958 --> 00:17:38,167
Awesome! Did it work?

224
00:17:41,542 --> 00:17:43,333
Seriously?

225
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:46,500
It can still move after losing half a face?

226
00:17:48,875 --> 00:17:54,833
If even this doesn't work,
I can only get to the other world.

227
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,792
I've recovered.

228
00:18:10,542 --> 00:18:13,042
Take my venomous fangs!

229
00:18:25,208 --> 00:18:27,792
Okay. Now...

230
00:18:30,125 --> 00:18:34,417
You did notice that I want to attack you.

231
00:18:34,417 --> 00:18:36,958
You're planning to kill me
with the Arch Taratects, right?

232
00:18:38,125 --> 00:18:41,125
But you're too late.

233
00:19:01,125 --> 00:19:03,667
That was close but it was successful.

234
00:19:03,667 --> 00:19:08,042
If I don't retreat quickly,
I will be burnt to ashes.

235
00:19:12,667 --> 00:19:14,583
That was a crucial moment.

236
00:19:14,583 --> 00:19:19,333
If I made a wrong judgement, I might be dead.

237
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:25,917
By the way, the Puppet Taratect
wasn't one of the evolution options.

238
00:19:25,917 --> 00:19:29,333
Is it a special individual different
from the general evolution?

239
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:34,667
Since I can't figure this out, I should
start from collecting information about mother.

240
00:19:34,667 --> 00:19:39,542
But I still can't contact my parallel wills.

241
00:19:39,542 --> 00:19:41,708
Whatever. I shall evolve first.

242
00:19:41,708 --> 00:19:44,958
Since I still have to fight
some unreasonably strong opponents.

243
00:19:45,792 --> 00:19:49,167
"EVOLUTION OPTION: ZANA HOROWA"
The monsters around here will not come near me.

244
00:19:49,167 --> 00:19:53,167
I will have Arch Taratects as nutrient source
after the evolution. So no problem.

245
00:19:53,167 --> 00:19:56,125
Okay. Let's evolve.

246
00:19:56,125 --> 00:20:00,417
Ede Saines evolves into Zana Horowa.

247
00:20:28,167 --> 00:20:31,625
♫This is annoying. I'm sure I won♫

248
00:20:31,625 --> 00:20:34,625

264
00:21:39,625 --> 00:21:41,167
Sue...

265
00:21:43,917 --> 00:21:46,667
Shun, perhaps this will make you feel better.

266
00:21:46,667 --> 00:21:50,417
As long as she's still brainwashed,
she won't be killed.

267
00:21:57,333 --> 00:22:02,875
If I were more useful,
Sue and Katia wouldn't have gone through this.

268
00:22:02,875 --> 00:22:04,708
Don't blame yourself.

269
00:22:04,708 --> 00:22:09,125
If you hadn't saved me with your skill,
I would be dead.

270
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,042
Please get over here.

271
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:18,042
The situation isn't too optimistic.

272
00:22:18,042 --> 00:22:23,875
With the control of the church,
Prince Hugo is controlling the world.

273
00:22:23,875 --> 00:22:28,667
If he's left alone like this,
the Demon Clan will take advantage of it.

274
00:22:28,667 --> 00:22:33,583
Hugo seems to be leading a troop
to attack the Elf Village.

275
00:22:33,583 --> 00:22:37,375
Then let's get there first to ambush him.

276
00:22:37,375 --> 00:22:39,000
There's a problem.

277
00:22:39,875 --> 00:22:40,958
Look.

278
00:22:41,667 --> 00:22:47,750
We have to take this path
to get to Elf Village from here.

279
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:49,500
What's the problem you mentioned?

280
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:55,208
We have to go through the world
biggest labyrinth,The Great Elroe Labyrinth.

281
00:22:55,208 --> 00:22:59,208
That place is inhabited
by many dangerous monsters.

282
00:23:03,167 --> 00:23:05,042
What about other routes?

283
00:23:05,042 --> 00:23:05,917
There's none.

284
00:23:05,917 --> 00:23:08,417
It seems we have no other way.

285
00:23:09,417 --> 00:23:13,208
We can't let the country
go down without doing anything.

286
00:23:13,208 --> 00:23:16,083
I would like to go back once again.

287
00:23:16,083 --> 00:23:17,208
Shun...

288
00:23:18,375 --> 00:23:22,958
As the true Warrior, you have to fight
the fake Warrior who betrayed the humankind.

289
00:23:22,958 --> 00:23:25,125
Fight Prince Hugo.

290
00:23:27,125 --> 00:23:28,583
Of course.

291
00:23:36,333 --> 00:23:39,000
SO I'M A SPIDER, SO WHAT?
NEXT EPISODE: FLYING, OBTAINED

292
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,458
STAY TUNED
