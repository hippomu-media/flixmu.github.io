1
00:00:00,375 --> 00:00:03,000
Why do you look so content?

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,292
Because you've tried your best,
so you don't regret it?

3
00:00:07,292 --> 00:00:10,500
Why did you give up so easily?

4
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,792
You should be greedier.

5
00:00:12,792 --> 00:00:16,042
You should have begged for your life.

6
00:00:16,042 --> 00:00:19,625
Who am I, who struggle to survive,

7
00:00:19,625 --> 00:00:26,333
who do everything to live?

8
00:00:26,333 --> 00:00:28,750
Araba!

9
00:00:38,167 --> 00:00:41,083
I was attacked by
various creatures after reincarnation,

10
00:00:41,083 --> 00:00:45,125
as if I was in a field battle.

11
00:00:45,125 --> 00:00:49,708
I can finally go to the outside-world.

12
00:00:49,708 --> 00:00:51,250
Hooray!

13
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:55,375
It's outside! I'm free!

14
00:00:56,208 --> 00:00:59,625
What is this?

15
00:01:00,042 --> 00:01:04,125
I thought I'm free.
But I'm trapped inside again.

16
00:01:05,833 --> 00:01:07,000
It hurts.

17
00:01:14,792 --> 00:01:16,208
I'm so angry...

18
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:22,167
It isn't a good idea to kill all of them now.
I should just control my power.

19
00:01:34,917 --> 00:01:37,000
You asked for it!

20
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,167
♫The alarm goes off. My name is Little Spider♫

Birdie, how are you?

44
00:03:16,375 --> 00:03:17,833
Butterflies.

45
00:03:18,583 --> 00:03:23,583
I'm not a hungry spider. I will not eat you.

46
00:03:25,625 --> 00:03:29,708
I didn't expect the world to be so colourful.

47
00:03:33,042 --> 00:03:36,833
Seriously? Humans are really noisy.

48
00:03:36,833 --> 00:03:39,833
What's going on?

49
00:03:40,792 --> 00:03:44,083
Okay, forget them.

50
00:03:44,083 --> 00:03:47,708
Let's see where I can find good food.

51
00:03:52,542 --> 00:03:56,000
It's a town! Perhaps there are desserts.

52
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,250
Hold on.

53
00:03:57,708 --> 00:04:03,708
Hi, I'm an adorable little spider.
Please give me something sweet to eat.

54
00:04:03,708 --> 00:04:05,458
A monster!

55
00:04:05,458 --> 00:04:06,958
Kill her!

56
00:04:12,833 --> 00:04:15,792
I'm sure that's what will happen.

57
00:04:15,792 --> 00:04:17,083
Forget it, then.

58
00:04:18,708 --> 00:04:22,000
I wonder if I can turn to
human form after evolution.

59
00:04:25,167 --> 00:04:27,208
Spider Lady.

60
00:04:27,208 --> 00:04:28,792
This is...

61
00:04:30,125 --> 00:04:32,167
A human's upper body.

62
00:04:32,167 --> 00:04:35,917
If I can evolve to this state,
the chance of being hunted will decrease.

63
00:04:35,917 --> 00:04:37,083
That's right.

64
00:04:37,708 --> 00:04:40,667
Compared to an innocent spider, a human face

65
00:04:40,667 --> 00:04:42,542
can make people be less alert.

66
00:04:42,542 --> 00:04:45,750
Perhaps. Plausible. For sure. Maybe.

67
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:49,458
I want to work towards Spider Lady.

68
00:04:51,417 --> 00:04:54,750
I'm a hungry spider.

69
00:04:58,042 --> 00:04:59,833
Forget it.

70
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:01,000
Hey.

71
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,583
This is not a labyrinth without any good food.

72
00:05:04,583 --> 00:05:07,708
There should be some delicious food.

73
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:08,625
Let's see.

74
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:10,750
I don't care if it's some mushrooms,
bamboo shoots or chocolate.

75
00:05:14,708 --> 00:05:15,958
What's going on?

76
00:05:18,583 --> 00:05:19,917
Mother?

77
00:05:19,917 --> 00:05:22,083
What? You want me to be back?

78
00:05:22,083 --> 00:05:25,333
Family Domination. What is this?

79
00:05:26,875 --> 00:05:28,250
Do they mean it literally?

80
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:33,083
Turns out mother has
the ability to control her children.

81
00:05:34,833 --> 00:05:39,583
That means I have to go back to the labyrinth.

82
00:05:39,583 --> 00:05:40,500
Perhaps not.

83
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:43,792
"INVALID GAIDO"
I see. Thanks to this.

84
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:48,500
I will not obey to orders.

85
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:51,292
I insist on rejecting such orders.

86
00:05:51,292 --> 00:05:55,167
No. I'm a Japanese person
who knows how to say no.

87
00:05:55,167 --> 00:05:57,792
But I'm neither Japanese nor a person now.

88
00:05:58,667 --> 00:06:01,875
I feel that mother is very angry.

89
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,917
You shall be mad underground forever.

90
00:06:08,917 --> 00:06:12,542
After all, you will not be able
to be out with your big body.

91
00:06:12,542 --> 00:06:14,333
Goodbye, mother.

92
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:18,667
I, who defeated Araba,
am not afraid of my weak mother.

93
00:06:18,667 --> 00:06:21,875
Let's go look for some good food.

94
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:27,750
I'm coming in.

95
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:29,792
It's time to go.

96
00:06:29,792 --> 00:06:32,125
Okay, I get it.

97
00:06:37,792 --> 00:06:39,000
Hi.

98
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:42,167
Brother Hyrince.

99
00:06:42,167 --> 00:06:44,292
How are you, Shun?

100
00:06:44,958 --> 00:06:47,833
Odd. Isn't she...

101
00:06:47,833 --> 00:06:53,750
She's Anna, my servant.
She has been serving me since I was small.

102
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:57,583
I'm Anna. Long time no see, Mr. Hyrince.

103
00:06:57,583 --> 00:07:03,958
I've seen you many times when I visited
the castle with Julius. Nice to see you.

104
00:07:03,958 --> 00:07:07,000
Shun, do you want
to have dinner with me tonight?

105
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,042
Sorry. I have a meeting
with the clan leader of the elves.

106
00:07:11,042 --> 00:07:15,250
I see. What a shame. Let's do it next time then.

107
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:16,083
Okay.

108
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:25,417
I'm the clan leader of the elves, Potimas.

109
00:07:25,417 --> 00:07:28,583
I'm Filimøs. Nice to meet you.

110
00:07:28,583 --> 00:07:33,458
Your Highness Potimas, these are my sons.

111
00:07:34,208 --> 00:07:38,417
I'm Cylis. Nice to meet you.

112
00:07:38,417 --> 00:07:42,417
I'm Leston.
Regarding the great deeds of Potimas, Oka...

113
00:07:43,917 --> 00:07:46,375
Filimøs has told us about it.

114
00:07:48,458 --> 00:07:52,000
I'm Schlain. Nice to meet you.

115
00:07:56,458 --> 00:08:04,625
I believe the fellow elves know
that the humans and demons are having war.

116
00:08:04,625 --> 00:08:11,958
In order to avoid wars, I wanted to
reconcile with Demon Clan. We negotiated,

117
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:16,458
but I wasn't capable enough
and caused conflicts.

118
00:08:16,458 --> 00:08:20,833
If I could do better, Julius wouldn't...

119
00:08:22,542 --> 00:08:26,208
You've tried your best to convince them.

120
00:08:26,208 --> 00:08:29,417
This is an unavoidable war.

121
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:36,125
Things that have happened can't be turned back.

122
00:08:36,125 --> 00:08:39,625
What happened to Julius is a shame,
but instead of missing him,

123
00:08:39,625 --> 00:08:44,292
we should figure out
a strategy to deal with them.

124
00:08:44,292 --> 00:08:47,208
Fortunately, we have a new Warrior.

125
00:08:47,208 --> 00:08:52,250
I think we should have Schlain in battle
as soon as possible to stop them.

126
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:57,208
Brother, Schlain is just a student.
How can you have in a battle?

127
00:08:57,208 --> 00:09:02,750
Julius was even younger than him
when he was battling as Warrior.

128
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:06,458
I...

129
00:09:09,667 --> 00:09:13,125
No. The battle situation is still unclear.

130
00:09:13,125 --> 00:09:18,125
It's not the best idea
to rush to send the Warrior to the field.

131
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:19,875
But father...

132
00:09:19,875 --> 00:09:22,792
King Analeit is right.

133
00:09:22,792 --> 00:09:25,917
Why do you say so, Mr. Potimas?

134
00:09:25,917 --> 00:09:27,833
The current Devil...

135
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:36,500
She has stronger power than any previous Devil.

136
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:41,083
I suffered because of her as well.

137
00:09:41,083 --> 00:09:47,500
Since she became Devil, the successful
communication with Demon Clan has been stopped.

138
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:52,000
Besides, she has subordinates
that are hard to deal with.

139
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,083
Therefore, it's not wise to do anything
before having intelligence.

140
00:09:59,083 --> 00:10:00,542
Is there anything?

141
00:10:00,542 --> 00:10:05,875
After you became Warrior, you have to
deal with The Religion of God Words often.

142
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:13,292
It seems the current Warrior
doesn't like The Religion of God Words.

143
00:10:13,292 --> 00:10:15,250
No. There's no such thing.

144
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:17,042
It's okay. That's good.

145
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:21,250
The pontiff of
The Religion of God Words, Dustin,

146
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:26,042
may look like a friendly old man,
but never open yourself to him.

147
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:32,083
Lest you will be like your brother,
being abandoned after he makes use of your soul.

148
00:10:32,083 --> 00:10:33,667
What does that mean?

149
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,250
Half-elf?

150
00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:11,375
It's been awhile since Schlain was chosen
as Warrior and brought back to the castle.

151
00:11:11,375 --> 00:11:13,458
How is he now?

152
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:18,667
The door isn't locked.

153
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:24,917
Katia...

154
00:11:27,292 --> 00:11:30,208
Sue, are you alright?

155
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:37,500
I'm very sad about Brother Julius' death.
I'm of course worried about Brother Schlain too.

156
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:40,708
But I'm fine.

157
00:11:42,125 --> 00:11:45,250
Because he's my brother.

158
00:11:46,125 --> 00:11:48,958
Yes. You're right.

159
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,292
Hi, you two.

160
00:11:54,292 --> 00:11:58,458
Hugo, didn't you leave the school?

161
00:11:58,458 --> 00:12:02,125
I need your help.

162
00:12:02,125 --> 00:12:02,833
Help?

163
00:12:02,833 --> 00:12:05,792
Yes. However...

164
00:12:09,833 --> 00:12:13,000
It's a request you can't reject.

165
00:12:21,167 --> 00:12:22,292
Please wait where you are.

166
00:12:22,292 --> 00:12:23,458
Okay.

167
00:12:24,375 --> 00:12:25,542
What happened?

168
00:12:46,708 --> 00:12:49,833
SO I'M A SPIDER, SO WHAT?

169
00:12:55,792 --> 00:12:58,833
I'm so happy to have a walk.

170
00:12:58,833 --> 00:13:04,333
Although I only left home
for school in my past life,

171
00:13:04,333 --> 00:13:09,208
I'm now a good and healthy baby who has walks.

172
00:13:13,542 --> 00:13:18,500
INVESTIGATION

173
00:13:21,792 --> 00:13:24,333
Mother's subordinates.

174
00:13:24,333 --> 00:13:27,417
They look very angry.

175
00:13:27,417 --> 00:13:29,417
"ARCH TARATECT LEVEL 31"
Let's see. Seriously?

176
00:13:29,417 --> 00:13:33,125
Its ability value is as good as Araba's.

177
00:13:33,125 --> 00:13:35,667
The leader is an Arch Taratect.

178
00:13:35,667 --> 00:13:40,667
There are three Greater Taratects.
They're strong as well.

179
00:13:40,667 --> 00:13:42,542
And some other spiders.

180
00:13:43,208 --> 00:13:45,958
I can only... fight!

181
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:56,583
I've been waiting for you, brothers and sisters.

182
00:13:56,583 --> 00:13:59,000
This is your cemetery.

183
00:14:00,917 --> 00:14:04,208
Bring it on and fall into the trap.

184
00:14:10,333 --> 00:14:12,208
They found it out immediately.

185
00:14:25,083 --> 00:14:27,667
There isn't just one trap.

186
00:14:29,292 --> 00:14:34,583
Come on. Have a taste of my Diablo Bullets.

187
00:14:40,875 --> 00:14:43,792
I've revenged!

188
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:52,167
It's indeed hard to defeat taratects
which are as good as dragons.

189
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:55,958
Oh no! It's spider silks!

190
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:03,458
It can actually turn automatically.

191
00:15:05,375 --> 00:15:07,000
"LEVEL 10 SILK CONTROL"
They're my siblings indeed.

192
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,125
It's no wonder they have the same skills.

193
00:15:10,125 --> 00:15:14,375
The main weapon of the Arch Taratect is
level 10 deadly venom attack, silk control

194
00:15:14,375 --> 00:15:17,667
and Utility Silk.

195
00:15:17,667 --> 00:15:22,750
Its ability value is as high as a dragon's
and it has powerful companions.

196
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:25,250
I can't win if they attack together.

197
00:15:26,833 --> 00:15:29,917
So I won't attack you all at the same time.

198
00:15:31,292 --> 00:15:33,417
Okay. Almost there.

199
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:35,750
Oh no!

200
00:15:46,625 --> 00:15:49,083
I almost got killed.

201
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:51,375
I will not be killed by you.

202
00:15:54,083 --> 00:15:55,792
There it is.

203
00:16:13,917 --> 00:16:17,792
With such a huge body size,
you won't be able to escape the mesh.

204
00:16:19,167 --> 00:16:21,208
Although we can use the same skills,

205
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:25,042
you think you can defeat me,
who has human brain?

206
00:16:26,542 --> 00:16:30,125
Not happy? But the show just about to begin.

207
00:16:32,042 --> 00:16:33,708
Take this!

208
00:16:33,708 --> 00:16:35,708
Killing strike!

209
00:16:35,708 --> 00:16:38,750
Spatial magic, Teleport!

210
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,542
How does it feel? Hot?

211
00:16:42,542 --> 00:16:47,208
Very hot, right? I feel it too.

212
00:16:48,417 --> 00:16:54,083
The attraction of Middle Stratum,
Great Elroe Labyrinth. Enjoy the lava.

213
00:16:54,083 --> 00:16:57,625
Drop into the hot lava.

214
00:16:59,625 --> 00:17:01,125
It's Spatial Maneuver.

215
00:17:08,791 --> 00:17:14,416
I will die even if I don't let.
I shall just finish this first.

216
00:17:16,458 --> 00:17:17,875
Take this!

217
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,791
Take this! Break and fall!

218
00:17:24,791 --> 00:17:26,999
Die!

219
00:17:34,958 --> 00:17:36,208
Healing Magic?

220
00:17:36,208 --> 00:17:38,292
It actually has such a skill.

221
00:17:40,708 --> 00:17:46,583
Besides, the floor seems to have increased.
It could hold longer.

222
00:17:46,583 --> 00:17:50,083
Its resistance against Diablo Bullets
has increased as well.

223
00:17:50,083 --> 00:17:52,375
Oh no!

224
00:17:52,375 --> 00:17:55,833
If I don't deal with this fast,
it will get even worse.

225
00:17:55,833 --> 00:17:57,208
How could there be such a stupid thing?

226
00:17:57,208 --> 00:18:01,167
The situation was
favourable for me yet I couldn't kill it.

227
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:05,458
Die!

228
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:23,083
Don't waste food.

229
00:18:25,458 --> 00:18:31,292
That was close.
It almost turned defeat into victory.

230
00:18:32,333 --> 00:18:35,542
Experience achieved a certain target.

231
00:18:37,417 --> 00:18:39,708
I had a two-level upgrade.

232
00:18:41,542 --> 00:18:44,708
Although being dangerous, you're very delicious.

233
00:18:47,625 --> 00:18:51,500
Let's have dessert
after the delicious main course.

234
00:18:57,708 --> 00:18:59,083
You're shivering out of fear.

235
00:18:59,083 --> 00:19:03,333
If your superior saw this,
it would have retreated as well.

236
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:05,000
Teleport.

237
00:19:09,125 --> 00:19:10,208
Watch this.

238
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:14,250
Don't waste food.

239
00:19:17,708 --> 00:19:19,208
I'm finally outside

240
00:19:19,208 --> 00:19:23,625
yet I'm eating the same food as inside.

241
00:19:29,583 --> 00:19:32,750
Another angry message from mother.

242
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:38,417
She's really mad.

243
00:19:38,417 --> 00:19:43,625
I don't want to obey her order at all
and this is annoying.

244
00:19:43,625 --> 00:19:47,000
Can't I just unplug it like a phone?

245
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:53,083
That means there's a channel
between mother and I.

246
00:19:55,042 --> 00:19:56,750
It's time.

247
00:19:57,833 --> 00:19:59,125
What's the matter?

248
00:19:59,125 --> 00:20:01,708
I have to say goodbye to you temporarily.

249
00:20:01,708 --> 00:20:03,500
What are you talking about?

250
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,333
What does this mean?

251
00:20:06,208 --> 00:20:08,708
I want to fight back.

252
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:09,792
What?

253
00:20:09,792 --> 00:20:11,000
Fight back?

254
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,458
Please go to mother.

255
00:20:14,458 --> 00:20:16,292
What do you mean?

256
00:20:16,292 --> 00:20:17,708
I want the three of you

257
00:20:17,708 --> 00:20:23,542
to launch an attack on mother
along this channel that connects to her.

258
00:20:23,542 --> 00:20:26,958
That sounds sinister.

259
00:20:26,958 --> 00:20:31,667
After all, it's connected to mother's spirit.

260
00:20:31,667 --> 00:20:33,542
Me!

261
00:20:33,542 --> 00:20:36,208
Speak up, the person of magic number one.

262
00:20:36,208 --> 00:20:39,667
What specifically do you mean by attack?

263
00:20:43,917 --> 00:20:45,917
I don't know.

264
00:20:45,917 --> 00:20:47,292
What?

265
00:20:48,042 --> 00:20:49,708
You don't know either?

266
00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:55,208
Don't worry.
We can do it as long as we work hard for it.

267
00:20:55,208 --> 00:20:58,000
It's better than doing nothing.

268
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,708
Never try, never know.

269
00:21:01,708 --> 00:21:03,042
That's right.

270
00:21:03,042 --> 00:21:05,167
That's all, everyone.

271
00:21:06,083 --> 00:21:07,833
Thank you so much.

272
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:09,167
Roger.

273
00:21:09,167 --> 00:21:11,000
Nosukezaemon.

274
00:21:19,417 --> 00:21:22,542
Here it is. Engulf her spirit.

275
00:21:22,542 --> 00:21:24,125
Yes.

276
00:21:29,708 --> 00:21:32,500

That's great.

296

Wait and see, Schlain.
