1
00:00:08,667 --> 00:00:12,667
In the end, who's the person named D?

2
00:00:12,667 --> 00:00:17,208
If she really gave us Wisdom, that could mean she's the admin.

3
00:00:17,208 --> 00:00:20,667
Yes, that's your reward.

4
00:00:20,667 --> 00:00:24,708
If she's the admin in charge of skills...

5
00:00:24,708 --> 00:00:26,708
Then she must have something in mind.

6
00:00:26,708 --> 00:00:31,208
Besides, D speaks Japanese fluently.

7
00:00:31,208 --> 00:00:33,333
And the smartphone appeared.

8
00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:35,458
In other words, we see the shadow of Japan.

9
00:00:35,458 --> 00:00:37,042
That's right.

10
00:00:37,042 --> 00:00:40,458
D, this world and Earth are probably related.

11
00:00:40,458 --> 00:00:44,333
She should know the reason we're reincarnated into this world.

12
00:00:44,333 --> 00:00:46,250
She will not answer even if we ask her.

13
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:48,417
I want to know!

14
00:00:48,417 --> 00:00:53,333
As the person in charge of information, I'm trying to process all the information.

15
00:00:53,333 --> 00:00:56,333
How am I suppose to work if you keep whining?

16
00:00:56,333 --> 00:00:59,375
I can't process it at all!

17
00:00:59,375 --> 00:01:00,833
Sorry.

18
00:01:00,833 --> 00:01:06,708
But thanks to your nagging, I have an answer!

19
00:01:06,708 --> 00:01:07,833
What?

20
00:01:07,833 --> 00:01:10,542
Which is...

21
00:01:11,583 --> 00:01:13,292
There's no point cracking our head on this.

22
00:01:13,292 --> 00:01:14,542
What?

23
00:01:14,542 --> 00:01:17,292
We should focus on doing things we can,

24
00:01:17,292 --> 00:01:20,875
which is crossing Middle Stratum.

25
00:01:22,167 --> 00:01:27,042
Besides, I've used my skill points to redeem Spatial Magic.

26
00:01:28,167 --> 00:01:31,375
Which is what the man in black used.

27
00:01:32,125 --> 00:01:34,083
I think that skill is useful.

28
00:01:34,083 --> 00:01:38,083
Once Spatial Magic is obtained, we can go upstairs in an instant.

29
00:01:38,083 --> 00:01:40,167
Why didn't you say this earlier?

30
00:01:40,167 --> 00:01:41,083
No...

31
00:01:41,083 --> 00:01:46,208
Because it's tough to cast Spatial Magic.

32
00:01:48,208 --> 00:01:50,792
Are we thinking too simple?

33
00:01:50,792 --> 00:01:54,875
It's as sweet as pouring condensed milk and three buckets of sugar on syrup.

34
00:01:54,875 --> 00:01:56,875
But hold on...

35
00:01:56,875 --> 00:02:01,042
Isn't that the road leading to Upper Stratum?

36
00:02:02,875 --> 00:02:08,250
We don't need Spatial Magic to reach Upper Stratum.

37
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:10,083
Hooray!

38
00:02:10,083 --> 00:02:14,125

62

SO I'M A SPIDER, SO WHAT?

63
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:43,792
You got the title of Warrior.

64
00:03:43,792 --> 00:03:49,667
You should know what this means, Schlain.

65
00:03:49,667 --> 00:03:51,083
Yes.

66
00:03:52,458 --> 00:03:54,083
Julius...

67
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:15,167
Leston, brother...

68
00:04:19,541 --> 00:04:22,167
Brother Julius is...

69
00:04:22,167 --> 00:04:23,625
Brother is...

70
00:04:28,375 --> 00:04:31,958
Father, I know you're very sad.

71
00:04:31,958 --> 00:04:36,792
But shouldn't we discuss what we should do next?

72
00:04:36,792 --> 00:04:38,583
Brother Cylis.

73
00:04:38,583 --> 00:04:42,458
Can't you be considerate of father's and Shun's feelings?

74
00:04:42,458 --> 00:04:46,708
No. Cylis is right.

75
00:04:46,708 --> 00:04:48,500
Father.

76
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:55,083
Schlain got the title of Warrior, that means Julius is dead.

77
00:04:55,083 --> 00:04:56,833
We're the royal.

78
00:04:56,833 --> 00:05:00,625
We must first fulfill our duty.

79
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:04,292
I didn't expect Julius's successor

80
00:05:04,292 --> 00:05:09,958
to also be one from our country and it's even his brother.

81
00:05:09,958 --> 00:05:11,958
Is this karma as well?

82
00:05:12,792 --> 00:05:18,333
Although the nation is not informed, the league of the Demon Clan is attacking.

83
00:05:19,833 --> 00:05:21,500
Demon Clan?

84
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:26,083
Julius probably lost his life while fighting them.

85
00:05:27,417 --> 00:05:31,583
To create a world with peace and laughter.

86
00:05:33,417 --> 00:05:36,042
That is the dream I pursue,

87
00:05:36,042 --> 00:05:37,667
until death stops me.

88
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:43,292
I'm coming in.

89
00:05:43,292 --> 00:05:46,750
The battle situation with the league of Demon Clan has arrived.

90
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:51,292
Speak up.

91
00:05:51,292 --> 00:05:54,792
Half of the eight fortresses have fallen,

92
00:05:54,792 --> 00:05:58,417
including Kusorion Fortress that has been destroyed.

93
00:05:58,417 --> 00:05:59,958
Kusorion Fortress...

94
00:05:59,958 --> 00:06:02,500
Even the big fortress?

95
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:09,458
Yes. Because the Queen Taratect appeared, there was no way to fight back.

96
00:06:13,042 --> 00:06:17,708
Julius must have been in Kusorion Fortress.

97
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:21,833
We don't know where Mr. Julius was.

98
00:06:23,667 --> 00:06:29,083
The rest of the fortresses fought very hard to fend off Demon Clan.

99
00:06:29,958 --> 00:06:31,375
There's only one place,

100
00:06:31,375 --> 00:06:37,708
Dazarro Fortress commanded by Elder Ronandt had a total victory against the enemy.

101
00:06:38,958 --> 00:06:40,833
I see.

102
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:42,875
Elder Ronandt...

103
00:06:42,875 --> 00:06:46,542
He's known as the strongest wizard among humans, right?

104
00:06:46,542 --> 00:06:50,333
Yes. He's also the master of Brother Julius.

105
00:06:50,333 --> 00:06:53,583
The league of Demon Clan is retreating.

106
00:06:53,583 --> 00:06:55,083
Report complete.

107
00:06:55,083 --> 00:06:56,292
Thank you.

108
00:07:01,833 --> 00:07:03,167
Father.

109
00:07:05,083 --> 00:07:11,583
Do not publish Julius' death and Schlain's new title yet.

110
00:07:13,042 --> 00:07:20,042
If we announce the death of Warrior hastily, the folks may be panic.

111
00:07:20,042 --> 00:07:24,000
They will find out from the intelligence sent back from the battlefield.

112
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,875
Before that, don't spread this out.

113
00:07:27,875 --> 00:07:29,750
I understand.

114
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:33,917
Father, what should I do from now on?

115
00:07:33,917 --> 00:07:38,208
From today on, I will have you leave the school.

116
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:43,917
You must be prepared to be announced as the new Warrior anytime.

117
00:07:43,917 --> 00:07:45,500
Understand?

118
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,875
Yes.

119
00:07:46,875 --> 00:07:49,625
You must be very confused now.

120
00:07:49,625 --> 00:07:53,833
From today on, you must carry on Julius' aspiration as the Warrior,

121
00:07:53,833 --> 00:07:58,917
be the hope of the human race on the front line of the battlefield.

122
00:07:59,958 --> 00:08:01,375
Yes.

123
00:08:01,375 --> 00:08:02,917
You may leave now.

124
00:08:05,833 --> 00:08:07,750
Get some rest.

125
00:08:28,792 --> 00:08:31,667
When this matter is settled, I will see you again.

126
00:08:35,417 --> 00:08:37,375
Brother Julius.

127
00:08:47,542 --> 00:08:50,625
There's no sign of demons in the surrounding 10 km.

128
00:08:50,625 --> 00:08:54,417
Good. Next, let First and Second Squadron guard.

129
00:08:54,417 --> 00:08:56,125
The rest of the soldiers may rest.

130
00:08:56,125 --> 00:08:57,333
Roger.

131
00:08:58,833 --> 00:09:04,833
Not just 10 km, there's no trace of demons in surrounding 30 km.

132
00:09:04,833 --> 00:09:07,500
It seems we won completely.

133
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:10,000
We didn't win completely.

134
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,833
One tenth of the soldiers died in the battlefield.

135
00:09:13,833 --> 00:09:18,458
Thanks to you, we could end the fight with only these many casualties.

136
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:22,250
I heard, other fortresses have rather heavy casualties.

137
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:25,292
Is it because of me?

138
00:09:27,542 --> 00:09:32,042
What humankind can do is limited.

139
00:09:32,875 --> 00:09:36,917
Have you heard about The Nightmare of the Labyrinth?

140
00:09:36,917 --> 00:09:40,417
You mean the mythical monster?

141
00:09:41,875 --> 00:09:45,250
It was 15 years ago...

142
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:57,042
Buirimus, want to take a rest?

143
00:09:57,042 --> 00:09:59,958
Didn't we just take a rest?

144
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:03,042
But that was an hour ago.

145
00:10:04,417 --> 00:10:06,375
It was less than an hour ago.

146
00:10:06,375 --> 00:10:08,875
It hurts!

147
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:10,125
What's going on?

148
00:10:10,125 --> 00:10:13,500
The right leg I injured yesterday is hurting.

149
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:17,708
But you injured your left leg yesterday.

150
00:10:20,167 --> 00:10:21,958
Hurry up.

151
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:26,292
You don't have to walk so fast.

152
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:27,458
Is it because of that?

153
00:10:27,458 --> 00:10:31,792
You want to be back sooner to see your newborn child, right?

154
00:10:31,792 --> 00:10:33,125
That's not it.

155
00:10:33,125 --> 00:10:36,292
Or because you miss your wife?

156
00:10:36,292 --> 00:10:37,625
Mr. Ronandt!

157
00:10:37,625 --> 00:10:39,750
Don't be so angry.

158
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:42,333
Can you be more alert?

159
00:10:42,333 --> 00:10:46,500
Our duty isn't just exploring.

160
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:49,958
Many monsters of Great Elroe Labyrinth

161
00:10:49,958 --> 00:10:54,125
have been leaving their habitats recently,

162
00:10:54,125 --> 00:10:56,625
which caused the mainland to be more and more dangerous.

163
00:10:56,625 --> 00:11:02,375
According to the reports of the discovery teams, the taratect is perhaps the reason.

164
00:11:02,375 --> 00:11:06,500
Its danger level is Level A and it's the trickiest S class.

165
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:09,208
I know, I know.

166
00:11:09,208 --> 00:11:12,875
You mean we should kill it, right?

167
00:11:12,875 --> 00:11:18,708
Things will be fine as long as I'm around. Just follow me.

168
00:11:18,708 --> 00:11:20,417
Mr. Ronandt.

169
00:11:20,417 --> 00:11:23,083
So can we take a rest now?

170
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:24,667
No.

171
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:30,458
Petty!

172
00:11:33,708 --> 00:11:38,792
Are you sure this is the place where the spider is seen?

173
00:11:38,792 --> 00:11:40,917
I suppose so.

174
00:11:40,917 --> 00:11:43,375
Seems like it moved its nest elsewhere.

175
00:11:43,375 --> 00:11:48,500
The road leading to Middle Stratum is nearby. Could it have moved there?

176
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,958
Middle Stratum?

177
00:11:49,958 --> 00:11:54,708
But taratects should be afraid of fire. This speculation seems weak.

178
00:11:55,958 --> 00:11:57,208
What's going on?

179
00:11:57,208 --> 00:11:58,875
I don't know either.

180
00:11:58,875 --> 00:12:01,958
I want to move forward, but my body...

181
00:12:01,958 --> 00:12:02,667
What?

182
00:12:02,667 --> 00:12:03,583
Hold on.

183
00:12:05,083 --> 00:12:08,417
Illuminate it with fire and look carefully.

184
00:12:10,833 --> 00:12:12,167
Silk.

185
00:12:16,167 --> 00:12:18,667
We've perhaps found the right place.

186
00:12:18,667 --> 00:12:21,708
SO I'M A SPIDER, SO WHAT?

187
00:12:24,042 --> 00:12:25,333
Abominable!

188
00:12:25,333 --> 00:12:27,083
Can't it be cut off?

189
00:12:27,083 --> 00:12:29,500
Let me burn them.

190
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,833
It may be a little hot. Don't move around.

191
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:33,042
Okay...

192
00:12:33,042 --> 00:12:34,583
Hold on...

193
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:40,833
It doesn't catch fire easily.

194
00:12:40,833 --> 00:12:43,292
I want to increase the firepower.

195
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:52,333
Oh no, the firepower was too strong.

196
00:12:52,333 --> 00:12:55,083
Seriously? Have mercy on me.

197
00:12:55,083 --> 00:12:56,958
I've done too much.

198
00:12:56,958 --> 00:12:57,750
Yes.

199
00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:02,417
If the house owner is around, it will be very mad.

200
00:13:02,417 --> 00:13:07,667
It didn't appear despite the fire. That means it might have given up this place.

201
00:13:07,667 --> 00:13:10,208
Or maybe it was out coincidentally.

202
00:13:14,667 --> 00:13:17,875
Did a monster do this?

203
00:13:17,875 --> 00:13:20,292
Is it really a monster?

204
00:13:20,292 --> 00:13:23,333
This is the way leading to Middle Stratum.

205
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:33,750
Buirimus.

206
00:13:35,375 --> 00:13:37,875
The house owner is back.

207
00:13:43,458 --> 00:13:45,917
Is it it?

208
00:13:45,917 --> 00:13:47,542
Unbelievable!

209
00:13:49,625 --> 00:13:51,583
What is it?

210
00:13:51,583 --> 00:13:53,333
Mr. Ronandt.

211
00:13:53,333 --> 00:14:01,417
This monster is acting casually while displaying many different skills.

212
00:14:01,417 --> 00:14:03,208
Unbelievable!

213
00:14:12,833 --> 00:14:14,958
It's blocking our way.

214
00:14:19,167 --> 00:14:21,667
Mr. Ronandt, are you okay?

215
00:14:25,875 --> 00:14:29,833
Could that be... the identification skill?

216
00:14:29,833 --> 00:14:30,917
Impossible.

217
00:14:30,917 --> 00:14:34,000
Is the monster identifying me?

218
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,792
THE SICKLE OF DEATH

219
00:14:35,792 --> 00:14:37,333
The Sickle of Death.

220
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:47,792
Such fatal ability values and so many skills.

221
00:14:47,792 --> 00:14:51,292
What? Ultimate... Wizard?

222
00:14:51,292 --> 00:14:54,125
Mr. Ronandt, come on!

223
00:14:54,125 --> 00:14:58,792
It's frightening. This is too frightening.

224
00:15:00,167 --> 00:15:01,750
What?

225
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:03,000
IDENTIFICATION IS HINDERED.

226
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,542
It can even hinder my identification skill.

227
00:15:05,542 --> 00:15:07,125
Mr. Ronandt.

228
00:15:07,125 --> 00:15:08,458
It can't be wrong.

229
00:15:08,458 --> 00:15:11,458
It must have caused the abnormality in the labyrinth.

230
00:15:11,458 --> 00:15:14,333
The monsters wanted to escape this force.

231
00:15:15,542 --> 00:15:16,500
Retreat!

232
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:17,833
Retreat, hurry!

233
00:15:22,083 --> 00:15:23,417
Stop!

234
00:15:26,875 --> 00:15:29,875
I don't know what happened.

235
00:15:29,875 --> 00:15:33,458
This wisdom and strength are beyond my reach.

236
00:15:33,458 --> 00:15:34,292
Let me go!

237
00:15:34,292 --> 00:15:37,333
I want to look at its strength closely.

238
00:15:37,333 --> 00:15:38,958
Mr. Ronandt.

239
00:15:42,667 --> 00:15:43,792
Come on!

240
00:15:43,792 --> 00:15:45,917
If you keep being like this, we will all be dead.

241
00:15:46,875 --> 00:15:50,125
Sorry, it doesn't matter anymore.

242
00:15:51,542 --> 00:15:55,000
Even if we want to retreat, with the road block, we can't.

243
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,083
It will not let us pass as well.

244
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:03,708
In that case, we can only escape with Mass Teleport.

245
00:16:03,708 --> 00:16:05,458
I understand.

246
00:16:05,458 --> 00:16:07,583
Protect Mr. Ronandt.

247
00:16:07,583 --> 00:16:09,292
Roger.

248
00:16:09,292 --> 00:16:14,917
Mr. Ronandt wants to perform Mass Teleport. We're in charge of buying time.

249
00:16:16,333 --> 00:16:17,542
Kirekock!

250
00:16:18,625 --> 00:16:20,292
Rock Turtle!

251
00:16:21,917 --> 00:16:23,542
Feveroot!

252
00:16:24,792 --> 00:16:26,250
Suiten!

253
00:16:27,542 --> 00:16:28,667
Mr. Ronandt.

254
00:16:28,667 --> 00:16:32,875
Although they're very strong monsters, I don't know if they could come in handy.

255
00:16:32,875 --> 00:16:35,167
Please prepare to teleport quickly.

256
00:16:37,333 --> 00:16:39,417
Again?

257
00:16:39,417 --> 00:16:41,917
Spiders should attack with venom, right?

258
00:16:41,917 --> 00:16:44,208
Abominable! I don't know.

259
00:16:44,208 --> 00:16:45,458
Charge!

260
00:16:46,667 --> 00:16:48,000
Kirekock!

261
00:16:57,583 --> 00:16:58,958
Suiten!

262
00:17:03,667 --> 00:17:05,083
It's not done yet.

263
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,333
Feveroot!

264
00:17:11,916 --> 00:17:14,249
Good. Aim the back of its neck.

265
00:17:20,375 --> 00:17:21,833
What? What happened?

266
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:23,667
There's no way. Run!

267
00:17:28,625 --> 00:17:31,208
That's the Magic of Wind, like Kirekock's.

268
00:17:31,208 --> 00:17:32,125
How is it possible?

269
00:17:32,125 --> 00:17:36,000
It can cast magic from nothing without using skills.

270
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:41,125
Rock Turtle!

271
00:17:42,458 --> 00:17:44,750
Rock Turtle, what happened to you?

272
00:17:45,458 --> 00:17:47,375
What?

273
00:18:02,583 --> 00:18:04,792
Just a little more.

274
00:18:10,875 --> 00:18:14,167
How did this happen?

275
00:18:14,167 --> 00:18:16,875
Mr. Ronandt, at least you must live. Go!

276
00:18:16,875 --> 00:18:20,083
Stop the nonsense. You must come back with me.

277
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,000
Mr. Ronandt.

278
00:18:51,583 --> 00:18:52,917
Mr. Ronandt.

279
00:18:52,917 --> 00:18:54,667
Mr. Buirimus.

280
00:18:54,667 --> 00:18:56,500
We're still in danger.

281
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:59,625
Call upon the person who knows Healing Magic.

282
00:18:59,625 --> 00:19:00,625
Roger.

283
00:19:03,458 --> 00:19:05,292
Where is the discovery team?

284
00:19:05,292 --> 00:19:07,458
They're all gone.

285
00:19:11,333 --> 00:19:14,875
Mr. Ronandt.

286
00:19:15,792 --> 00:19:17,542
Stay strong.

287
00:19:17,542 --> 00:19:20,083
You have to see your child.

288
00:19:20,083 --> 00:19:21,500
Thank you.

289
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:29,542
Because of you I could survive.

290
00:19:37,417 --> 00:19:42,375
The so-called strongest wizard of the mankind.

291
00:19:42,375 --> 00:19:44,833
I couldn't do anything at all.

292
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:46,750
Mr. Ronandt.

293
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:48,625
In this world,

294
00:19:48,625 --> 00:19:54,792
there are torrents that can't be stopped by human.

295
00:19:54,792 --> 00:19:58,083
Something big is about to happen.

296
00:19:58,083 --> 00:20:00,792
The Nightmare of the Labyrinth

297
00:20:00,792 --> 00:20:03,667
appeared at Kusorion Fortress.

298
00:20:03,667 --> 00:20:07,208
The Queen Taratect who's also one of the taratects.

299
00:20:09,417 --> 00:20:12,667
What does that person want again?

300
00:20:22,042 --> 00:20:23,292
Do you know? This is the prelude.

301
00:20:23,292 --> 00:20:25,583
The life of a spider.

302
00:20:25,583 --> 00:20:27,167
I'm going to start singing.

♫Just go on if there's no other way♫

336
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:27,458
♫Use all kind of skills♫

337
00:21:27,458 --> 00:21:29,958
♫I don't care even if I'm destroyed♫

338
00:21:29,958 --> 00:21:31,208
♫I don't want to die♫

339
00:21:31,208 --> 00:21:32,458
♫I want to live♫

340
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:33,708
♫I must keep living♫

341
00:21:33,708 --> 00:21:35,042

♫I don't want horrible game life♫

343
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:37,583
♫Life should be better after reincarnation♫

344
00:21:37,583 --> 00:21:38,875
♫Why is my beginning so miserable?♫

345
00:21:38,875 --> 00:21:40,083
♫I will not forgive you, admin D♫

346
00:21:40,083 --> 00:21:41,250
♫The big labyrinth is just as dark today♫

347
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:42,417
♫Keep living or die trying♫

348
00:21:42,417 --> 00:21:43,667
♫Although this kind of life is quite interesting♫

349
00:21:43,667 --> 00:21:45,417
♫I still can't accept why♫

350
00:21:45,417 --> 00:21:48,292
♫I am a spider♫

351
00:21:49,667 --> 00:21:50,625
I'm so angry!

352
00:21:50,625 --> 00:21:52,292
I'm really angry!

353
00:21:52,292 --> 00:21:55,125
So what? How can this be?

354
00:21:55,125 --> 00:21:56,708
This is annoying!

355
00:21:56,708 --> 00:21:59,167
How dare they break into my house and set fire

356
00:21:59,167 --> 00:22:03,417
while I was out hunting!

357
00:22:03,417 --> 00:22:07,083
And when I was trying to file a complaint, they attacked me.

358
00:22:07,083 --> 00:22:10,333
This is burglary!

359
00:22:10,333 --> 00:22:12,125
Yes!

360
00:22:12,125 --> 00:22:15,333
That was a justifiable defense, right?

361
00:22:15,333 --> 00:22:17,000
Yes!

362
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,500
I've marked those who escaped.

363
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:23,375
Marked?

364
00:22:24,083 --> 00:22:26,375
That's one of the abilities of Wisdom.

365
00:22:26,375 --> 00:22:28,292
Wisdom is powerful!

366
00:22:28,292 --> 00:22:32,875
Anyway, it won't be long until I know the exit of the labyrinth.

367
00:22:32,875 --> 00:22:35,417
Experience achieved a certain target.

368
00:22:35,417 --> 00:22:37,292
Level upgraded to level 20.

369
00:22:37,292 --> 00:22:38,083
Hooray!

370
00:22:38,083 --> 00:22:41,417
Various basic ability values have been upgraded.

371
00:22:41,417 --> 00:22:45,500
Upgrade of proficiency skill is rewarded.

372
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:49,917
Breathless endurance skill upgraded to level four.

373
00:22:49,917 --> 00:22:52,792
Skill points obtained.

374
00:22:52,792 --> 00:22:54,792
Conditions fulfilled.

375
00:22:54,792 --> 00:22:56,417
The Sickle of Death

376
00:22:56,417 --> 00:22:59,458
may evolve to Ede Saine.

377
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:03,667
Ede Saine?

378
00:23:03,667 --> 00:23:05,042
You're noisy.

379
00:23:05,042 --> 00:23:06,750
Sorry.

380
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:08,583
Nice rhyme...

381
00:23:09,375 --> 00:23:11,125
The symbol of death.

382
00:23:12,125 --> 00:23:15,083
It's starting to feel like Devil.

383
00:23:15,083 --> 00:23:17,000
Do you want to evolve?

384
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,833
Of course!

385
00:23:18,833 --> 00:23:22,667
Ede Saine, evolution begins.

386
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:26,750
Forbidden skill is upgraded to level ten.

387
00:23:27,708 --> 00:23:28,833
Oh no.

388
00:23:28,833 --> 00:23:33,750
The forbidden skill is at its highest level...

389
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:36,333
Loading message.

390
00:23:36,333 --> 00:23:39,000
SO I'M A SPIDER, SO WHAT? NEXT EPISODE: FINAL BATTLE
