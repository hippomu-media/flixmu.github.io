1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:01,792
Report.

2
00:00:01,792 --> 00:00:06,167
The fourth, eight and tenth legions
are ready for the expedition.

3
00:00:06,167 --> 00:00:10,292
Thank you.
The Major Legion also seems to be prepared.

4
00:00:10,833 --> 00:00:12,875
May I ask you something?

5
00:00:12,875 --> 00:00:14,292
What is it?

6
00:00:14,292 --> 00:00:19,542
During the march, our army will
pass by the territory of Queen Taratect.

7
00:00:19,542 --> 00:00:22,250
She is my family.

8
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:36,125
All taratects listen to my order,
so don't worry. Hurry up.

9
00:00:36,125 --> 00:00:37,500
Roger.

10
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:41,375
Only in the past they didn't listen to me.

11
00:00:42,458 --> 00:00:44,792
Okay, depart.

12
00:00:44,792 --> 00:00:48,583
Next, we will have to conquer the Elf Village.

13
00:00:55,083 --> 00:00:58,000
Living is awesome.

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,167
♫The alarm goes off. My name is Little Spider♫

36
00:02:29,208 --> 00:02:32,458
Very good.
The trace of monsters has disappeared.

37
00:02:34,083 --> 00:02:36,208
No one is injured, right?

38
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,167
No.

39
00:02:40,833 --> 00:02:44,375
To be honest, I didn't expect
to encounter so many monsters.

40
00:02:44,375 --> 00:02:49,917
What a solemn atmosphere.
This place is wide, yet it feels so enclosed.

41
00:02:49,917 --> 00:02:53,792
Besides, the monsters appear suddenly.
That's not good for our hearts.

42
00:02:54,667 --> 00:02:57,000
Uncle, let's keep going.

43
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,667
No. Let's just spend our night here.

44
00:03:00,667 --> 00:03:02,208
What are you talking about?

45
00:03:02,208 --> 00:03:05,542
Didn't we just enter the labyrinth not long ago?

46
00:03:05,542 --> 00:03:10,583
We can go on.
Besides, the monsters weren't so strong.

47
00:03:12,583 --> 00:03:16,333
We've entered the labyrinth
for more than five hours.

48
00:03:17,208 --> 00:03:20,292
I've guided many explorers in here.

49
00:03:20,292 --> 00:03:23,667
This is my first time
reaching this point so quickly.

50
00:03:23,667 --> 00:03:27,875
This means all your levels are very high.

51
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:32,750
But monsters are not
the only scary thing in the labyrinth,

52
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:34,625
there's also labyrinth syndrome.

53
00:03:34,625 --> 00:03:36,333
Labyrinth syndrome?

54
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:40,458
There's no sunlight at all here.

55
00:03:40,458 --> 00:03:45,208
We will have a false sense of time,
being constantly alert of monsters

56
00:03:45,208 --> 00:03:47,458
and have an enclosed feeling.

57
00:03:48,333 --> 00:03:53,125
The more anxious you are,
the easier you get tired, leading to collapse.

58
00:03:53,125 --> 00:03:55,333
This is labyrinth syndrome.

59
00:03:55,333 --> 00:03:57,042
Never be anxious.

60
00:03:57,042 --> 00:04:02,042
If you want to go through this labyrinth alive,
you have to be steady.

61
00:04:07,375 --> 00:04:08,917
Shun.

62
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:12,125
I get it.

63
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:20,874
Where is this?

64
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:25,000
Who is that?

65
00:04:26,458 --> 00:04:36,958
Proficiency achieved a certain level.

66
00:04:37,458 --> 00:04:38,958
It's suffering.

67
00:04:43,708 --> 00:04:45,083
A dream.

68
00:04:46,625 --> 00:04:49,125
Are you alright?

69
00:04:49,125 --> 00:04:50,292
Teacher.

70
00:04:50,292 --> 00:04:53,333
You look like you were groaning.

71
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:58,083
I'm fine. It was just a nightmare.

72
00:04:58,083 --> 00:05:00,875
What a bad omen.

73
00:05:00,875 --> 00:05:03,000
Is that bad?

74
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,125
Indeed. Do you know about
the legend of the Labyrinth's Nightmare?

75
00:05:07,125 --> 00:05:08,333
No.

76
00:05:08,333 --> 00:05:14,792
I remember it was about the legendary monster
in the labyrinth from more than 10 years ago.

77
00:05:14,792 --> 00:05:17,083
Legendary?

78
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:22,417
Is that the dangerous S-level monster
that human can't deal with?

79
00:05:22,417 --> 00:05:26,292
Yes. She's called the Queen,
who goes hand-in-hand with the Queen Taratect.

80
00:05:26,292 --> 00:05:29,292
The living disaster
of the Great Elroe Labyrinth.

81
00:05:29,292 --> 00:05:34,333
If it appears in a dream,
it might be an omen of a nightmare coming true.

82
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:38,708
But isn't the monster dead?

83
00:05:38,708 --> 00:05:41,083
That's what the people think.

84
00:05:41,083 --> 00:05:45,000
But I don't think that monster
can be defeated so easily.

85
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,083
It sounds like you've seen it.

86
00:05:48,083 --> 00:05:53,625
Yes. To be honest, I'm actually
the first to discover the Nightmare.

87
00:05:53,625 --> 00:05:56,958
You're really great.

88
00:05:56,958 --> 00:06:00,333
I can't forget the scene up until now.

89
00:06:00,333 --> 00:06:04,625
When I had eye-contact with it,
I didn't think I could survive.

90
00:06:06,792 --> 00:06:09,000
You could still come back alive.

91
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,750
Yes. The Nightmare has a strange habit.

92
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:15,292
As long as we didn't attack it first,
it would let us live.

93
00:06:15,292 --> 00:06:18,667
Not only that, it would also heal our wounds.

94
00:06:18,667 --> 00:06:19,750
What?

95
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:25,958
It even caused an uproar outside the labyrinth.
When it was in the mood, it would help others.

96
00:06:25,958 --> 00:06:29,542
A mysterious monster
whose behaviour can't be understood.

97
00:06:29,542 --> 00:06:32,167
Is that really a monster?

98
00:06:32,167 --> 00:06:37,458
There's only one thing we can be sure about
the Nightmare, it is unbelievably powerful.

99
00:06:37,458 --> 00:06:41,250
Of course all of you are powerful as well,
but there's always someone stronger.

100
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:46,167
There are always opponents
that you can't defeat. Remember that.

101
00:06:48,667 --> 00:06:52,542
I know very well that
there are always people who are stronger.

102
00:06:52,542 --> 00:06:55,292
Even so I have to do this.

103
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:58,500
Really?

104
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:01,667
Just work hard without dying then.

105
00:07:01,667 --> 00:07:05,458
Human may instantly die
even while facing something small.

106
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:09,167
Die from working too hard is
like putting the cart before the horse.

107
00:07:09,917 --> 00:07:13,125
Escaping from an opponent
you can't defeat isn't shameful.

108
00:07:13,125 --> 00:07:18,083
When you can't defeat an opponent, just run
and fight it again after you become stronger.

109
00:07:18,083 --> 00:07:25,042
What if it's an inescapable fight
that involves the fate of many?

110
00:07:25,042 --> 00:07:28,292
What if one is forced to
take this important responsibility?

111
00:07:28,292 --> 00:07:31,625
Just forget about it and run.

112
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:38,875
If someone scolds you for wanting to survive,
ask him to fight.

113
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:45,000
If you insist on doing it,
others have no right to comment.

114
00:07:46,208 --> 00:07:51,708
After all,
the most important thing is your decision.

115
00:07:53,875 --> 00:07:56,792
Mr. Basgath, thank you for your advice.

116
00:07:56,792 --> 00:08:00,417
But I have no way to escape.

117
00:08:00,417 --> 00:08:02,333
Because I'm the Warrior.

118
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:06,208
Really? Up to you then.

119
00:08:06,208 --> 00:08:09,083
Okay. It's about time to go.

120
00:08:09,083 --> 00:08:10,750
Hey, wake up.

121
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:14,625
We're departing soon.
I will leave you behind if you're slow.

122
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:18,375
It's your own decision?

123
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:22,250
There are a few routes ahead.

124
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:25,083
The shortest and dangerous route.

125
00:08:25,083 --> 00:08:27,875
The safer and longer route.

126
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:31,792
The unknown and unpredictable route.

127
00:08:31,792 --> 00:08:33,250
Which route do you want to choose?

128
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:36,417
How dangerous is the shortest, dangerous route?

129
00:08:36,417 --> 00:08:38,582
Although the road is as wide as a room,

130
00:08:38,582 --> 00:08:42,957
the monsters inhabit there are even stronger.

131
00:08:45,375 --> 00:08:47,542
-The monsters there are of dragon's level.
-Everyone is so great.

132
00:08:47,542 --> 00:08:49,875
-The monsters there are of dragon's level.
-You have no sympathy.

133
00:08:49,875 --> 00:08:52,125
What about the safe, far route?

134
00:08:52,125 --> 00:08:55,250
How far is the difference
from the shortest route?

135
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:57,833
About four days difference.

136
00:08:57,833 --> 00:09:00,292
That's far.

137
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:03,833
Here you go.

138
00:09:03,833 --> 00:09:05,625
Thank you.

139
00:09:05,625 --> 00:09:07,000
What about the last route?

140
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,792
That route...

141
00:09:08,792 --> 00:09:11,583
To be honest, that's the route
I'm most reluctant to take.

142
00:09:11,583 --> 00:09:14,125
You're being too honest.

143
00:09:14,125 --> 00:09:18,875
Because that's the territory
the Nightmare used to occupy.

144
00:09:18,875 --> 00:09:23,625
Although it's no longer there,
there's the Residue of the Nightmare.

145
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:27,333
Residue? Is the monster powerful?

146
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:30,000
Very powerful and tricky.

147
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,917
Just like the Nightmare,
as long as we don't attack it, it won't hurt us.

148
00:09:34,917 --> 00:09:38,958
However, there are invisible silks everywhere.

149
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:42,458
If you try to cut them off,
it will start attacking.

150
00:09:42,458 --> 00:09:44,042
Silks?

151
00:09:44,042 --> 00:09:45,792
Yes.

152
00:09:45,792 --> 00:09:50,500
The Nightmare is a taratect, so is the Residue of the Nightmare.

153
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:54,583
The invisible silks have
very strong viscosity and toughness.

154
00:09:54,583 --> 00:09:58,083
One can't get off easily once trapped.

155
00:09:58,083 --> 00:10:01,292
It was a common sense
to burn off a spider's nest.

156
00:10:01,292 --> 00:10:06,000
When you see a spider's nest now, run.

157
00:10:07,292 --> 00:10:09,958
It's better not to take this route.

158
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:15,833
Julius and I came to pursue
the Residue of the Nightmare once.

159
00:10:15,833 --> 00:10:19,000
We couldn't be sure if we could defeat it.

160
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Even Brother Julius...

161
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,083
What should we do?

162
00:10:22,083 --> 00:10:25,750
The last route is out of question.

163
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,917
Take the shortest route.

164
00:10:27,917 --> 00:10:29,000
Are you sure?

165
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,417
Yes.

166
00:10:32,167 --> 00:10:34,292
Please take us to the shortest route.

167
00:10:38,833 --> 00:10:42,917
The shortest route begins here. Be alert.

168
00:10:51,917 --> 00:10:53,375
What's going on?

169
00:10:53,375 --> 00:10:56,917
It's abnormal. There's no trace of monsters.

170
00:10:56,917 --> 00:11:00,083
Just like the time when I met the Nightmare.

171
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:03,708
Everyone, stay away!

172
00:11:08,708 --> 00:11:10,292
It's an earth dragon!

173
00:11:10,292 --> 00:11:13,417
Being at the Upper Stratum
means it just evolved.

174
00:11:14,667 --> 00:11:19,083
Speed 3600. Everyone, it's fast.

175
00:11:25,667 --> 00:11:27,125
Very hard.

176
00:11:39,458 --> 00:11:43,875
It's the skill of reversed scales.
It doesn't seem to be hurt by magic.

177
00:11:44,542 --> 00:11:46,000
If that's the case...

178
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:54,000
It can resist lightning, that's useless.
So is earth.

179
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,792
Let's try other attributes.

180
00:11:55,792 --> 00:11:57,750
Katia, contain it with magic.

181
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:59,458
Mr. Basgath, you too.

182
00:11:59,458 --> 00:12:01,417
Okay, leave it to me.

183
00:12:04,375 --> 00:12:07,792
Magic is useless.
Its defense is very strong as well.

184
00:12:07,792 --> 00:12:12,000
We need to use physical attack
to reduce its HP value.

185
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,042
Are you serious?

186
00:12:34,333 --> 00:12:36,208
The skill of steel body?

187
00:12:36,208 --> 00:12:38,167
That's cheating.

188
00:12:38,167 --> 00:12:40,750
Now! Teacher, Katia.

189
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:42,208
Got it.

190
00:12:51,417 --> 00:12:52,667
It's coming.

191
00:12:54,375 --> 00:12:56,042
Hey, young man.

192
00:12:56,042 --> 00:12:57,792
Mr. Schlain.

193
00:13:00,458 --> 00:13:02,292
Holy beam!

194
00:13:12,042 --> 00:13:14,375
Experience achieved a certain target.

195
00:13:14,375 --> 00:13:18,292
Schlain Zagan Analeit.
Level upgraded to level 29.

196
00:13:18,292 --> 00:13:21,292
The title "Dragon Slayer" is obtained.

197
00:13:21,292 --> 00:13:29,167
Due to the effect of the title, level-one
Destiny and level-one Dragon's Power obtained.

198
00:13:29,917 --> 00:13:31,625
Dragon Slayer?

199
00:13:31,625 --> 00:13:35,125
That means we're also becoming the legend.

200
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:38,750
Is it possible that everyone got this title?

201
00:13:40,208 --> 00:13:44,667
I don't know what to do all of a sudden.

202
00:13:44,667 --> 00:13:48,042
Fortunately, its level is very low.

203
00:13:48,042 --> 00:13:53,125
Dragon Slayer.
Even Julius didn't get this title.

204
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:56,542
I could finally show off
something to him when I die.

205
00:13:56,542 --> 00:13:59,167
Well done.

206
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:01,208
Stop it.

207
00:14:07,833 --> 00:14:09,583
The Residue of the Nightmare.

208
00:14:11,208 --> 00:14:14,333
Warrior...

209
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:20,458
The ruler...

210
00:14:20,458 --> 00:14:28,333
Identification failed...

211
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:34,125
Reincarnation...

212
00:14:34,125 --> 00:14:35,333
But very weak.

213
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:37,583
-Very weak...
-What's wrong with them?

214
00:14:37,583 --> 00:14:41,833
Very weak...

215
00:14:41,833 --> 00:14:43,208
Do you know about the reincarnation?

216
00:14:43,208 --> 00:14:44,375
Very weak.

217
00:14:44,375 --> 00:14:46,625
Yes...

218
00:14:46,625 --> 00:14:47,833
How can I not know it?

219
00:14:47,833 --> 00:14:48,833
Yes.

220
00:14:48,833 --> 00:14:50,500
Why do you know about this?

221
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,250
Master...

222
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:53,000
Mother.

223
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,042
Is your master a reincarnation?

224
00:14:55,042 --> 00:14:57,833
You will know when the time comes.

225
00:14:57,833 --> 00:14:58,958
You will know soon.

226
00:14:58,958 --> 00:14:59,500
You will understand soon.

227
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,625
Declaration.

228
00:15:01,625 --> 00:15:03,208
The beginning of the end.

229
00:15:03,208 --> 00:15:04,625
The world begins.

230
00:15:04,625 --> 00:15:06,208
The world ends.

231
00:15:06,208 --> 00:15:08,042
Hold on. What does that mean?

232
00:15:08,042 --> 00:15:09,375
There's no point knowing.

233
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:10,583
You will die after all.

234
00:15:10,583 --> 00:15:11,833
Everyone will die.

235
00:15:11,833 --> 00:15:13,417
Just struggle to live.

236
00:15:20,958 --> 00:15:22,542
You, silly.

237
00:15:22,542 --> 00:15:23,958
Master Basgath.

238
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:25,667
I told you.

239
00:15:25,667 --> 00:15:30,375
When you encounter the Residue
of the Nightmare, don't do anything recklessly.

240
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:35,458
Sorry. But I had to find out.

241
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:39,167
Even if you die?

242
00:15:42,167 --> 00:15:47,708
It's okay if you want to die.
But please do it alone.

243
00:15:47,708 --> 00:15:50,708
Mr. Basgath, you've gone too far.

244
00:15:52,625 --> 00:15:55,208
Isn't it great to be alive?

245
00:15:55,208 --> 00:16:00,042
It would be okay if there was just one.
We would be dead if so many attacked as once.

246
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:01,292
Sorry.

247
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:07,583
The beginning of the ending. Will everyone die?

248
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,083
What?

249
00:16:39,125 --> 00:16:41,083
What's wrong with you?

250
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:42,500
Nothing.

251
00:16:44,708 --> 00:16:48,292
Ever since we're here,
I've been dreaming odd things.

252
00:16:48,292 --> 00:16:51,500
I've not been dreaming about
the previous life for a long while.

253
00:16:53,375 --> 00:16:55,958
Why am I dreaming about Rihoko?

254
00:17:01,292 --> 00:17:03,583
What a big hole.

255
00:17:03,583 --> 00:17:07,041
This is dug by the Queen Taratect,
who was known as

256
00:17:07,041 --> 00:17:09,707
the Master of the Labyrinth.

257
00:17:09,708 --> 00:17:15,500
This cave is now being occupied
by the monsters called Finjicotes.

258
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:18,083
There are only a couple of them.
Although they're not so powerful,

259
00:17:18,083 --> 00:17:21,458
we have to fight them while climbing the cliff.

260
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:24,833
Hence we can't use that as the entrance.

261
00:17:24,833 --> 00:17:27,500
However, it's not the same this time.

262
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,375
That's it. We will leave it to you.

263
00:17:29,375 --> 00:17:31,083
Just leave it to me.

264
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:33,292
But first of all...

265
00:17:37,292 --> 00:17:41,042
Don't look back and don't eavesdrop.

266
00:17:41,042 --> 00:17:43,125
I get it.

267
00:17:43,125 --> 00:17:46,083
Sorry for the wait. Come up.

268
00:17:58,167 --> 00:17:59,833
Shun, what's going on?

269
00:18:00,625 --> 00:18:04,875
No. I'm just thinking,
I'm riding on a girl's back.

270
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:09,208
Don't have weird thoughts.
Please be clear about the situation.

271
00:18:09,208 --> 00:18:11,542
No. I wasn't joking.

272
00:18:11,542 --> 00:18:14,917
Can you stop flirting on my back?

273
00:18:14,917 --> 00:18:16,542
Beware that I may let you fall.

274
00:18:16,542 --> 00:18:18,083
Sorry.

275
00:18:18,083 --> 00:18:20,583
They're so annoying.

276
00:18:22,542 --> 00:18:25,417
I'm charging out. Hold tight.

277
00:18:41,208 --> 00:18:44,500
This is the Kasanagara Continent.

278
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:48,250
The Elf Village is just ahead.

279
00:18:54,458 --> 00:19:00,375
Oh my. If it weren't for the immortality
and auto-recovery of HP value, I would be dead.

280
00:19:00,375 --> 00:19:05,375
Besides, auto-recovery can't regrow my body.

281
00:19:05,375 --> 00:19:09,792
In Isekai, I'm fortunate to have them.
Immortality and auto-recovery.

282
00:19:09,792 --> 00:19:11,458
Word count exceeded.

283
00:19:12,375 --> 00:19:19,708
Head recovery alone requires much time.
I wonder how much time I need to recover fully.

284
00:19:21,583 --> 00:19:23,167
Yes. Dark Magic.

285
00:19:24,667 --> 00:19:28,292
Fortunately I can
still use magic in such a condition.

286
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:31,875
That means, I could use healing magic
to recover my body.

287
00:19:31,875 --> 00:19:38,583
But it requires a long time.
Besides, I may die if my MP value is used up.

288
00:19:38,583 --> 00:19:43,417
Even if my body recovers,
when that creature appears again...

289
00:19:45,583 --> 00:19:49,708
I worked so hard to leave Great Elroe Labyrinth,
yet mother attacked me.

290
00:19:49,708 --> 00:19:53,667
I finally found a way to deal with her,
then came the Devil King.

291
00:19:53,667 --> 00:19:54,792
Why am I so unfortunate?

292
00:19:54,792 --> 00:19:58,125
Besides, why did Devil King want to kill me?

293
00:19:58,125 --> 00:20:03,125
No, I know the reason.
Because Devil King is the Origin Taratect.

294
00:20:03,125 --> 00:20:04,542
Since she's called the Origin,

295
00:20:04,542 --> 00:20:07,792
she must be the highest-level taratect
that even mother has to obey to.

296
00:20:07,792 --> 00:20:11,292
She listened to mother's
assistance order and dispatched.

297
00:20:11,292 --> 00:20:14,250
Mother, the control freak.
How could she do that?

298
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:21,250
Forget it. I should be grateful
that Devil King didn't use Abyss Magic on me.

299
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:23,708
Maybe she did. Abyss Magic...

300
00:20:24,708 --> 00:20:28,250
The hidden effect of Abyss Magic
is soul decomposition.

301
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:31,875
It's the Ultimate Execution Magic
that can destroy even souls.

302
00:20:31,875 --> 00:20:34,458
When she uses that...

303
00:20:34,458 --> 00:20:35,958
IMMORTAL, SO WHAT?

304
00:20:35,958 --> 00:20:37,917
Immortal, so what?

305
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:41,583
That's not good.

306
00:20:41,583 --> 00:20:45,250
If she knows I'm still alive, I will be dead.

307
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:50,250
I can't count on immortality.
I need to come up with a strategy.

308
00:20:53,167 --> 00:20:57,542
Even if my soul is destroyed,
I have to find a way to survive.

309
00:20:57,542 --> 00:21:04,792
For example, reincarnate as a spider
so my soul can be transferred to that body.

310
00:21:04,792 --> 00:21:09,083
Parallel wills could be transferred to mother.
So...

311
00:21:09,083 --> 00:21:13,625
By the way,
are things going well with my parallel wills?

312
00:21:37,167 --> 00:21:40,625

What's with that fellow?

330
00:22:50,708 --> 00:22:54,583
I have killed her, yet the attack didn't stop.

331
00:22:58,042 --> 00:23:02,458
Could she have survived my attack?

332
00:23:04,417 --> 00:23:05,708
Body.

333
00:23:13,083 --> 00:23:16,583
The soul-invading attack
that can hardly be done with skills.

334
00:23:16,583 --> 00:23:20,542
Not only that, she even sneaked into my body.

335
00:23:20,542 --> 00:23:22,667
What a shameless one.

336
00:23:24,792 --> 00:23:26,625
I can't get rid of her.

337
00:23:26,625 --> 00:23:28,125
I must kill her.

338
00:23:28,125 --> 00:23:33,542
No matter what, I have to kill her body!

339
00:23:36,333 --> 00:23:39,000
SO I'M A SPIDER, SO WHAT?
NEXT EPISODE: EVERYONE IS SCHEMING.

340
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,458
STAY TUNED
