1
00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:04,750
This is Abyss Magic.

2
00:00:05,458 --> 00:00:08,042
Immortality can't help me against it.

3
00:00:08,042 --> 00:00:13,375
Oh no, I will surely die this time.

4
00:00:37,875 --> 00:00:42,083
To be honest, it's great to succeed.

5
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:44,500
With the egg-laying skill I got from mother,

6
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:47,292
I can produce inferior copies of myself.

7
00:00:47,292 --> 00:00:51,375
I thought, if I use it wisely,
I could transfer my parallel wills to them.

8
00:00:51,375 --> 00:00:53,500
It seems I was right.

9
00:00:54,458 --> 00:00:58,333
My body is immortal
and my soul can live on through these eggs.

10
00:00:58,333 --> 00:01:00,042
Both sides have indestructible existence.

11
00:01:00,042 --> 00:01:03,333
It's impossible to kill me.

12
00:01:06,167 --> 00:01:09,750
If I'm swallowed by Abyss Magic accidentally,
I may still die.

13
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:12,042
So I can't slack off.

14
00:01:12,667 --> 00:01:17,333
When I was attacking the army,
I thought I heard an evolution-announcement.

15
00:01:17,333 --> 00:01:18,750
ARACHNE

16
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:21,042
Finally...

17
00:01:22,708 --> 00:01:24,833
Although it's not a wonderful memory.

18
00:01:26,583 --> 00:01:29,667
Alright, come on. Evolve.

19
00:01:41,042 --> 00:01:44,208
♫The alarm goes off. My name is Little Spider♫

20
00:01:44,208 --> 00:01:46,625
"EPISODE 24: SO I'M STILL A SPIDER, SO WHAT?"
♫The awakening survival skill♫

21
00:01:46,625 --> 00:01:47,208
"EPISODE 24: SO I'M STILL A SPIDER, SO WHAT?"
♫No obstacles can stop me♫

22
00:01:47,208 --> 00:01:50,458
♫No obstacles can stop me♫

23
00:01:50,458 --> 00:01:52,000
♫Go! Dark clouds♫

24
00:02:02,917 --> 00:02:05,417
♫Sometimes I pretend it's fate♫

25
00:02:05,417 --> 00:02:08,167
♫The 3-D perspective street that
appears in the intersection of good and evil♫

26
00:02:08,167 --> 00:02:11,042
♫The labyrinth of nightmares is nothing to me♫

27
00:02:11,042 --> 00:02:13,792
♫Common sense isn't useful here♫

28
00:02:13,792 --> 00:02:18,875
♫Charging forward like a man is naive♫

29
00:02:18,875 --> 00:02:23,458
♫Because life isn't as easy as you think♫

30
00:02:23,458 --> 00:02:26,958
♫It drives me forward♫

31
00:02:26,958 --> 00:02:32,292
♫These hands created a brave me♫

00:02:32,292 --> 00:02:34,625
♫Excuse me, I'm the strongest!♫

33

♫So you can jump right

00:03:17,875 --> 00:03:19,417
Fire!

42
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,333
Kyouya.

43
00:03:37,208 --> 00:03:39,917
The power isn't so strong after all.

44
00:03:39,917 --> 00:03:43,083
At best,
it's like a chariot in the previous life.

45
00:03:43,875 --> 00:03:45,625
Okay. What should we do?

46
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:49,083
It seems magic and Sophia's blood
are useless against them.

47
00:03:49,083 --> 00:03:53,208
They're just metal plates. Nothing great.

48
00:03:53,208 --> 00:03:55,583
Show me your greatness then.

49
00:03:56,375 --> 00:03:58,125
Cover me.

50
00:03:58,125 --> 00:03:59,375
Okay.

51
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:04,292
-Hold...
-Fire again!

52
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:20,749
Full offense!

53
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:31,083
Stop!

54
00:04:31,083 --> 00:04:34,042
Look. Your friend is here.

55
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,750
Seriously?

56
00:04:42,167 --> 00:04:43,708
I won't let you have it, Shun.

57
00:04:43,708 --> 00:04:45,667
Why...

58
00:04:47,792 --> 00:04:49,042
Shun!

59
00:04:55,083 --> 00:04:57,667
What did you do to your best friend?

60
00:04:57,667 --> 00:05:01,542
Why did you ask me that?
Shun started attacking first.

61
00:05:01,542 --> 00:05:03,917
Attack!

62
00:05:04,833 --> 00:05:09,750
No matter how many times we attack,
they keep coming back like maggots.

63
00:05:17,667 --> 00:05:18,917
Alright.

64
00:05:20,458 --> 00:05:21,333
Shun.

65
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:23,583
Can the two of you go away?

66
00:05:24,792 --> 00:05:26,292
Katia. Fei.

67
00:05:26,792 --> 00:05:28,583
Kyouya!

68
00:05:31,167 --> 00:05:32,667
It's so light.

69
00:05:32,667 --> 00:05:36,083
Do you really think
such a weak sword can kill me?

70
00:05:37,042 --> 00:05:40,083
Sorry, Shun. I must let you sleep for now.

71
00:05:40,083 --> 00:05:41,167
No!

72
00:05:41,167 --> 00:05:42,417
Master Schlain!

73
00:05:45,125 --> 00:05:48,125
Anna.

74
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,833
Anna.

75
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:58,042
I didn't want to kill her.

76
00:05:58,042 --> 00:06:00,792
If you didn't come to defend him,
no one would die.

77
00:06:08,167 --> 00:06:10,625
We still can make it.

78
00:06:10,625 --> 00:06:15,708
Due to the use of Mercy,
proficiency achieved a certain target.

79
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:19,042
Forbidden skill upgraded to level 10.

80
00:06:23,208 --> 00:06:24,667
Great.

81
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:34,000
Condition fulfilled. Forbidden effect activated.

82
00:06:35,042 --> 00:06:37,958
Message being loaded.

83
00:06:37,958 --> 00:06:39,333
Loaded?

84
00:06:39,958 --> 00:06:44,667
ATONEMENT

85
00:06:45,625 --> 00:06:48,042
Loading completed.

86
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,833
Shun, come on!

87
00:06:57,875 --> 00:07:00,625
What did you do to Shun?

88
00:07:00,625 --> 00:07:02,708
What did you do?

89
00:07:02,708 --> 00:07:05,542
No. I didn't do anything.

90
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,917
Die!

91
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:27,458
Cursed you. Annoying Rihoko.

92
00:07:43,292 --> 00:07:46,625
Master, please don't disturb me, okay?

93
00:07:50,042 --> 00:07:53,583
How is this possible? Why?

94
00:07:54,458 --> 00:07:57,125
Long time no see, teacher.

95
00:07:58,667 --> 00:08:01,375
Wakaba.

96
00:08:11,208 --> 00:08:12,958
This is frightening.

97
00:08:12,958 --> 00:08:16,542
These values are unbeatable.

98
00:08:16,542 --> 00:08:19,042
Even Devil can't match this.

99
00:08:19,042 --> 00:08:23,250
But the main point isn't these ability values,
but this body.

100
00:08:29,667 --> 00:08:31,542
Besides,

101
00:08:35,457 --> 00:08:40,124
only by moving my neck, I can see a wide range.

102
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:42,958
It's weird.
I look like how I was in the previous life.

103
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:47,458
Everyone is born.

104
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:51,792
Would I be abandoning babies if I leave now?

105
00:08:52,583 --> 00:08:55,375
I should at least provide food like a mother.

106
00:08:56,208 --> 00:08:58,750
Alright, everyone. Work hard.

107
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:00,375
Goodbye.

108
00:09:00,375 --> 00:09:02,625
Okay. What should I do?

109
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:04,292
I forgot about it completely.

110
00:09:04,292 --> 00:09:07,500
I wonder how the city
of the vampire child is now.

111
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:11,125
She's far from the battlefield.
She should be alright.

112
00:09:11,125 --> 00:09:12,125
Clairvoyance.

113
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:15,333
It's on fire!

114
00:09:16,542 --> 00:09:18,375
The security in the town was too careless.

115
00:09:18,375 --> 00:09:21,875
Is it because most of the people
are sent to the battlefield?

116
00:09:22,625 --> 00:09:24,958
There's an elf in the room of the vampire child.

117
00:09:31,625 --> 00:09:33,875
How's the evacuation situation of the people?

118
00:09:33,875 --> 00:09:36,625
Sadly, the situation isn't too good.

119
00:09:37,625 --> 00:09:38,583
I see.

120
00:09:39,208 --> 00:09:42,708
Don't worry, Sophia.

121
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:47,208
Ohts and the rest are attacking
this town that lacks defense.

122
00:09:47,208 --> 00:09:49,458
We will be doomed if we don't figure a way out.

123
00:09:49,458 --> 00:09:53,667
But I'm a baby. I can do nothing.

124
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:56,625
Master, you should escape.

125
00:09:58,083 --> 00:10:02,667
There are still residents here.
How can the leader escape?

126
00:10:02,667 --> 00:10:04,125
Then I...

127
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:07,417
I will entrust my daughter, Sophia, to you.

128
00:10:08,667 --> 00:10:13,042
I want to entrust my daughter
to the most reliable person, you.

129
00:10:13,042 --> 00:10:15,208
I beg you too.

130
00:10:17,042 --> 00:10:20,083
I get it.

131
00:10:22,542 --> 00:10:23,917
Sophia.

132
00:10:23,917 --> 00:10:27,958
I really want to be by your side while you grow.

133
00:10:27,958 --> 00:10:30,708
Please forgive your useless father.

134
00:10:33,042 --> 00:10:36,250
Be happy and strong.

135
00:10:38,708 --> 00:10:41,458
Merazophis, thank you.

136
00:10:41,458 --> 00:10:45,875
I will protect her with my life.

137
00:10:49,833 --> 00:10:51,875
Go, Merazophis.

138
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:16,250
No one is here to save us.

139
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:18,125
We will surely die.

140
00:11:20,208 --> 00:11:22,542
Is this the end?

141
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,500
I must protect the young mistress.

142
00:11:27,625 --> 00:11:29,708
The only way to take a turn in this situation...

143
00:11:35,042 --> 00:11:36,917
Condition fulfilled.

144
00:11:36,917 --> 00:11:41,708
Level 1 Family Domination Skill obtained.

145
00:12:12,583 --> 00:12:14,500
How long do you want to play this game?

146
00:12:18,542 --> 00:12:21,000
What?

147
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,042
A vampire.

148
00:12:23,042 --> 00:12:28,750
Although your born ability value is low,
you may be tricky when you grow up.

149
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:30,500
This guy...

150
00:12:38,292 --> 00:12:40,958
A reincarnation baby.

151
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:42,458
What should we do with her?

152
00:12:42,458 --> 00:12:43,667
Kill her.

153
00:12:43,667 --> 00:12:47,458
Then tell Oka that she died in the war.

154
00:12:47,458 --> 00:12:51,333
If we let vampires live,
things will be troublesome.

155
00:12:51,333 --> 00:12:52,667
Understood.

156
00:12:54,375 --> 00:13:01,250
Don't do anything to the young mistress.

157
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:04,417
Why are you sacrificing yourself for this girl?

158
00:13:04,417 --> 00:13:08,167
She's a vampire
that will bring disaster to the world.

159
00:13:08,167 --> 00:13:10,458
That has nothing to do with me.

160
00:13:10,458 --> 00:13:15,083
I promised to protect her.

161
00:13:15,083 --> 00:13:16,792
Ridiculous.

162
00:13:21,208 --> 00:13:24,083
Teleport. Followed by...

163
00:13:25,667 --> 00:13:27,625
Hitting!

164
00:13:33,208 --> 00:13:35,167
Wakaba.

165
00:13:37,458 --> 00:13:40,167
Good timing. Let me show you my new Evil Eye.

166
00:13:40,167 --> 00:13:42,000
Distorting Evil Eye.

167
00:13:44,708 --> 00:13:46,833
It distorts the space.

168
00:13:46,833 --> 00:13:49,667
No incantation can escape from this Evil Eye.

169
00:13:49,667 --> 00:13:54,292
But if it's activated in such a place,
it can easily be avoided.

170
00:13:55,833 --> 00:13:58,208
You look like you're dying again.

171
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:06,667
Isn't she an enemy?

172
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:11,625
I didn't expect to
be interrupted by an odd creature.

173
00:14:11,625 --> 00:14:15,583
Even hitting him with my ability values
doesn't seem to be effective.

174
00:14:16,833 --> 00:14:20,167
Not only did he see through the ability values
of Devil, even Wisdom can't handle him.

175
00:14:20,167 --> 00:14:24,125
A taratect. Are you from Ariel?

176
00:14:24,125 --> 00:14:27,417
But I haven't seen such a creature before.

177
00:14:27,417 --> 00:14:29,625
What are you?

178
00:14:29,625 --> 00:14:34,583
It seems I'd better retreat with that two.

179
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:37,458
Dream on. Anti-Magic Barrier activated.

180
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,792
It's gone.

181
00:14:41,792 --> 00:14:46,250
Not only that,
even my activated skills have been canceled.

182
00:14:47,167 --> 00:14:49,458
Magic removal skill.

183
00:14:49,458 --> 00:14:52,000
Is it appropriate to have this skill?

184
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,208
My name is Potimas Harrifenas.

185
00:14:55,208 --> 00:14:58,250
I agree that you're qualified as my opponent.

186
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:03,667
Oh no.

187
00:15:03,667 --> 00:15:06,875
My body is heavy.
I can't move as freely as I want to.

188
00:15:06,875 --> 00:15:10,417
This barrier doesn't just dismiss magic.

189
00:15:10,417 --> 00:15:14,042
It invalids magic, skills and ability values.

190
00:15:16,792 --> 00:15:19,000
That was close.

191
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,750
I can't move my body so freely.

192
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:23,083
Even if I want to jump to the wall,
taking a step back is time consuming enough.

193
00:15:23,083 --> 00:15:25,708
I would be dead
if it weren't for the Hypervelocity Thinking.

194
00:15:25,708 --> 00:15:28,750
But Hypervelocity Thinking can actually be used.

195
00:15:31,542 --> 00:15:35,958
Does it mean the skills
that work internally can still be used?

196
00:15:35,958 --> 00:15:39,917
Besides, my ability values aren't entirely gone.

197
00:15:39,917 --> 00:15:43,583
Does it mean the internal skills
and ability values are still effective?

198
00:15:43,583 --> 00:15:45,458
That means I still can fight.

199
00:15:48,708 --> 00:15:50,958
Is he wearing a metal protective gear?

200
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:53,833
What's wrong with his body?

201
00:16:00,875 --> 00:16:03,250
Dodging will only bring death.

202
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:05,292
I must strike back.

203
00:16:09,458 --> 00:16:10,375
10 o'clock.

204
00:16:12,292 --> 00:16:15,625
Hey, where is this Terminator from?

205
00:16:17,458 --> 00:16:21,000
According to the forbidden intelligence,
this thing can't exist in this world.

206
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,542
Such mechanical skills
drive this world to the end.

207
00:16:24,542 --> 00:16:27,208
I must kill this guy here.

208
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:32,083
This is annoying.
Although I didn't want to use this,

209
00:16:32,083 --> 00:16:33,583
I have no other way.

210
00:16:35,458 --> 00:16:36,583
Oh no.

211
00:16:42,625 --> 00:16:44,958
I can't escape. I shall just...

212
00:16:52,333 --> 00:16:55,375
Take this!

213
00:16:59,042 --> 00:17:02,583
I have another head on my spider body.

214
00:17:02,583 --> 00:17:04,666
Even if the flesh is cut open,
the bone won't be separated.

215
00:17:04,666 --> 00:17:06,707
If you cut off my head,
only my head will be damaged.

216
00:17:06,708 --> 00:17:08,042
Equivalent exchange.

217
00:17:08,833 --> 00:17:10,708
So dangerous.

218
00:17:10,708 --> 00:17:14,625
If I ignore you,
there may be a lot of troubles in the future.

219
00:17:14,625 --> 00:17:18,166
I shall send you to death here.

220
00:17:18,166 --> 00:17:19,666
Oh no.

221
00:17:19,666 --> 00:17:23,291
Since I can't use my skills,
it's uncertain if my immortality is activated.

222
00:17:23,291 --> 00:17:27,499
I can't even revive using an egg
because they're all hatched.

223
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:42,417
If this goes on, I will lose.

224
00:17:42,417 --> 00:17:44,333
Is there a good way?

225
00:17:45,125 --> 00:17:46,625
Perhaps this could work.

226
00:17:46,625 --> 00:17:49,083
All Evil Eyes activated.

227
00:17:49,667 --> 00:17:51,417
It didn't work?

228
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:55,083
What?

229
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:57,458
Distorting Evil Eye was activated.

230
00:17:58,792 --> 00:18:03,750
Yes. It's effective because the internal space
of the right hand is distorted.

231
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,042
Very well.

232
00:18:08,167 --> 00:18:13,167
Because the space is cut,
I can escape with just a slight move.

233
00:18:15,042 --> 00:18:20,292
He can't kill me now, but I can kill him.

234
00:18:20,292 --> 00:18:23,125
If I can target Evil Eye on him, I will win.

235
00:18:23,125 --> 00:18:26,458
But in fist fight, Potimas will win.

236
00:18:36,458 --> 00:18:40,208
The grand debut of the Devil, Ariel.

237
00:18:40,958 --> 00:18:43,250
Devil, why are you here?

238
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:46,500
Besides, have you always been like this?

239
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,375
Ariel?

240
00:18:48,375 --> 00:18:50,125
Didn't I tell you it's me?

241
00:18:50,125 --> 00:18:51,958
No. Of course no one trusts that.

242
00:18:51,958 --> 00:18:52,917
Your personality is completely different.

243
00:18:52,917 --> 00:18:53,917
You should at least look at the occasion.

244
00:18:53,917 --> 00:18:55,542
We're in a battle.

245
00:18:55,542 --> 00:18:59,333
By the way, Potimas, why are you here?

246
00:18:59,333 --> 00:19:01,958
I don't know why either.

247
00:19:06,167 --> 00:19:07,500
Be honest.

248
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,000
It's so scary.

249
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,000
May I leave first?

250
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,042
Or do you want me to make you say it?

251
00:19:16,042 --> 00:19:17,500
I deny.

252
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:19,917
What a shame.

253
00:19:23,375 --> 00:19:27,083
Even this body can't defeat you?

254
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:31,083
One day, your original body
will face the same end.

255
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:34,750
Try it if you can, little rascal.

256
00:19:38,708 --> 00:19:40,833
Okay. The spider over there.

257
00:19:53,083 --> 00:19:54,708
Let's stop fighting.

258
00:19:55,917 --> 00:20:00,083
If Abyss Magic can't defeat you,
I have no winning chance.

259
00:20:00,083 --> 00:20:03,000
No. I can't revive with eggs now.
So if you attack with full force,

260
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
I will surely be dead.

261
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Besides, I've merged with
the previous person in charge of body.

262
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,750
To be honest,
I'm not interested in fighting you anymore.

263
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:18,042
Previous person in charge of body, thank you.

264
00:20:18,042 --> 00:20:21,000
So let's stop fighting. What do you think?

265
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,708
I of course agree.

266
00:20:22,708 --> 00:20:25,292
After all, I only stroke back
because you attacked me first.

267
00:20:25,292 --> 00:20:28,125
I have no reason to fight you.

268
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:35,458
I can finally live a life
where no one threatens my life.

269
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:48,208
I'm defeated by her.

270
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:56,750
The while spider girl, remember this,

271
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:59,083
I will kill you.

272
00:21:03,667 --> 00:21:08,042
I would like to suggest something.
Would you like to work with me?

273
00:21:08,042 --> 00:21:11,083
Although you're a scary enemy,

274
00:21:11,083 --> 00:21:15,042
you will make the best alliance.

275
00:21:15,042 --> 00:21:17,250
Work together to do what?

276
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:21,417
To kill the pest of the world,
Potimas' original body.

277
00:21:21,417 --> 00:21:25,125
Not just you, spider.
You two should come along too.

278
00:21:25,125 --> 00:21:28,292
Merazophis and Sophia.

279
00:21:28,292 --> 00:21:31,250
Thank you for saving us.

280
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:35,333
Who are the two of you?

281
00:21:35,333 --> 00:21:37,458
I'm Devil, Ariel.

282
00:21:37,458 --> 00:21:43,875
This is the evolved Mythical Beast
that you used to worship.

283
00:21:43,875 --> 00:21:46,875
Master Devil. Mythical Beast.

284
00:21:46,875 --> 00:21:51,333
It's tough for vampires to live unprotected.

285
00:21:51,333 --> 00:21:52,958
Come with us.

286
00:21:52,958 --> 00:21:56,083
Vampire? No wonder...

287
00:21:56,083 --> 00:21:59,125
Merazophis, sorry.

288
00:21:59,125 --> 00:22:00,375
Young mistress.

289
00:22:01,417 --> 00:22:04,458
I turned you into a vampire.

290
00:22:06,292 --> 00:22:10,250
Although I'm not thankful, I don't hate you.

291
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:14,000
Besides, this is perhaps
a better form to protect you.

292
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,125
But you're now a vampire.
You can no longer live as a human.

293
00:22:18,125 --> 00:22:19,667
I'm ready

294
00:22:19,667 --> 00:22:23,417
to protect you as long as I'm alive.

295
00:22:23,417 --> 00:22:25,250
Merazophis.

296
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:29,292
Alright then. Let's head
to the territory of Demon Clan together.

297
00:22:29,292 --> 00:22:34,042
Besides hiding from the elves, the demon's
territory is also good for a vampire's life.

298
00:22:34,042 --> 00:22:35,667
One stone hits two birds.

299
00:22:35,667 --> 00:22:38,292
Thankful for your care.

300
00:22:38,292 --> 00:22:41,125
Spider, you're coming as well, right?

301
00:22:41,125 --> 00:22:42,750
Through the battle, I found out

302
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:46,625
Potimas has the skills to destroy the world.

303
00:22:46,625 --> 00:22:50,083
If we want the extincting world to survive,

304
00:22:50,083 --> 00:22:53,375
we should find a way to kill that guy.

305
00:22:53,375 --> 00:22:57,542
As long as you're around,
we can surely kill that guy next time.

306
00:22:57,542 --> 00:23:01,917
In order to save the planet from destruction,
I hope you can help me.

307
00:23:01,917 --> 00:23:04,125
That sounds like a lofty ambition.

308
00:23:04,125 --> 00:23:07,500
If the planet is destroyed, I can't live either.

309
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:10,000
I shall make alliance for now.

310
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,083
I have to increase my power as well.

311
00:23:13,083 --> 00:23:16,375
Very well. The three of you,
let's help each other from now on.

312
00:23:16,375 --> 00:23:20,083
We shall be the heroes
that save this world together.

313
00:23:30,375 --> 00:23:35,000
But the title "heroes that save this world"...

314
00:23:39,375 --> 00:23:41,458
doesn't sound cool.
