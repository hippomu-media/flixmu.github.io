1
00:00:00,292 --> 00:00:03,833
Shun... We will be in charge
of suppressing the Warrior.

2
00:00:03,833 --> 00:00:05,667
Thank you.

3
00:00:05,667 --> 00:00:09,125
You may go kill that fellow, Lord Ariel.

4
00:00:09,125 --> 00:00:11,875
I shall depart then.

5
00:00:12,625 --> 00:00:16,333
Potimas, I'm coming to decapitate you.

6
00:00:27,208 --> 00:00:29,583
Lord Potimas, we found out that
behind the Imperial Army

7
00:00:29,583 --> 00:00:32,042
there's another army.

8
00:00:32,042 --> 00:00:36,625
I know.
The Imperial Army is only taking the lead.

9
00:00:36,625 --> 00:00:41,000
That means, you already know which army that is?

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,458
It's the Demon Legion.

11
00:00:42,458 --> 00:00:44,375
Demon Legion?

12
00:00:44,375 --> 00:00:49,000
Why would Demon Legion want to attack
an Elf Village in the human territory?

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,500
I don't know.

14
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:53,708
Should we send Warrior and
the reincarnations to the front line?

15
00:00:53,708 --> 00:00:55,500
Do whatever you want.

16
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,625
They're useless now.

17
00:00:57,625 --> 00:01:03,000
Instead of that, prepare to send that thing out.
Activate all of them.

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,167
All of them?
That seems a little too much, isn't it?

19
00:01:07,167 --> 00:01:13,542
If Demon Legion attacks,
we have to be fully prepared.

20
00:01:13,542 --> 00:01:15,542
No need to retain strength.

21
00:01:15,542 --> 00:01:17,083
I get it.

22
00:01:18,667 --> 00:01:21,167
This stubborn little girl.

23
00:01:22,083 --> 00:01:25,333
It's time to settle the old score between us.

24
00:01:26,375 --> 00:01:29,958
You think you can defeat me.
What a silly thought.

25
00:01:29,958 --> 00:01:32,833
I will correct you with death.

26
00:01:32,833 --> 00:01:34,792
Activate.

27
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,167
♫The alarm goes off. My name is Little Spider♫

28
00:01:40,167 --> 00:01:42,583
"EPISODE 23: MY OLD FRIEND, WHY...?"
♫The awakening survival skill♫

29
00:01:42,583 --> 00:01:43,167

♫No obstacles can stop me♫

30
00:01:43,167 --> 00:01:46,417

♫Sometimes I pretend it's fate♫

♫The 3-D perspective street that

00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,750
♫Common sense isn't useful here♫

36
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:14,833

37
00:02:14,833 --> 00:02:19,417

49
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:31,500
He has been showing an imposing manner
but he couldn't even hit Shun.

50
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:36,208
They're both Warriors, but the characters
of Shun and Hugo are very different.

51
00:03:46,708 --> 00:03:48,958
Do you want to keep fighting?

52
00:03:51,125 --> 00:03:52,583
There's no use.

53
00:03:53,625 --> 00:03:57,708
No use...

54
00:03:57,708 --> 00:04:01,833
Magic. I guess it's Cursing Magic.

55
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:04,583
There's no effect at all.

56
00:04:04,583 --> 00:04:11,708
It's not that Hugo's magic skill is too low,
but Shun's defensive ability is too high.

57
00:04:11,708 --> 00:04:19,000
Shun also got dragon power when he defeated
the earth dragon in Great Elroe Labyrinth.

58
00:04:21,416 --> 00:04:24,708
As long as he has the ability to weaken magic,

59
00:04:24,708 --> 00:04:27,458
Hugo can never hurt him.

60
00:04:27,458 --> 00:04:28,958
Give up.

61
00:04:28,958 --> 00:04:31,208
Cursed you.

62
00:04:35,833 --> 00:04:38,625
This is impossible! Impossible!

63
00:04:38,625 --> 00:04:41,250
He's not very good in using the sword either.

64
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:44,542
Cursed you.

65
00:04:46,417 --> 00:04:48,042
You!

66
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:54,042
How is this possible?

67
00:04:54,042 --> 00:04:56,500
This world belongs to me.

68
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:59,083
Why are you still thinking
about such silly things?

69
00:04:59,083 --> 00:05:06,708
This world doesn't belong to you.
It belongs to the people who live in this world.

70
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:10,792
Shun, well said.

71
00:05:10,792 --> 00:05:12,667
Rotter!

72
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,875
You're right.

73
00:05:17,833 --> 00:05:23,333
But it's funny to hear it from a person
who doesn't know the truth.

74
00:05:24,917 --> 00:05:28,708
Sophia, kill him!

75
00:05:28,708 --> 00:05:31,042
What should I do?

76
00:05:31,042 --> 00:05:33,583
Is this the time to fool around?

77
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:36,250
Didn't you told me

78
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:38,625
not to interrupt?

79
00:05:38,625 --> 00:05:40,667
You...

80
00:05:40,667 --> 00:05:45,750
Besides, you're useless now.

81
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:47,250
What?

82
00:05:48,125 --> 00:05:50,583
Merazophis, how is it?

83
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:54,917
Demon Legion is beginning to attack the village.

84
00:05:55,792 --> 00:05:58,792
It's going on successfully.

85
00:05:58,792 --> 00:06:01,292
Why is this guy...

86
00:06:01,292 --> 00:06:02,792
Do you know him?

87
00:06:02,792 --> 00:06:04,917
He's the cadre of Demon Legion.

88
00:06:04,917 --> 00:06:06,458
Demon Legion?

89
00:06:06,458 --> 00:06:08,458
He's even the cadre.

90
00:06:08,458 --> 00:06:12,750
Merazophis is the commander
of the Fourth Demon Legion.

91
00:06:13,333 --> 00:06:16,875
That means, you're also part of Demon Legion?

92
00:06:16,875 --> 00:06:18,583
Great observation.

93
00:06:18,583 --> 00:06:22,792
I get it now. Demon Legion
used Imperial Army as bait.

94
00:06:22,792 --> 00:06:24,167
They used Imperial Army to confuse us.

95
00:06:24,167 --> 00:06:28,042
Their true aim is to invade Elf Village.

96
00:06:29,458 --> 00:06:36,083
While the elves are fighting the Imperial Army,
the Demon Legion kills them.

97
00:06:36,083 --> 00:06:37,750
Could it be true?

98
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:41,542
You've been making used of me, Sophia?

99
00:06:41,542 --> 00:06:47,542
Where is this noisy little fly from?

100
00:06:47,542 --> 00:06:49,333
You...

101
00:06:50,167 --> 00:06:52,708
What should we do, Shun?

102
00:06:52,708 --> 00:06:54,667
I want to defeat her.

103
00:06:54,667 --> 00:06:57,792
You're very brave.

104
00:07:02,083 --> 00:07:04,208
Are you serious?

105
00:07:05,792 --> 00:07:09,375
Take that child away. She's disturbing me.

106
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:13,792
Hold on.

107
00:07:14,958 --> 00:07:18,792
You might have been able
to defeat the puppets easily.

108
00:07:18,792 --> 00:07:23,125
But you will suffer for thinking I'm like them.

109
00:07:23,125 --> 00:07:26,458
How dare you call me a puppet?

110
00:07:26,458 --> 00:07:30,000
Unforgivable! No matter who that is.

111
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,958
I want to shred all of you into pieces.

112
00:07:39,708 --> 00:07:41,750
Bring it on.

113
00:07:44,917 --> 00:07:46,417
I'm coming!

114
00:07:47,833 --> 00:07:49,917
Shun, no!

115
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:55,417
What?

116
00:07:55,417 --> 00:07:58,750
What a cute light. However...

117
00:08:01,583 --> 00:08:03,042
it's too weak.

118
00:08:03,708 --> 00:08:09,917
She has the same dragon power as Shun.
No, a more powerful magic nullification skill.

119
00:08:09,917 --> 00:08:14,167
You're not qualified even to play with me.

120
00:08:14,167 --> 00:08:16,792
Cursed you! It's not over!

121
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:22,542
Katia.

122
00:08:22,542 --> 00:08:25,625
You can't win fighting alone.

123
00:08:25,625 --> 00:08:29,000
Shun, I will fight with you too.

124
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,333
Guys...

125
00:08:30,333 --> 00:08:33,167
Shun, you're not alone.

126
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:40,875
What a big formation.

127
00:08:40,875 --> 00:08:47,000
I'm not alone. As long as
I'm fighting alongside my friends, I can win.

128
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,417
You can win by fighting alongside friends?

129
00:08:52,875 --> 00:08:56,125
Asaka and I will take down Merazophis.

130
00:08:56,125 --> 00:08:59,833
They said they will take you down. Be careful.

131
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:02,292
Thank you for your concern.

132
00:09:02,292 --> 00:09:04,583
You should be careful as well, Miss.

133
00:09:13,958 --> 00:09:18,583
Even if we're six to one,
we will not have mercy. Are you okay with it?

134
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:20,042
I don't care.

135
00:09:20,042 --> 00:09:23,542
It's okay even if you take more people along.

136
00:09:23,542 --> 00:09:25,833
You're very calm indeed.

137
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:28,125
Because there's nothing to be anxious about.

138
00:09:39,167 --> 00:09:39,708
Very well.

139
00:09:39,708 --> 00:09:40,917
Now is the time.

140
00:09:48,083 --> 00:09:49,417
Katia!

141
00:09:50,333 --> 00:09:52,708
You still don't understand.

142
00:09:53,792 --> 00:09:58,583
When I split teacher's arrow into two
just by a touch of my finger,

143
00:09:58,583 --> 00:10:01,792
it already proved the huge gap of our strength.

144
00:10:02,417 --> 00:10:07,333
Despite the strength difference,

145
00:10:08,542 --> 00:10:11,125
I can't quit this battle.

146
00:10:11,125 --> 00:10:13,417
That's very macho.

147
00:10:13,417 --> 00:10:15,833
Do you think you avoided that strike

148
00:10:15,833 --> 00:10:20,667
with your own power and luck?

149
00:10:20,667 --> 00:10:25,667
You're wrong.
I shot it to your sword intentionally.

150
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:31,750
It's harder to aim a weapon
which is smaller than your body.

151
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:34,375
Use this huge sword.

152
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:39,375
But Master told me not to kill reincarnations.

153
00:10:43,917 --> 00:10:49,625
I remember there's a mixed-elf here,
a creature that belongs to the grey zone.

154
00:10:57,542 --> 00:10:59,208
Very good, Shun.

155
00:10:59,208 --> 00:11:02,250
It's hard to attack quickly
with such a big sword.

156
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:05,708
You can suppress her by increasing the strikes.

157
00:11:05,708 --> 00:11:08,042
Your speed is very fast.

158
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:12,208
As I expected, she started defensive attack.

159
00:11:20,208 --> 00:11:21,708
There's a flaw.

160
00:11:27,625 --> 00:11:28,958
Are you alright?

161
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:32,167
Yes. Thank you.

162
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:39,208
Although your strategy is not bad,
your sword skill is too pure.

163
00:11:39,208 --> 00:11:42,917
Your sword skill and your thought are the same.

164
00:11:42,917 --> 00:11:47,417
That's why you can't handle
such a sudden attack.

165
00:11:47,417 --> 00:11:50,208
Our combat experience differs too much.

166
00:11:51,292 --> 00:11:52,500
Despite so...

167
00:11:57,833 --> 00:12:02,083
You said, as long as you have your friends,
you can defeat me, right?

168
00:12:02,083 --> 00:12:05,833
But I think the situation hasn't changed.

169
00:12:17,125 --> 00:12:21,125
It will be so relaxing and time-saving
if I can kill you.

170
00:12:21,125 --> 00:12:25,000
But I can't kill you,
even if you keep pestering.

171
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,958
It's even more time-consuming and annoying.

172
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:31,375
Why don't you kill reincarnations?

173
00:12:32,625 --> 00:12:35,250
Why don't you kill reincarnations?

174
00:12:36,125 --> 00:12:39,917
Because our ultimate goal is to kill the elves.

175
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:45,500
But I mean elves besides the teacher.

176
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:49,458
What should I do to the mixed-elf then?

177
00:12:49,458 --> 00:12:51,833
How powerful is the Demon Legion?

178
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:53,833
Did the white guy come?

179
00:12:53,833 --> 00:12:55,208
Do you care a lot?

180
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:56,750
Of course I do.

181
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:59,083
She's the one who killed Brother Julius.

182
00:12:59,083 --> 00:13:01,375
The white guy is the enemy who killed brother.

183
00:13:01,375 --> 00:13:04,875
Same to me.
She's the one who killed my best friend.

184
00:13:06,083 --> 00:13:09,542
Isn't it annoying to say things like this?

185
00:13:32,375 --> 00:13:33,917
She's hit.

186
00:13:35,083 --> 00:13:39,500
Why don't you aim for the neck?
You're too naive.

187
00:13:43,292 --> 00:13:44,708
Why?

188
00:13:50,083 --> 00:13:56,333
You keep thinking how to resolve
my magic nullification skill.

189
00:13:56,333 --> 00:13:57,583
You're right.

190
00:13:57,583 --> 00:14:02,958
As long as you use magic to control the original
material, like soil, it can be resolved.

191
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:04,750
Sadly it didn't work.

192
00:14:08,583 --> 00:14:09,750
Shun.

193
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:16,125
It doesn't matter if we use magic or sword,
we can't defeat her.

194
00:14:17,792 --> 00:14:19,208
Fei...

195
00:14:19,208 --> 00:14:21,917
You're done watching the battle?

196
00:14:21,917 --> 00:14:23,250
Yes.

197
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:27,750
We will surrender to you. Can you let us live?

198
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:30,208
Let Brother Hyrince and Anna go as well.

199
00:14:30,208 --> 00:14:31,583
Fei.

200
00:14:33,042 --> 00:14:38,083
That means you know
the consequence of trying to fight me, right?

201
00:14:38,083 --> 00:14:39,583
Yes.

202
00:14:39,583 --> 00:14:43,292
Why didn't you stop your friends then?

203
00:14:43,292 --> 00:14:45,750
Shun wouldn't listen even if I did.

204
00:14:49,083 --> 00:14:50,833
What do you mean?

205
00:14:50,833 --> 00:14:54,083
That's the pride of boys.

206
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Pride? Fei, you knew that,
so you picked the right time to surrender?

207
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,083
Getting my friends involved
in a fight that we can't win,

208
00:15:07,083 --> 00:15:08,708
I'm useless.

209
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:10,625
Pride?

210
00:15:10,625 --> 00:15:15,250
That means, compared to living, it's sometimes
more important to defend your pride in a fight?

211
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:18,625
This is a situation I can't understand.

212
00:15:20,417 --> 00:15:25,125
Okay. For the sake of pride,
I shall spare your life.

213
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:27,167
Thank you so much.

214
00:15:27,167 --> 00:15:29,542
Although I didn't beg you.

215
00:15:29,542 --> 00:15:30,542
Kagawa.

216
00:15:30,542 --> 00:15:33,250
Oh, you're defeated.

217
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:35,667
I'm so sorry.

218
00:15:35,667 --> 00:15:41,542
If it's the original person, it's hard to say.
Do you think by sending a clone

219
00:15:41,542 --> 00:15:43,958
you could stop us?

220
00:15:43,958 --> 00:15:49,750
Please forgive me for not being
able to protect you wholeheartedly.

221
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:55,583
You've been protecting me.
Why would you be useless?

222
00:15:55,583 --> 00:15:57,333
Thank you for the compliment.

223
00:15:57,333 --> 00:16:01,583
There's no business for you anymore.
Concentrate on commanding the legion.

224
00:16:01,583 --> 00:16:03,208
I get it.

225
00:16:05,208 --> 00:16:10,792
The original person is leading the army.
If you want to fight him, you may go there.

226
00:16:10,792 --> 00:16:13,333
I must defeat you before that.

227
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:15,750
Even if you two help, we can't win.

228
00:16:17,042 --> 00:16:19,458
Kuni, you should know that as well.

229
00:16:20,833 --> 00:16:25,708
Fei, sorry. I can't give up.

230
00:16:25,708 --> 00:16:27,750
Shun.

231
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:30,125
I must overcome this battle.

232
00:16:30,125 --> 00:16:36,667
Even if I have no winning chance,
I have to try to face it.

233
00:16:36,667 --> 00:16:39,208
This battle is so important.

234
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:46,250
If it were Brother Julius,
he would never run away in such a situation.

235
00:16:47,417 --> 00:16:51,583
So I can't run away either.

236
00:16:55,292 --> 00:16:57,208
I really can't help you.

237
00:16:59,333 --> 00:17:03,125
I shall play with you then.

238
00:17:03,125 --> 00:17:05,333
We don't have the time.

239
00:17:09,791 --> 00:17:10,999
Kuni...

240
00:17:14,041 --> 00:17:16,082
Kagawa, Kushitani.

241
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,916
You're very fast.

242
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:25,041
You're the one who's too slow.

243
00:17:25,041 --> 00:17:27,249
You didn't kill them, right?

244
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:29,083
They haven't died.

245
00:17:29,083 --> 00:17:31,750
Wasting time here isn't the best policy.

246
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:34,500
So I let them calm down for now.

247
00:17:36,042 --> 00:17:37,667
You are...

248
00:17:37,667 --> 00:17:39,000
Long time no see.

249
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:43,625
Long time no see.
You can't have forgotten me, right?

250
00:17:43,625 --> 00:17:45,958
Kyouya.

251
00:17:45,958 --> 00:17:47,542
Turns out you still remember me.

252
00:17:47,542 --> 00:17:51,333
My image isn't quite the same anymore.
I thought you wouldn't recognise me.

253
00:17:52,542 --> 00:17:56,083
Are you really Kyouya?

254
00:17:56,083 --> 00:18:01,292
Yes. I'm Sasajima Kyouya indeed.

255
00:18:01,292 --> 00:18:03,917
Shun. Kanata.

256
00:18:03,917 --> 00:18:06,625
You're on the Demon Clan's side?

257
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:07,708
Yes.

258
00:18:07,708 --> 00:18:09,125
Why?

259
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:14,417
Is there a need to ask?
To kill the elves, of course.

260
00:18:15,583 --> 00:18:22,750
I don't quite understand you.
Why are you on the elf's side?

261
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:24,542
I...

262
00:18:24,542 --> 00:18:28,500
You must have listened
to the sweet words of the elves.

263
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,833
What does it mean?

264
00:18:29,833 --> 00:18:32,417
Elves are the disaster of this world.

265
00:18:32,417 --> 00:18:34,875
You actually want to protect them?
You must be crazy.

266
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:36,708
Don't lie.

267
00:18:36,708 --> 00:18:41,583
Although I don't know what plan the Admins have,
it must be something bad.

268
00:18:42,667 --> 00:18:48,375
Did you forget what they did in the kingdom?
What they used Hugo to do?

269
00:18:48,375 --> 00:18:49,292
That is...

270
00:18:49,292 --> 00:18:53,208
Besides, it's Demon Legion
who killed Warrior Julius.

271
00:18:53,208 --> 00:18:57,917
Am I right, commander of
the 8th Demon Legion, Wrath?

272
00:18:57,917 --> 00:19:01,542
Kyouya is a commander too?

273
00:19:01,542 --> 00:19:04,083
It seems useless to persuade them.

274
00:19:07,917 --> 00:19:10,333
Did you bring reinforcement?

275
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:12,458
There are too many of them.

276
00:19:16,125 --> 00:19:19,250
Didn't Master also tell us

277
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:24,708
that teacher has always been
hidden from the truth? She wouldn't believe us.

278
00:19:24,708 --> 00:19:25,750
Shun.

279
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:29,542
What is the truth?

280
00:19:32,583 --> 00:19:35,458
Lord Warrior, please come back immediately.

281
00:19:35,458 --> 00:19:37,708
Devil is heading to the village.

282
00:19:37,708 --> 00:19:41,167
If the Warrior isn't around,
we can never defeat her.

283
00:19:41,167 --> 00:19:42,417
Devil?

284
00:19:42,417 --> 00:19:46,083
Leave this to us. Please go back to the village.

285
00:19:49,417 --> 00:19:50,333
However...

286
00:19:50,333 --> 00:19:51,667
Please go back quickly.

287
00:19:51,667 --> 00:19:53,917
I shall teleport you. Please come here.

288
00:19:53,917 --> 00:19:55,458
You wish.

289
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:02,250
Everyone, attack!

290
00:20:05,083 --> 00:20:06,500
You're so in the way.

291
00:20:17,625 --> 00:20:19,375
I won't let you go, Shun.

292
00:20:21,625 --> 00:20:25,750
Teleport completed.
Honourable Messengers, activated.

293
00:20:31,208 --> 00:20:33,167
Oh no.

294
00:20:33,167 --> 00:20:35,292
The annoying things are here.

295
00:20:36,125 --> 00:20:37,708
Everyone, make way.

296
00:20:38,542 --> 00:20:40,375
Let the Honourable Messengers through.

297
00:20:42,917 --> 00:20:46,000
So what if they're big,
they're just mechanic dolls.

298
00:20:48,292 --> 00:20:50,542
It didn't work.

299
00:20:50,542 --> 00:20:52,167
This is irritating.

300
00:20:55,083 --> 00:20:59,208
They hid these things? These elves...

301
00:20:59,208 --> 00:21:03,000
Magic puppets?
There are actually such things in this world?

302
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,042
So there's no chance for my debut?

303
00:21:07,042 --> 00:21:10,292
The situation seems to be getting worse.

304
00:21:10,292 --> 00:21:14,375
To put it bluntly, you were playing too much.

305
00:21:14,375 --> 00:21:16,083
You're annoying.

306
00:21:16,083 --> 00:21:17,417
Aim.

307
00:21:19,458 --> 00:21:20,500
Hold on.

308
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,500
Shoot!

309
00:21:24,625 --> 00:21:26,667
Kyouya!

Even such things have appeared,
that means Potimas is showing his real skill.

329
00:23:16,417 --> 00:23:19,792
The gunfire there seems to be very fierce.

330
00:23:20,458 --> 00:23:24,667
What's the matter? Do you care so much?
Why don't you check it out?

331
00:23:24,667 --> 00:23:28,292
I can handle this alone.

332
00:23:28,292 --> 00:23:31,792
Just in case, I shall check it out.

333
00:23:36,333 --> 00:23:41,458
SO I'M A SPIDER, SO WHAT?
NEXT EPISODE: I'M STILL A SPIDER, SO WHAT? STAY TUNED
