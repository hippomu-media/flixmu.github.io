1
00:00:14,292 --> 00:00:15,792
To be alive

2
00:00:15,792 --> 00:00:18,583
is something really wonderful.

3
00:00:19,375 --> 00:00:22,083
What do I do from now on?

4
00:00:23,083 --> 00:00:28,167
A pothole. Aren't these formed
when a meteorite hits the ground?

5
00:00:28,167 --> 00:00:31,000
I'll be dead if I encounter such things again.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,208
I won't be as lucky

7
00:00:33,208 --> 00:00:36,458
all the time.

8
00:00:36,458 --> 00:00:38,458
I can only count on this skill.

9
00:00:38,458 --> 00:00:40,792
'HIDDEN"
All I can do

10
00:00:40,792 --> 00:00:43,333
is to hide.

11
00:00:44,042 --> 00:00:48,083
EPISODE 4: MONKEY, WHA—?

00:01:04,292 --> 00:01:08,000

♫Wait and see♫

35
00:02:08,667 --> 00:02:14,167
SO I'M A SPIDER, SO WHAT?

36
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:19,917
I had decided not to run away,

37
00:02:22,292 --> 00:02:24,750
but I still ran away.

38
00:02:26,583 --> 00:02:30,667
I hope this path leads to safety.

39
00:02:47,875 --> 00:02:49,917
THE MANTIS-LIKE MONSTER THAT
LIVES IN THE LOWER STRATUM

40
00:02:49,917 --> 00:02:50,875
OF GREAT ELROE LABYRINTH.

41
00:02:50,875 --> 00:02:52,583
GOOD AT POWERFUL PHYSICAL ATTACKS WITH SICKLES.

42
00:02:56,333 --> 00:02:59,000
The Lower Stratum of Great Elroe Labyrinth.

43
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,292
I'm only told now that this is
the Great Elroe Labyrinth.

44
00:03:02,292 --> 00:03:04,083
It's even the Lower Stratum

45
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:07,750
and the habitat of powerful monsters.

46
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:09,625
I would rather not know this.

47
00:03:10,375 --> 00:03:13,333
This mantis must be stronger than the snake.

48
00:03:13,333 --> 00:03:16,958
Could the snake actually be unimportant here?

49
00:03:19,667 --> 00:03:20,917
No...

50
00:03:20,917 --> 00:03:23,792
The mantis is just too strong.

51
00:03:29,458 --> 00:03:30,833
GREATER TARATECT. LEVEL 18.

52
00:03:30,833 --> 00:03:31,917
THE EVOLVED SPIDER MONSTER.

53
00:03:31,917 --> 00:03:33,375
CARNIVOROUS. FATAL VENOMOUS FANGS.

54
00:03:33,375 --> 00:03:37,250
Is that what I'll become when I evolve?

55
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:40,125
How can I defeat this monster?

56
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:43,500
I'll eat a monster that I can defeat.

57
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:46,458
Other than that, I'll just hide.

58
00:03:46,458 --> 00:03:50,375
My survival is depended on hiding now.

59
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:55,625
I can't even have a good night sleep.

60
00:03:55,625 --> 00:03:57,625
This is horrible.

61
00:03:59,542 --> 00:04:04,125
I have to eat before this value is used up.

62
00:04:04,125 --> 00:04:07,833
But food is easy to get.

63
00:04:08,667 --> 00:04:11,083
I only realised while I kept going

64
00:04:11,083 --> 00:04:14,875
that there are monsters of higher level
in this lower stratum.

65
00:04:14,875 --> 00:04:17,167
The similarity of these monsters is...

66
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:19,250
SCHOOL OF ELROE

67
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:21,458
Here I come.

68
00:04:21,458 --> 00:04:24,208
That they're all venomous.

69
00:04:24,208 --> 00:04:25,750
LOWER STRATUM VENOMOUS TEAM

70
00:04:26,458 --> 00:04:28,542
Being venomous is awesome.

71
00:04:28,542 --> 00:04:31,375
Even if I'm found, they may just let me go.

72
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,750
ELROE EFEJICOTE. LEVEL 3.

73
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:36,625
ABILITY IDENTIFICATION FAILED.

74
00:04:36,625 --> 00:04:42,625
These river snails are everywhere.
Why aren't they eaten?

75
00:04:42,625 --> 00:04:44,500
I shall go ahead then.

76
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,292
I'll eat now.

77
00:04:59,167 --> 00:05:03,708
ALTHOUGH IT WAS SHORT, THANKS FOR WATCHING.
SO I'M A SPIDER, SO WHAT? THE END.

78
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:10,792
I'm almost dead.

79
00:05:10,792 --> 00:05:12,042
What is this?

80
00:05:12,042 --> 00:05:13,875
Such creatures shouldn't exist!

81
00:05:13,875 --> 00:05:14,958
For example,

82
00:05:14,958 --> 00:05:17,667
this is just like old kitchen waste
that was cooked in warm milk

83
00:05:17,667 --> 00:05:21,500
in a hot summer.

84
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:24,000
Proficiency achieved a certain level.

85
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,875
ACID ENDURANCE UPGRADED FROM LEVEL TWO TO THREE.
Acid endurance upgraded from level two to three.

86
00:05:27,875 --> 00:05:31,000
Hey! What kind of attribute is this?

87
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:36,042
I really don't want to eat such things anymore.

88
00:05:36,042 --> 00:05:37,500
However...

89
00:05:38,417 --> 00:05:43,208
However my principle is not to waste food.

90
00:05:50,042 --> 00:05:52,250
Seriously...

91
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:55,375
I will eat it when there's no other choice.

92
00:05:58,083 --> 00:06:00,208
Because there's no sun,

93
00:06:00,208 --> 00:06:03,458
I don't even know how long I've been walking.

94
00:06:03,458 --> 00:06:08,458
I'm afraid I have been walking on
this path for days now.

95
00:06:08,458 --> 00:06:10,875
I'm so anxious.

96
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:15,500
What if this road leads to the Bottom Stratum?

97
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,917
Annoying. Stop imagining.

98
00:06:17,917 --> 00:06:20,333
It must be leading to Middle Stratum.

99
00:06:21,333 --> 00:06:22,417
It should be, right?

100
00:06:27,375 --> 00:06:30,042
I must find something edible this time.

101
00:06:30,042 --> 00:06:32,167
I just finished my sentence.

102
00:06:33,958 --> 00:06:35,875
ELROE DINO MONSTER. LEVEL 7 AND 8.
ABILITY IDENTIFICATION FAILED.

103
00:06:35,875 --> 00:06:39,083
This is the Lower Stratum indeed.
Their levels are so high.

104
00:06:39,083 --> 00:06:42,917
The one with level 8 may evolve soon.

105
00:06:43,958 --> 00:06:47,750
But you will not be able to live til then.

106
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:51,125
Hooray!

107
00:06:51,125 --> 00:06:52,708
Condition fulfilled.

108
00:06:52,708 --> 00:06:56,208
The title "Venom Master" obtained.

109
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:58,875
As a result of being a Venom Master,

110
00:06:58,875 --> 00:07:03,833
level one venom synthesis skill and
level one venom magic skill obtained.

111
00:07:03,833 --> 00:07:06,625
-Is it venom? It's venom.
-Proficiency achieved a certain level.

112
00:07:06,625 --> 00:07:10,833
-So much venom. Today is a good day for venom.
-Venomous fangs are upgraded to level eight.

113
00:07:21,292 --> 00:07:23,625
I'm so full...

114
00:07:24,417 --> 00:07:25,500
Okay.

115
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,625
"VENOM MAGIC. VENOM SYNTHESIS."
Let's confirm these skills.

116
00:07:27,625 --> 00:07:29,000
Let's see.

117
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,542
Venom magic.

118
00:07:30,542 --> 00:07:35,000
I still don't know how to use magic.
So I'll just leave it aside for now.

119
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,583
Venom synthesis.

120
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:40,833
Should I try it?

121
00:07:40,833 --> 00:07:42,458
Whisper.

122
00:07:42,458 --> 00:07:44,042
Pray.

123
00:07:44,042 --> 00:07:45,250
Then,

124
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:47,167
chant!

125
00:07:47,167 --> 00:07:49,708
Time for the show.

126
00:07:50,833 --> 00:07:51,708
Come on!

127
00:07:51,708 --> 00:07:54,583
Venom synthesis!

128
00:07:56,333 --> 00:07:57,958
There are many unhappy incidents in life.

129
00:07:57,958 --> 00:07:59,500
Something appeared.

130
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:00,625
MATERIAL FOR VENOM SYNTHESIS, WEAK VENOM.
SPIDER VENOM LEVEL EIGHT.

131
00:08:00,625 --> 00:08:02,500
"VENOM THAT CAN BE SYNTHESISED"
I shall try making it.

132
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,333
WEAK VENOM

133
00:08:08,667 --> 00:08:10,458
It's good that this appeared,

134
00:08:10,458 --> 00:08:12,667
but how should I use this?

135
00:08:12,667 --> 00:08:14,167
Put it in a bottle?

136
00:08:14,167 --> 00:08:15,833
"WEAK VENOM WATER"
I don't have such things.

137
00:08:15,833 --> 00:08:18,833
Besides, my magic value decreased.

138
00:08:21,458 --> 00:08:22,667
It's a little hard to use.

139
00:08:23,708 --> 00:08:26,542
However, compared to the all-out magical tools,

140
00:08:26,542 --> 00:08:28,958
these are at least usable.

141
00:08:33,707 --> 00:08:37,874
Such a space that has nothing
is really troublesome.

142
00:08:38,667 --> 00:08:41,542
I shall use the basic maze strategy here,

143
00:08:41,542 --> 00:08:44,542
which is to walk along the wall on the right.

144
00:08:44,542 --> 00:08:47,083
But this place is really big.

145
00:08:47,083 --> 00:08:50,458
I'm in a burrow
but I don't feel the sense of closure.

146
00:08:50,458 --> 00:08:51,958
Although there are stones everywhere,

147
00:08:51,958 --> 00:08:54,333
I still can see the vastness of nature.

148
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:55,875
Being in here

149
00:08:55,875 --> 00:09:00,292
makes me feel how small my existence is.

150
00:09:00,292 --> 00:09:01,167
In my previous life,

151
00:09:01,167 --> 00:09:04,458
even when I watched shows
about the secret worlds

152
00:09:04,458 --> 00:09:06,500
I didn't feel touched.

153
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:09,208
Because the beautiful view in the picture

154
00:09:09,208 --> 00:09:12,625
is a faraway world to me.

155
00:09:12,625 --> 00:09:15,667
But now that I'm here,

156
00:09:15,667 --> 00:09:18,458
a world that I'm living in,

157
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:20,000
it isn't irrelevant to me.

158
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,208
I can't be indifferent.

159
00:09:22,917 --> 00:09:24,875
Something is closing.

160
00:09:28,792 --> 00:09:30,917
BAGRAGRATCH. LEVEL 14.
ABILITY IDENTIFICATION FAILED.

161
00:09:33,708 --> 00:09:36,667
What kind of dangerous thing is that?

162
00:09:36,667 --> 00:09:38,708
Run before it finds me.

163
00:09:41,292 --> 00:09:43,167
What's going on?

164
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:47,208
BAGRAGRATCH. ABILITY IDENTIFICATION FAILED.

165
00:09:47,958 --> 00:09:50,458
I have to run faster.

166
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:53,542
They look strong and they're in a group.

167
00:09:53,542 --> 00:09:55,458
I have no chance of winning.

168
00:09:59,667 --> 00:10:03,750
Monkey? It looks a little different from
those just now.

169
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:05,083
So fast.

170
00:10:05,083 --> 00:10:07,125
Seriously? Another style.

171
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:09,833
No. If I were hit by the fist,

172
00:10:09,833 --> 00:10:12,083
I would be dead.

173
00:10:14,792 --> 00:10:19,458
Continuous attack of fatal punch.
I can't feel anything than fear.

174
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:25,500
I'm moving too obviously because of anxiousness.

175
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,875
You can't do anything if I hold your fist.

176
00:10:27,875 --> 00:10:30,208
How is that? Unhappy?

177
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:33,292
Oh no!

178
00:10:40,667 --> 00:10:41,875
I'm saved!

179
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:44,167
Although I feel like it brought it to itself,

180
00:10:44,167 --> 00:10:45,500
I still won.

181
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:46,875
Last strike!

182
00:10:57,167 --> 00:10:59,417
Did I win?

183
00:10:59,417 --> 00:11:01,708
Experience level achieved a certain target.

184
00:11:01,708 --> 00:11:04,417
Upgraded from level three to four.

185
00:11:04,417 --> 00:11:07,167
Basic abilities are improved.

186
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:09,792
The scream before death shocked me,

187
00:11:09,792 --> 00:11:11,292
but my level is upgraded.

188
00:11:11,292 --> 00:11:14,583
I'm going to taste it now.

189
00:11:16,542 --> 00:11:18,625
I'm full...

190
00:11:18,625 --> 00:11:21,417
It is not bitter at all,

191
00:11:21,417 --> 00:11:24,417
but it's still not tasty.

192
00:11:25,458 --> 00:11:29,417
Pigs and cows from my previous life
were so great.

193
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:32,667
I'm sleepy.

194
00:11:32,667 --> 00:11:34,292
Because I haven't been sleeping well.

195
00:11:34,292 --> 00:11:37,500
Hence I'm so sleepy after food.

196
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:40,958
If I can't find a way to sleep well,

197
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:43,375
my body will not be able to take it.

198
00:12:02,833 --> 00:12:06,583
Bring me more meat.

199
00:12:11,917 --> 00:12:15,208
What's going on? I'm feeling the chill.

200
00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:23,500
It hurts.

201
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,042
Seriously?

202
00:12:28,042 --> 00:12:31,708
In order not to be found, I camouflaged.

203
00:12:32,667 --> 00:12:35,208
Could the scream that monkey made before it died

204
00:12:35,208 --> 00:12:37,958
release some special scent?

205
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:40,750
So they're back for revenge?

206
00:12:41,875 --> 00:12:44,917
There are so many of them.
I can never defeat them.

207
00:12:44,917 --> 00:12:47,375
They still need some time to climb up.

208
00:12:50,917 --> 00:12:54,042
Odd. The rock here is different.

209
00:12:54,042 --> 00:12:55,583
I can't climb up.

210
00:12:56,667 --> 00:12:59,958
No choice. I have to move side way.

211
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,583
It hurts...

212
00:13:06,583 --> 00:13:08,625
There's no way to run.

213
00:13:10,708 --> 00:13:12,000
Although this is tough,

214
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,125
this is my house after all.

215
00:13:14,125 --> 00:13:15,917
I have to keep going.

216
00:13:22,208 --> 00:13:24,083
It hurts!

217
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:26,958
Horrible. This is tricky.

218
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:31,042
And they are half way here now.

219
00:13:31,042 --> 00:13:33,750
It would be good if I can throw something.

220
00:13:39,917 --> 00:13:42,083
Venom synthesis.

221
00:13:42,083 --> 00:13:42,917
SPIDER VENOM. LEVEL EIGHT.

222
00:13:42,917 --> 00:13:44,042
Take this!

223
00:13:51,917 --> 00:13:54,083
Trying to attack from the side?

224
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:56,292
My magic value isn't quite enough.

225
00:13:56,292 --> 00:13:58,417
I can't pour my venom there.

226
00:14:00,667 --> 00:14:02,833
Great. They've stopped moving.

227
00:14:02,833 --> 00:14:04,917
This shall buy me some time.

228
00:14:07,833 --> 00:14:10,625
This is not the time to save strength.

229
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:12,833
Once again!

230
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:16,167
These fellows are smart.

231
00:14:16,167 --> 00:14:22,417
If you're so smart, you should know
there's no point defeating such a small spider.

232
00:14:22,417 --> 00:14:25,375
It looks like there are more of them now.

233
00:14:25,375 --> 00:14:28,542
What should I do?

234
00:14:28,542 --> 00:14:30,917
If this keeps going on, I'll die.

235
00:14:32,292 --> 00:14:33,625
Take this.

236
00:14:34,417 --> 00:14:36,667
Great. Use them as the road blocks.

237
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:38,458
It can buy me some time.

238
00:14:41,958 --> 00:14:44,208
How is this possible?

239
00:14:44,875 --> 00:14:49,333
In order to not stop those at the back
from attacking, they sacrificed themselves.

240
00:14:51,083 --> 00:14:53,042
I can't hold anything back.

241
00:14:53,833 --> 00:14:57,167
This is the final battle between me and them.

242
00:14:57,167 --> 00:14:59,833
Only when one party is dead, this will end.

243
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,250
Have you forgotten how weak you are?

244
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:08,667
Your opponent isn't someone unimportant.

245
00:15:08,667 --> 00:15:11,417
They're expendables who are not afraid to die.

246
00:15:11,417 --> 00:15:13,875
You can't defeat them just by joking around.

247
00:15:14,375 --> 00:15:16,583
Alright!

248
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:18,958
Oh no!

249
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:41,417
It hurts...

250
00:15:43,042 --> 00:15:44,833
I can't take this anymore.

251
00:15:44,833 --> 00:15:47,375
"SMALL TARATECT UPGRADED FROM LEVEL FOUR TO FIVE"
Experience level achieved a certain target.

252
00:15:47,375 --> 00:15:49,875
Level upgraded to five.

253
00:15:49,875 --> 00:15:52,167
Great timing.

254
00:15:52,167 --> 00:15:53,542
Can I make it in time?

255
00:16:04,417 --> 00:16:07,167
That was close.

256
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:08,792
Although I've recovered,

257
00:16:08,792 --> 00:16:11,542
losing my home is saddening.

258
00:16:12,625 --> 00:16:14,250
I still have other tricks.

259
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:17,125
If even this doesn't work, I'm dead.

260
00:16:20,083 --> 00:16:22,417
But if I don't give it a go,

261
00:16:22,417 --> 00:16:23,958
I'll be dead as well.

262
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:26,833
Come on...

263
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,958
Take this!

264
00:16:56,417 --> 00:16:59,083
"SMALL TARATECT UPGRADED FROM LEVEL SIX TO SEVEN"
Experience level achieved a certain target.

265
00:16:59,083 --> 00:17:01,208
"BASIC ABILITIES UPGRADED"
Level upgraded to seven.

266
00:17:01,208 --> 00:17:02,208
REWARD OF UPGRADED SKILL PROFICIENCY
HIDING SKILL UPGRADED FROM LEVEL FIVE TO SIX.

267
00:17:02,208 --> 00:17:04,416
"DODGING SKILL UPGRADED FROM ONE TO TWO."
I thought I would be dead.

268
00:17:04,416 --> 00:17:05,249
PAIN REDUCING SKILL UPGRADED FROM LEVEL FIVE TO SIX.
AND SKILL POINT.

269
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:09,125
After defeating so many monsters,
I've increased by two levels.

270
00:17:10,291 --> 00:17:11,916
How many are they?

271
00:17:12,875 --> 00:17:15,708
BAGRAGRATCH. FROM LEVEL THREE TO SIX.
ABILITY IDENTIFICATION FAILED.

272
00:17:15,708 --> 00:17:18,666
I should have noticed
when I see the similar names.

273
00:17:18,666 --> 00:17:21,124
These must be the evolved version
of those monkeys.

274
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:24,416
I must set more spider webs.

275
00:17:28,792 --> 00:17:31,000
How can they move that so easily?

276
00:17:32,333 --> 00:17:33,167
Hold on!

277
00:17:34,167 --> 00:17:35,583
This can't be real.

278
00:17:35,583 --> 00:17:38,458
I would surely be dead if I were hit by it.

279
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:41,125
And I have no place to stay.

280
00:17:41,125 --> 00:17:43,333
If I have to keep looking down,

281
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:45,125
I may show my weakness.

282
00:17:45,125 --> 00:17:48,042
They will not miss such a good chance.

283
00:17:48,042 --> 00:17:49,542
There's no time to hesitate.

284
00:17:49,542 --> 00:17:51,000
First this,

285
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,417
then...

286
00:17:55,708 --> 00:17:58,375
They're indeed creatures who learn well.

287
00:17:58,375 --> 00:18:00,583
They use their bodies to make paths
for those at the back to attack.

288
00:18:00,583 --> 00:18:03,125
Most of the webs are useless now.

289
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:09,708
They sacrificed themselves to make way again.

290
00:18:09,708 --> 00:18:14,333
But if they keep progressing with this method,
their amount will decreased as well.

291
00:18:14,333 --> 00:18:18,333
If this keeps going on, they'll all be dead
by the time they reach me.

292
00:18:18,333 --> 00:18:19,792
With the precondition

293
00:18:19,792 --> 00:18:22,417
that these fellows don't start attacking.

294
00:18:30,667 --> 00:18:32,042
Oh no!

295
00:18:39,708 --> 00:18:41,458
Take this!

296
00:18:44,792 --> 00:18:45,917
SPIDER VENOM. LEVEL EIGHT.

297
00:18:45,917 --> 00:18:47,417
Take this!

298
00:18:57,917 --> 00:19:00,375
Experience level achieved a certain target.

299
00:19:00,375 --> 00:19:03,042
Level upgraded to eight.

300
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:06,708
I'll deal with this one first.

301
00:19:06,708 --> 00:19:07,958
The next one...

302
00:19:07,958 --> 00:19:09,875
The next one is so quick. It's on me now.

303
00:19:09,875 --> 00:19:11,625
But it's too naive.

304
00:19:15,208 --> 00:19:17,917
Good. Where's the other one?

305
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:31,583
I'm going to faint.

306
00:19:32,208 --> 00:19:34,917
If I faint, I'll surely be dead.

307
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:39,958
My sight is becoming blurry.

308
00:19:39,958 --> 00:19:43,583
But this is not the time to say this.

309
00:19:47,042 --> 00:19:49,500
Don't you run!

310
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:52,458
Three strikes of synthesised venom.

311
00:19:59,625 --> 00:20:01,708
I can't do this anymore.

312
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,500
Experience level achieved a certain target.

313
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,708
Level upgraded to nine.

314
00:20:24,458 --> 00:20:28,333
That was really close.

315
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:32,625
Next, I only have to deal with
all these fellows I caught.

316
00:20:38,042 --> 00:20:39,292
Do you know? This is the prelude.

317
00:20:39,292 --> 00:20:41,583
The life of a spider.

318
00:20:41,583 --> 00:20:43,167
I'm going to start singing.

00:21:54,875 --> 00:21:56,083
♫I will not forgive you, admin D♫

362
00:21:56,083 --> 00:21:57,250
♫The big labyrinth is just as dark today♫

363
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:58,417
♫Keep living or die trying♫

364
00:21:58,417 --> 00:21:59,667
♫Although this kind of life
is quite interesting♫

365
00:21:59,667 --> 00:22:01,417
♫I still can't accept why♫

366
00:22:01,417 --> 00:22:04,292
♫I am a spider♫

367
00:22:05,208 --> 00:22:06,833
You deserve this.

368
00:22:06,833 --> 00:22:08,625
Although I reincarnated as a spider,

369
00:22:08,625 --> 00:22:10,083
I'm still alive.

370
00:22:10,083 --> 00:22:13,083
I survived!

371
00:22:13,083 --> 00:22:16,125
Now that I think about it,
I was hit by an earth dragon,

372
00:22:16,125 --> 00:22:18,292
and when I escaped,

373
00:22:18,292 --> 00:22:21,375
my heart was filled with fear and regret.

374
00:22:21,375 --> 00:22:24,958
I broke the promise I made
when my house was burnt down.

375
00:22:24,958 --> 00:22:28,250
In order to survive, I kept running.

376
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:30,292
Then I felt regret.

377
00:22:30,292 --> 00:22:33,750
That's how I survived in these battles.

378
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:35,083
I'm so happy.

379
00:22:35,083 --> 00:22:37,000
I'm so happy!

380
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,625
Experience level achieved a certain target.

381
00:22:39,625 --> 00:22:41,833
Level upgraded to ten.

382
00:22:41,833 --> 00:22:43,750
Conditions fulfilled.

383
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:46,625
Small taratect may evolve.

384
00:22:46,625 --> 00:22:49,375
EVOLUTION OPTIONS
SPIDER MONSTER OR SMALL VENOMOUS SPIDER

385
00:22:49,375 --> 00:22:52,042
I see. I'm already at level 10.

386
00:22:52,042 --> 00:22:54,875
Because my level kept upgrading.

387
00:22:54,875 --> 00:22:57,208
Let's talk about evolution later.

388
00:22:57,208 --> 00:22:58,792
In this barren place

389
00:22:58,792 --> 00:23:01,500
I really can't evolve.

390
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:05,792
By the way, the monkeys didn't call backup.

391
00:23:07,042 --> 00:23:08,792
This way goes uphill.

392
00:23:08,792 --> 00:23:11,625
Perhaps it's a way
that leads to the Middle Stratum.

393
00:23:11,625 --> 00:23:14,333
Hooray! Let's climb upwards!

394
00:23:14,333 --> 00:23:17,917
So I can say goodbye to the most dangerous area.

395
00:23:17,917 --> 00:23:21,667
I wonder if it's because of my excitement,
my body feels hot.

396
00:23:21,667 --> 00:23:25,958
I didn't know a spider's
body temperature increases.

397
00:23:27,042 --> 00:23:29,917
I can finally relax.

398
00:23:32,875 --> 00:23:35,708
What?

399
00:23:36,292 --> 00:23:39,000
SO I'M A SPIDER, SO WHAT?
NEXT EPISODE: CATFISH, DELICIOUS?

400
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,458
STAY TUNED.
