1
00:00:04,625 --> 00:00:06,375
Shun.

2
00:00:06,375 --> 00:00:08,583
Hey, Shun.

3
00:00:08,583 --> 00:00:10,958
Hey! Are you listening, Shun?

4
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:15,542
Sorry. What were you saying?

5
00:00:15,542 --> 00:00:17,625
I was talking about Hugo.

6
00:00:18,667 --> 00:00:21,167
After the assassination plan failed,

7
00:00:21,167 --> 00:00:24,250
he seems to have disappeared from the school.

8
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:27,708
He has done such outrageous things.
Of course he isn't allowed in school again.

9
00:00:27,708 --> 00:00:31,458
I don't understand
why he wasn't punished properly.

10
00:00:31,458 --> 00:00:35,292
Prince Renxandt wanted
to assassinate Prince Analeit.

11
00:00:35,292 --> 00:00:37,458
If everyone knows about this,

12
00:00:37,458 --> 00:00:39,375
there will be wars.

13
00:00:40,042 --> 00:00:44,458
Does this mean, they dealt with this privately?

14
00:00:44,458 --> 00:00:47,250
I'm not sure either.

15
00:00:53,625 --> 00:00:59,333
In his previous life,
he wouldn't do such things.

16
00:01:01,375 --> 00:01:04,000
Yes, you're right.

17
00:01:05,042 --> 00:01:09,083

SO I'M A SPIDER, SO WHAT?

42
00:02:36,583 --> 00:02:38,542
Hey, Shun.

43
00:02:38,542 --> 00:02:40,000
What?

44
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,875
Why are we admiring maple leaves again?

45
00:02:42,875 --> 00:02:45,667
"YAMADA SHUNSUKE"
The preparation of Cultural Festival is done.

46
00:02:45,667 --> 00:02:48,208
It's supposed to be our free time.

47
00:02:48,208 --> 00:02:50,875
Don't ask me.

48
00:02:50,875 --> 00:02:54,083
Today's lesson is an off-campus.

49
00:02:54,083 --> 00:02:57,333
Let's go admire maple leaves.

50
00:02:57,333 --> 00:03:00,125
Oka wouldn't listen to us.

51
00:03:00,125 --> 00:03:02,042
It's okay, Kanata.

52
00:03:02,042 --> 00:03:04,542
It's not so bad to be out sometimes.

53
00:03:04,542 --> 00:03:07,125
Kyo likes outdoor activities too,
that's why he doesn't mind.

54
00:03:07,125 --> 00:03:09,917
But I like indoor activities.

55
00:03:09,917 --> 00:03:12,458
We're in high school now,
yet we have to come to parks.

56
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:15,417
Don't you feel like a primary school student?

57
00:03:15,417 --> 00:03:21,083
Don't leave the park and cause trouble.

58
00:03:24,417 --> 00:03:26,875
She thinks we're kids.

59
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:32,917
But it's better than
doing nothing in the classroom.

60
00:03:32,917 --> 00:03:33,542
OOSHIMA KANATA

61
00:03:33,542 --> 00:03:36,958
"OOSHIMA KANATA"
Even chatting in the classroom is better.

62
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:50,333
What are you doing?

63
00:03:50,333 --> 00:03:53,167
Boys, let's play football.

64
00:03:53,167 --> 00:03:54,042
Come on.

65
00:03:54,042 --> 00:03:56,000
Hey, pass me the ball.

66
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,792
Okay, make way...

67
00:03:57,792 --> 00:03:59,917
We want to play football here.

68
00:03:59,917 --> 00:04:03,708
Natsume is always so overpowering.

69
00:04:03,708 --> 00:04:04,417
HASEBE YUIKA

70
00:04:04,417 --> 00:04:06,417
"HASEBE YUIKA"
He's not a bad person.

71
00:04:06,417 --> 00:04:10,458
But he doesn't really listen to others.

72
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:12,417
Alright. If you don't hurry there,

73
00:04:12,417 --> 00:04:15,167
Natsume is going to nag again.

74
00:04:15,958 --> 00:04:17,292
That's right.

75
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:20,124
Let's go.

76
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:21,333
Keep it up!

77
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,000
"SHINOHARA MIREI"
Come on!

78
00:04:25,208 --> 00:04:26,667
"NEGISHI SHOUKO"
Keep it up!

79
00:04:35,167 --> 00:04:37,333
Yamada, take the ball.

80
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,125
Shun.

81
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,750
Yamada, good kick!

82
00:04:55,083 --> 00:04:56,375
I'm so tired.

83
00:04:56,375 --> 00:04:58,333
Running is tiring.

84
00:04:58,333 --> 00:05:00,375
I'm going to get some drinks.

85
00:05:00,375 --> 00:05:03,250
Buy me something as well. Anything is fine.

86
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:04,625
Me too.

87
00:05:04,625 --> 00:05:06,792
Okay, got it.

88
00:05:11,292 --> 00:05:12,667
Riho...

89
00:05:12,667 --> 00:05:15,333
Negishi, when did you come?

90
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:34,458
So scary.

91
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:39,083
This vending machine sells
only unpopular drinks.

92
00:05:41,417 --> 00:05:43,958
Hey, get up!

93
00:05:44,625 --> 00:05:47,583
It's time for group activities.

94
00:05:47,583 --> 00:05:51,250
And you're still reading at such a place.

95
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:53,583
Not gregarious at all.

96
00:05:53,583 --> 00:05:55,917
That's right.

97
00:05:55,917 --> 00:05:58,833
Hey, are you listening?

98
00:06:01,417 --> 00:06:03,542
You...

99
00:06:03,542 --> 00:06:04,750
What are you looking at?

100
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:07,000
Tell me what you're not happy about.

101
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:12,667
What? It's carbonated coffee.

102
00:06:12,667 --> 00:06:14,667
Sorry. What's wrong?

103
00:06:20,792 --> 00:06:22,125
Here you go.

104
00:06:28,333 --> 00:06:30,917
Sorry, I'm late.

105
00:06:30,917 --> 00:06:32,333
What happened?

106
00:06:36,208 --> 00:06:39,667
Nothing. I couldn't buy any normal juices.

107
00:06:41,292 --> 00:06:45,458
Persimmon juice. It looks horrible.

108
00:06:45,458 --> 00:06:47,000
What is this?

109
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,417
No. Because Rihoko bought this.

110
00:06:50,417 --> 00:06:52,958
The drink she buys is really extraordinary.

111
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:58,250
Persimmon juice isn't the worst.

112
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:02,500
Imagine Rihoko appearing
behind you without making a sound.

113
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,583
She's a real version of Sadako.

114
00:07:04,583 --> 00:07:05,625
So scary.

115
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:07,583
Hey, you.

116
00:07:07,583 --> 00:07:10,292
It isn't too nice to call her that.

117
00:07:10,292 --> 00:07:13,333
Sorry. Just call her Neigishi.

118
00:07:14,875 --> 00:07:16,750
What is this?

119
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:18,792
Carbonated black tea.

120
00:07:18,792 --> 00:07:21,000
Look, you shouldn't speak ill.

121
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,542
A boy who speaks ill of others

122
00:07:23,542 --> 00:07:25,333
will not be liked by girls.

123
00:07:25,333 --> 00:07:29,042
It's okay. Kanata likes boys.

124
00:07:29,042 --> 00:07:31,417
I don't have such fetish.

125
00:07:34,292 --> 00:07:38,292
Really. I like girls like all of you.

126
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:41,375
This tastes like grilled sweet potato.

127
00:07:41,375 --> 00:07:45,250
Students, we have to go back now.

128
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:47,750
Shinohara Mirei.

129
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:50,250
Natsume Kengo.

130
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:52,708
Neigishi Shouko.

131
00:07:52,708 --> 00:07:55,292
Hasebe Yuika.

132
00:07:55,292 --> 00:07:57,917
Wakaba Hiro.

133
00:07:57,917 --> 00:08:00,458
Ooshima Kanata.

134
00:08:00,458 --> 00:08:02,958
Sasajima Kyouya.

135
00:08:02,958 --> 00:08:05,875
Yamada Shunsuke.

136
00:08:05,875 --> 00:08:09,208
I wonder how others are living.

137
00:08:09,208 --> 00:08:13,333
It seems 11 people
are under surveillance in the elf village.

138
00:08:13,333 --> 00:08:17,750
Including Natsume, there are six people here.

139
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:20,250
And four people are dead.

140
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:25,625
Two people's locations are known.
She will see them soon.

141
00:08:25,625 --> 00:08:29,958
The locations of the other three are unknown,
we can't help them.

142
00:08:29,958 --> 00:08:32,457
Well, that's true.
We only know the amount of people,

143
00:08:32,457 --> 00:08:36,499
but Oka didn't tell us
which groups they belong to.

144
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:40,125
Secrets make a woman more beautiful.

145
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:41,332
Teacher.

146
00:08:41,332 --> 00:08:43,457
Speak of the devil.

147
00:08:43,457 --> 00:08:47,042
By the way, isn't that the line of a comic?

148
00:08:48,042 --> 00:08:50,375
There's a limit to having secrets.

149
00:08:50,375 --> 00:08:53,792
Just tell us the secret.

150
00:08:55,917 --> 00:08:59,833
Is Kyo in the list of survivors?

151
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:06,125
Yes. Sasajima is living very well.

152
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:11,042
Where is he now?

153
00:09:11,042 --> 00:09:14,708
Sorry, I can't tell you that.

154
00:09:14,708 --> 00:09:16,583
Why?

155
00:09:16,583 --> 00:09:18,083
Sorry.

156
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:20,167
Is Wakaba fine too?

157
00:09:22,292 --> 00:09:23,958
She...

158
00:09:26,458 --> 00:09:29,333
I can't take this anymore!

159
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:33,875
I don't care if you're the admin.

160
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:41,125
Besides, I can't do anything
even after I found out.

161
00:09:42,167 --> 00:09:46,625
Why don't I just live happily as I did?

162
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:54,667
I want to make my life wither gorgeously.

163
00:09:54,667 --> 00:09:58,833
It's so hot. I'm on fire right now.

164
00:09:58,833 --> 00:10:01,125
The person in charge of information,
you're on fire!

165
00:10:01,125 --> 00:10:04,667
Yes, my soul is on fire!

166
00:10:04,667 --> 00:10:07,375
No, I mean you're really on fire!

167
00:10:07,375 --> 00:10:08,542
What?

168
00:10:09,167 --> 00:10:12,333
Water...

169
00:10:12,333 --> 00:10:15,542
Oh right, big amount of synthesised venom.

170
00:10:15,542 --> 00:10:16,792
Roger.

171
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:22,250
Oh no.

172
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:25,792
Sorry. I added paralytic in the venom.

173
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:28,292
Stupid.

174
00:10:28,292 --> 00:10:32,875
If this goes on, I will die.

175
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:33,583
It became zero.

176
00:10:33,583 --> 00:10:34,958
Hold on...

177
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:38,833
Oh no. Activate Patience.

178
00:10:39,625 --> 00:10:43,583
I want to sacrifice my MP value to survive.

179
00:10:47,542 --> 00:10:48,792
It's still on fire.

180
00:10:48,792 --> 00:10:51,167
I shall water it generously!

181
00:10:53,458 --> 00:10:57,500
I've confirmed the effect of Patience
so you will be fine.

182
00:10:59,958 --> 00:11:02,042
I feel tired.

183
00:11:02,042 --> 00:11:04,792
My brain calmed down after getting tired.

184
00:11:04,792 --> 00:11:07,708
Watering myself with venom...

185
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:09,667
That doesn't work.

186
00:11:09,667 --> 00:11:15,042
I know this world is odd with an admin around.

187
00:11:15,042 --> 00:11:19,792
But I can only live like how I did.

188
00:11:19,792 --> 00:11:22,292
If that's the case, I shall think positively.

189
00:11:22,292 --> 00:11:25,458
"WISDOM: n% POWER OF NOT WANTING TO BE GOD"
First, I need to study this.

190
00:11:25,458 --> 00:11:27,250
"THE RULER OF WISDOM"
Got this for free.

191
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:28,458
"ULTIMATE MAGIC AND STAR MAGIC OBTAINED"
Is it really good?

192
00:11:28,458 --> 00:11:31,167
"STAR MAGIC: MP VALUE, MAGIC. RESIST EQUAL ABILITY VALUE"
Nothing is scarier than something free.

193
00:11:31,167 --> 00:11:34,000
"INCREASED TO 100"
No, I shouldn't think too much.

194
00:11:34,583 --> 00:11:39,500
Okay.
There seems to be other destructive skills.

195
00:11:41,583 --> 00:11:44,208
All the skills are at their highest level.

196
00:11:44,208 --> 00:11:47,750
It feels like we're being called to use magic.

197
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:50,792
Do you think so too?

198
00:11:50,792 --> 00:11:52,250
Yes.

199
00:11:53,208 --> 00:11:55,833
Then bring it on.

200
00:11:55,833 --> 00:11:57,292
Okay.

201
00:11:58,417 --> 00:12:04,042
Next, let me explain magic to you,
who are not too bright.

202
00:12:04,042 --> 00:12:05,542
Speak up.

203
00:12:05,542 --> 00:12:08,500
"SEARCH"
Do you know why I understand magic so well?

204
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:13,042
Because Wisdom has the searching function.

205
00:12:13,042 --> 00:12:15,083
Just like Google.

206
00:12:15,083 --> 00:12:16,667
That's right. That's the function.

207
00:12:16,667 --> 00:12:19,458
Just key in what you want to know,
all the relevant words

208
00:12:19,458 --> 00:12:21,167
will appear.

209
00:12:21,167 --> 00:12:23,250
A dreamlike function.

210
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:26,708
So I searched for magic-relevant information.

211
00:12:26,708 --> 00:12:29,875
To use magic, you must first learn a few things.

212
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:31,875
UNDERSTAND MAGIC, CONTROL MAGIC AND CAST SPELLS.

213
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:34,958
You must learn these.

214
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:38,708
Wisdom will help us in understanding magic,
so it isn't a problem.

215
00:12:38,708 --> 00:12:40,333
Wisdom is the best.

216
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:42,417
Next up, controlling magic.

217
00:12:42,417 --> 00:12:45,500
Imagine magic like flowing fluid,

218
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,833
you can control it according to your will.

219
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:49,458
Just like this.

220
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:52,125
Just like slime.

221
00:12:52,125 --> 00:12:54,667
Normally one will have to
get used to controlling it.

222
00:12:54,667 --> 00:12:59,458
I, who have Ultimate Magic,
can control magic freely even at the beginning.

223
00:12:59,458 --> 00:13:01,292
You're so powerful!

224
00:13:01,292 --> 00:13:04,167
Lastly, cast spells.

225
00:13:04,167 --> 00:13:08,542
After choosing various magical skills,
you can cast spells automatically.

226
00:13:09,583 --> 00:13:12,458
Imagine magic like a pipe.

227
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:14,250
Over here...

228
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:15,583
Like this...

229
00:13:15,583 --> 00:13:18,792
After putting charm in it...

230
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:22,083
It becomes magic!

231
00:13:22,083 --> 00:13:24,583
Briefing complete.

232
00:13:24,583 --> 00:13:28,417
Let's defeat the big monster right away.

233
00:13:28,417 --> 00:13:31,292
Abyss Magic. Gate of Hell.

234
00:13:32,333 --> 00:13:36,875
I love fantasy. Whenever I think about
Abyss Magic, I get very excited!

235
00:13:36,875 --> 00:13:40,083
Okay. Cast spells.

236
00:13:40,083 --> 00:13:45,000
Odd. Why is it so hard to cast spells?

237
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:50,292
Even with Ultimate Magic
I can't control it at all.

238
00:13:50,292 --> 00:13:53,417
No. The magic is going to...

239
00:13:57,917 --> 00:14:00,292
How did this happen?

240
00:14:00,292 --> 00:14:03,583
Ultimate Magic is the highest level of magic.

241
00:14:03,583 --> 00:14:07,875
If I can't use it, no one in this world can.

242
00:14:07,875 --> 00:14:12,917
No. Although I have high ability values,
I'm a beginner in magic.

243
00:14:12,917 --> 00:14:15,333
From now on,
I have to work hard to put it into good use.

244
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:20,042
Alright. I want to study magic for now.

245
00:14:20,042 --> 00:14:26,208
You can't order the body arbitrarily
with the Wisdom.

246
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,375
Even if you don't allow,
I will practise the magic to its best.

247
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:33,917
Stop it!

248
00:14:33,917 --> 00:14:38,583
Let me go. Let me wear it.

249
00:14:38,583 --> 00:14:41,625
Proficiency achieved a certain target.

250
00:14:45,167 --> 00:14:47,542
I heard your conversation.

251
00:14:48,833 --> 00:14:51,208
Let me handle the magic.

252
00:14:54,458 --> 00:14:56,250
Another parallel will.

253
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:59,000
Thank you, the person in charge of magic.

254
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,792
I have a plan.

255
00:15:03,083 --> 00:15:07,125
Let the person in charge of magic
practise Abyss Magic.

256
00:15:07,125 --> 00:15:11,500
Then use magic additionally during battles.

257
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:15,167
Am I the strongest?

258
00:15:19,958 --> 00:15:21,833
What's going on?

259
00:15:21,833 --> 00:15:22,833
SICKLE OF DEATH. CONDITION OF EVOLUTION.
SMALL TARATECT FULFILLED CERTAIN ABILITY VALUE

260
00:15:22,833 --> 00:15:23,833
THE TITLE ASSASSIN IS OBTAINED.
A SYMBOL OF MISFORTUNE, FRIGHTENED BY PEOPLE.

261
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:24,917
SMALL TARATECT
WITH HIGH COMBAT AND HIDING SKILL

262
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:52,958
What's going on ahead?

263
00:15:56,667 --> 00:15:59,417
What's with the big hole?

264
00:16:11,083 --> 00:16:13,458
How did this happen?

265
00:16:13,458 --> 00:16:15,875
What's going on?

266
00:16:30,625 --> 00:16:32,250
REND, THE FIRE DRAGON. LEVEL 20.

267
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:34,542
The highest level of dragons.

268
00:16:35,292 --> 00:16:37,667
"HP value: 1700/3701"
It's injured.

269
00:16:41,833 --> 00:16:44,208
Its speed is faster than mine.

270
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:46,750
I don't think I can escape.

271
00:16:50,167 --> 00:16:52,750
It's angry.

272
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:55,583
Is it venting its anger on me?

273
00:16:55,583 --> 00:16:57,708
It was not my fault.

274
00:16:58,917 --> 00:17:01,958
Why am I so unlucky?

275
00:17:01,958 --> 00:17:03,625
Although it's badly *injured,

276
00:17:03,625 --> 00:17:06,375
its skills and ability values
are far better than mine.

277
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:09,041
Also it has a fatal skill that is bad for me.

278
00:17:09,041 --> 00:17:11,124
Abnormal state resistance.

279
00:17:12,958 --> 00:17:14,625
I have no chance to win against it.

280
00:17:14,625 --> 00:17:18,791
But since you want to pick a fight with me,
I shall fight you.

281
00:17:18,791 --> 00:17:21,582
I don't want to be killed as a vent of anger.

282
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:27,667
Since you want to fight, bring it on.

283
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,875
Magic power, air power. Activate dragon power.

284
00:17:32,875 --> 00:17:34,417
Activate Evil Eye.

285
00:17:34,417 --> 00:17:36,583
Begin to cast spells.

286
00:17:39,542 --> 00:17:41,583
It was a tentative strike,

287
00:17:41,583 --> 00:17:44,417
but I may be ashed if I were hit.

288
00:17:56,917 --> 00:17:59,333
His physical attack is already threatening.

289
00:17:59,333 --> 00:18:01,667
In addition to the fire attack...

290
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:08,833
It's tiring to dodge, think
and foresee at the same time.

291
00:18:16,792 --> 00:18:19,458
Evil Eye is no use against it.

292
00:18:22,708 --> 00:18:23,708
Although it's tricky,

293
00:18:23,708 --> 00:18:27,333
its injuries may be my chance of winning.

294
00:18:27,333 --> 00:18:32,083
Besides, it venting its anger
on me is unacceptable.

295
00:18:32,625 --> 00:18:35,375
Despite so, it has deadly attack,

296
00:18:35,375 --> 00:18:39,042
strong defense that resist normal attacks

297
00:18:39,917 --> 00:18:42,500
and speed that is faster than mine.

298
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,500
"ABNORMAL STATE RESISTANCE. LEVEL TWO."
Oh no!

299
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:48,708
I must inject the venom into its body
before it produces antibody.

300
00:18:48,708 --> 00:18:53,833
But even if I try my best to inject it,
I may most probably be stopped by the flames.

301
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:57,042
Nothing works!

302
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,208
Oh, right.

303
00:19:02,917 --> 00:19:04,583
Make weak venom.

304
00:19:10,125 --> 00:19:12,875
Great. I can block it...

305
00:19:13,542 --> 00:19:16,583
I can't land on such a surface.

306
00:19:23,208 --> 00:19:25,042
It's hot!

307
00:19:25,042 --> 00:19:27,042
As the saying goes, my butt is on fire.

308
00:19:27,042 --> 00:19:29,208
I can't move up to the ceiling in time.

309
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:42,958
The fireballs are traps.

310
00:19:42,958 --> 00:19:46,708
It forces me into the air
with nowhere to escape then kill me.

311
00:19:46,708 --> 00:19:48,375
Oh no!

312
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:49,667
It's not so bad.

313
00:19:49,667 --> 00:19:51,333
I've been waiting for this moment.

314
00:19:51,333 --> 00:19:53,833
Speed thinking.

315
00:19:53,833 --> 00:19:57,375
Use speed thinking
to delay the time of somatosensory.

316
00:19:57,375 --> 00:19:59,167
I shall use this gap...

317
00:19:59,167 --> 00:20:01,750
Okay. The moment when it opens its mouth...

318
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:04,667
The moment when there's no flame in its mouth.

319
00:20:05,667 --> 00:20:09,833
Huge spider venom!

320
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:10,792
The person in charge of magic.

321
00:20:10,792 --> 00:20:13,292
Please use venom magic accordingly.

322
00:20:13,292 --> 00:20:15,000
Leave it to me.

323
00:20:17,667 --> 00:20:18,792
The person in charge of body.

324
00:20:18,792 --> 00:20:19,958
Roger!

325
00:20:21,292 --> 00:20:23,583
Proficiency achieved a certain target.

326
00:20:23,583 --> 00:20:27,750
Parallel will skill is upgraded to level four.

327
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:29,417
Hey, we get along well!

328
00:20:29,417 --> 00:20:31,500
You're so noisy! It's not the time for this.

329
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,042
You silly!

330
00:20:38,042 --> 00:20:41,000
You can't escape this timing.

331
00:21:01,125 --> 00:21:03,208
This fellow is powerful.

332
00:21:03,208 --> 00:21:06,500
It realised instantly that
the ball of venom isn't good.

333
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:10,500
It actually stopped the ball
by letting it explode in its mouth.

334
00:21:23,167 --> 00:21:24,417
Do you know? This is the prelude.

335
00:21:24,417 --> 00:21:26,708
The life of a spider.

336
00:21:26,708 --> 00:21:28,292
I'm going to start singing.
