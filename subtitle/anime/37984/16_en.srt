1
00:00:00,917 --> 00:00:03,167
Evolution completed.

2
00:00:03,167 --> 00:00:06,417
Transformed into Zana Horowa.

3
00:00:06,417 --> 00:00:09,875
All the ability values have been upgraded.

4
00:00:09,875 --> 00:00:13,625
Skill proficiency upgrade is rewarded.

5
00:00:15,542 --> 00:00:21,708
I usually fall asleep during evolution.
This must be due to Exhaustion Nullification.

6
00:00:21,708 --> 00:00:23,958
Thank you so much.

7
00:00:23,958 --> 00:00:28,500
Immortality obtained due to the evolution.

8
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,708
Skill points obtained.

9
00:00:30,708 --> 00:00:34,958
Hold on. I think I heard something shocking.

10
00:00:34,958 --> 00:00:35,833
What is it?

11
00:00:35,833 --> 00:00:38,042
Skill point obtained.

12
00:00:38,042 --> 00:00:39,667
No. The sentence before.

13
00:00:39,667 --> 00:00:43,417
Immortality obtained due to evolution.

14
00:00:43,417 --> 00:00:47,542
Im... mortality?

15
00:00:48,333 --> 00:00:50,000
Are you sure?

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,917
Isn't this the ultimate cheating skill craved
by people all around since the ancient times?

17
00:00:58,042 --> 00:00:59,583
With this, I will surely win.

18
00:00:59,583 --> 00:01:03,417
No matter how I'm treated,

19
00:01:06,875 --> 00:01:08,833
I will not die.

20
00:01:08,833 --> 00:01:10,250
I will never die.

21
00:01:11,417 --> 00:01:14,708
That means I can even defeat mother.

22
00:01:14,708 --> 00:01:16,000
Hold on.

23
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,958
What is this?

24
00:01:17,958 --> 00:01:20,000
I almost missed this due to the excitement.

25
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,792
Title. Champion.

26
00:01:21,792 --> 00:01:24,625
It's not dentist, but champion.
(Attn: Champion and dentist have the same pronunciation)

27
00:01:24,625 --> 00:01:26,458
And there's also fear.

28
00:01:26,458 --> 00:01:29,417
Little spider, are you in distressed?

29
00:01:29,417 --> 00:01:34,500
No. It's too frightening.
I'm finally acknowledged. The Champion!

30
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:37,250
Acknowledged by whom?

31
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:39,750
By the admin, of course.

32
00:01:41,458 --> 00:01:43,125
This voice...

33
00:01:44,083 --> 00:01:47,042
Hello. I'm D.

34
00:01:47,042 --> 00:01:50,208

00:03:19,292 --> 00:03:24,208
Hello, can you hear me? I'm D.

57
00:03:24,208 --> 00:03:28,667
No. I can't hear you.

58
00:03:28,667 --> 00:03:33,667
How could it be? I have
a spider-self-explosion button in my hand.

59
00:03:33,667 --> 00:03:38,625
Hello. Sorry. Please forgive me.
Please don't press it. What button is that?

60
00:03:38,625 --> 00:03:44,292
I'm kidding. I don't have any button.
But I can easily turn a spider

61
00:03:44,292 --> 00:03:45,333
into dirty ashes.

62
00:03:45,333 --> 00:03:48,250
What?

63
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:49,542
Don't worry.

64
00:03:49,542 --> 00:03:54,333
I wouldn't let an interesting and funny person
like you die for nothing.

65
00:03:54,333 --> 00:03:56,833
Really? My pleasure.

66
00:03:59,375 --> 00:04:01,333
I shall go now.

67
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:02,333
Self-explosion.

68
00:04:02,333 --> 00:04:03,500
Sorry.

69
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:06,042
I'm just kidding.

70
00:04:06,042 --> 00:04:07,917
What's wrong with you?

71
00:04:07,917 --> 00:04:11,583
I just want to congratulate you
on achieving immortality.

72
00:04:13,042 --> 00:04:17,125
The setting of Zana Horowa
is an immortal monster.

73
00:04:17,125 --> 00:04:22,792
I didn't expect you to evolve to this.
What a surprise.

74
00:04:22,792 --> 00:04:24,292
Congratulations.

75
00:04:24,292 --> 00:04:28,292
You've become the world only special monster.

76
00:04:28,292 --> 00:04:30,375
Applause.

77
00:04:30,375 --> 00:04:33,000
What's your goal here?

78
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,042
Didn't I mention it? For amusement.

79
00:04:36,042 --> 00:04:42,167
But my mood is very good today.
I shall let you know more.

80
00:04:42,958 --> 00:04:44,875
Really?

81
00:04:44,875 --> 00:04:48,417
Let me ask you.
Why am I reincarnated into this world?

82
00:04:48,417 --> 00:04:50,125
Let me explain it.

83
00:04:50,125 --> 00:04:52,875
You passed away in Japan on earth.

84
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:55,750
I was dead indeed.

85
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:57,500
Why did I die?

86
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:01,875
It's because of
the ex-Warrior and the Devil King.

87
00:05:02,792 --> 00:05:11,375
These two geniuses of Dimensional Magic created
a magic that can cross the barrier of worlds.

88
00:05:11,375 --> 00:05:13,792
What is that? So powerful.

89
00:05:13,792 --> 00:05:20,375
Yes. But the system doesn't provide assistance
to skills that are beyond the system.

90
00:05:20,375 --> 00:05:26,750
They couldn't handle such a difficult magic.

91
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:29,042
Eventually the magic went out of control.

92
00:05:29,042 --> 00:05:36,875
At the destination, somewhere
in Japan on earth, an explosion occurred.

93
00:05:39,625 --> 00:05:41,583
The somewhere you mean...

94
00:05:41,583 --> 00:05:44,625
Yes. It was your high school classroom.

95
00:05:44,625 --> 00:05:46,750
What an unexpected disaster.

96
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:51,042
Indeed. Although it was
the mistake of the Warrior and Devil King,

97
00:05:51,042 --> 00:05:56,375
I had no choice but to overhaul
the system of another world which was abandoned.

98
00:05:56,375 --> 00:05:59,583
Abandoned after created? It's the creator's fault.

99
00:05:59,583 --> 00:06:03,417
Only admins can administrate this world.

100
00:06:03,417 --> 00:06:07,167
I'm just an outsider who provides the system.

101
00:06:07,167 --> 00:06:10,958
Although you said that,
I think you're in charge of a lot.

102
00:06:10,958 --> 00:06:18,708
That's because I can't let innocent high school
students die because of the system I created.

103
00:06:18,708 --> 00:06:21,042
High school students?

104
00:06:21,042 --> 00:06:26,625
Yes. 25 people in that class
died from the explosion.

105
00:06:26,625 --> 00:06:29,000
I guarded their souls,

106
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:34,500
let them keep their memories
of this world and gave them skills.

107
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:38,708
(n%I=W)
Then I gave each one of them appropriate skills.

108
00:06:38,708 --> 00:06:40,292
(SKANDA?)
I tried to have them

109
00:06:40,292 --> 00:06:43,958
reincarnate as races
that are similar to their soul waves.

110
00:06:44,792 --> 00:06:46,875
But I'm a spider.

111
00:06:46,875 --> 00:06:49,917
Because your wavelengths matched.

112
00:06:49,917 --> 00:06:52,875
Most of the others are reincarnated as humans.

113
00:06:52,875 --> 00:06:57,458
Why? I want to reincarnate as a human as well.

114
00:06:57,458 --> 00:07:04,375
But it isn't so bad
since you can fly off to start something.

115
00:07:04,375 --> 00:07:05,833
Flying?
(Attn: Flying could mean sneak off)

116
00:07:09,208 --> 00:07:12,375
Others are still babies.

117
00:07:12,375 --> 00:07:14,250
You mean sneak off.

118
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:17,750
You're born earlier than human.

119
00:07:19,417 --> 00:07:24,708
What you meant is, while others are
still learning to talk, I'm already a grown up.

120
00:07:25,542 --> 00:07:28,917
You mentioned 25 people have reincarnated.

121
00:07:28,917 --> 00:07:31,042
Yes, indeed.

122
00:07:31,042 --> 00:07:34,542
Aren't there supposed to be
26 people including the teacher?

123
00:07:34,542 --> 00:07:37,750
That's because I didn't reincarnate.

124
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:40,042
You were in the classroom as well?

125
00:07:40,042 --> 00:07:41,375
Who? What's your name?

126
00:07:41,375 --> 00:07:43,292
That's a secret.

127
00:07:44,708 --> 00:07:48,625
Forget about my name.
It was because I was there,

128
00:07:48,625 --> 00:07:52,708
the magic of Warrior and Devil King
is linked to the classroom.

129
00:07:52,708 --> 00:07:56,417
That means you're part of the culprit.

130
00:07:56,417 --> 00:08:00,042
I'm afraid they were trying to defeat me.

131
00:08:00,042 --> 00:08:01,292
Why?

132
00:08:01,292 --> 00:08:05,500
It seems a group of people
think the admins are the enemy.

133
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:10,583
I think the ex-Warrior
and Devil King were manipulated by them.

134
00:08:10,583 --> 00:08:12,667
They actually did such stupid things.

135
00:08:12,667 --> 00:08:17,792
That was it.
You're free to do anything after reincarnation.

136
00:08:17,792 --> 00:08:21,458
Let me keep adoring you from now on.

137
00:08:21,458 --> 00:08:22,875
No. Do not watch.

138
00:08:22,875 --> 00:08:26,500
I will pray for you to defeat her.

139
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:32,000
I hope you survive
so I can keep enjoying watching you.

140
00:08:33,292 --> 00:08:35,917
Yet another mystery.

141
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:48,708
This village is formed by
the businessmen and hotel hosts who cater people

142
00:08:48,708 --> 00:08:50,542
coming in and out of Great Elroe Labyrinth.

143
00:08:50,542 --> 00:08:54,708
When can I eventually come out?

144
00:08:54,708 --> 00:08:58,333
Bear with it awhile longer. You're eye-catching.

145
00:08:58,333 --> 00:09:00,667
Regarding this, I think...

146
00:09:00,667 --> 00:09:01,917
Here it is.

147
00:09:05,375 --> 00:09:07,833
Sorry. I will contact you later.

148
00:09:14,125 --> 00:09:17,208
How are you, Master Goyef.

149
00:09:18,917 --> 00:09:21,000
Mr. Hyrince.

150
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,083
This is the guide of the labyrinth,
Master Goyef.

151
00:09:24,083 --> 00:09:27,167
Julius and I were taken care by him.

152
00:09:27,167 --> 00:09:28,458
Brother...

153
00:09:28,458 --> 00:09:34,625
He's Julius' brother, Schlain,
who inherited Julius' place as the true Warrior.

154
00:09:34,625 --> 00:09:36,292
I'm Schlain.

155
00:09:39,208 --> 00:09:41,292
Come in first.

156
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:49,167
You want to head to Kasanagara Continent
via Great Elroe Labyrinth?

157
00:09:49,167 --> 00:09:55,750
Yes. The entrance of the labyrinth
is guarded by the imperial soldiers.

158
00:09:55,750 --> 00:10:00,292
You also know that we're wanted by the empire.

159
00:10:00,292 --> 00:10:06,833
But those are baseless charges.
We didn't attempt to overthrow the country.

160
00:10:07,667 --> 00:10:11,542
Can you bring us into the labyrinth?

161
00:10:11,542 --> 00:10:13,208
Please.

162
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:18,625
I'm sorry I can't help.

163
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:19,958
Master Goyef.

164
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:24,917
Of course I know you are innocent.

165
00:10:24,917 --> 00:10:25,833
Then why...

166
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:29,583
If I help you and become targeted by the empire,

167
00:10:29,583 --> 00:10:33,000
even my family will be in danger.

168
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,917
I'm truly sorry.

169
00:10:38,667 --> 00:10:41,875
Since this coward isn't willing to guide you...

170
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,667
Let me guide you there.

171
00:10:46,667 --> 00:10:47,958
Father.

172
00:10:47,958 --> 00:10:51,417
I'm the father of this coward, Basgath.

173
00:10:52,833 --> 00:10:56,958
If the people from the empire ask,
just say I was the one who made the decision.

174
00:10:56,958 --> 00:10:57,917
But...

175
00:10:59,042 --> 00:11:02,208
If you keep talking,
you'll get the Basgath's iron punch.

176
00:11:04,292 --> 00:11:09,417
If you don't mind this retired old man,
allow me to guide you, okay?

177
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:14,875
Thank you so much.

178
00:11:17,125 --> 00:11:20,208
Fei, when everything is ready
I will pick you up.

179
00:11:20,208 --> 00:11:23,333
Before that, can you get the teacher here?

180
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:25,417
The teacher. Why?

181
00:11:25,417 --> 00:11:27,167
Don't ask.

182
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:32,667
Teacher, Fei wants to talk to you.

183
00:11:32,667 --> 00:11:35,708
Me? What's going on?

184
00:11:35,708 --> 00:11:37,125
I don't know.

185
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,625
Has anyone here been into the labyrinth?

186
00:11:43,625 --> 00:11:45,542
No one else besides me...

187
00:11:45,542 --> 00:11:47,875
I've been in there once.

188
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:49,708
What a good lady.

189
00:11:50,875 --> 00:11:53,667
I'm going to Fei's for awhile.

190
00:11:54,917 --> 00:11:57,542
Katia, please come with me.

191
00:11:57,542 --> 00:11:59,208
Me?

192
00:11:59,208 --> 00:12:00,542
I want to go too.

193
00:12:00,542 --> 00:12:02,708
No, you can't.

194
00:12:03,625 --> 00:12:05,375
What?

195
00:12:08,333 --> 00:12:11,750
Here we are.

196
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:14,042
Walking is so tiring.

197
00:12:14,042 --> 00:12:16,583
Shun will surely be surprised.

198
00:12:20,042 --> 00:12:21,667
I'm back.

199
00:12:21,667 --> 00:12:23,000
You're so slow.

200
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,750
Shun, can we talk?

201
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,958
What's going on again?

202
00:12:31,958 --> 00:12:33,292
Did anything happen to Fei?

203
00:12:33,292 --> 00:12:35,250
Well, something did happen.

204
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:51,042
The grand introduction
of the human version of Fei.

205
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:55,000
Shinohara?

206
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,792
I knew this is how it would turn out.

207
00:12:56,792 --> 00:12:58,583
Are you shocked?

208
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:02,458
This is the effect of the latest skill.

209
00:13:02,458 --> 00:13:04,000
Humanise.

210
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:09,625
We bought all the clothes in the village.
It took so long because the size wasn't right.

211
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:14,292
That's why you didn't let me come along?

212
00:13:14,292 --> 00:13:19,875
That means when she's evolved
and was looking for clothes, she was nak...

213
00:13:19,875 --> 00:13:21,875
What are you thinking about?

214
00:13:21,875 --> 00:13:24,875
No. I wasn't thinking about something bad.

215
00:13:26,375 --> 00:13:29,500
But why couldn't I come along but Katia could?

216
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,375
It doesn't matter.

217
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:33,000
Katia was also a...

218
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,833
It doesn't matter.

219
00:13:34,833 --> 00:13:36,333
It doesn't matter?

220
00:13:39,458 --> 00:13:40,375
It suits you.

221
00:13:40,375 --> 00:13:44,250
Right? I'm very charming indeed.

222
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:46,167
Yo, pretty girl.

223
00:13:46,167 --> 00:13:49,542
-The inescapable fate even after reincarnation.
-After Fei is humanised,

224
00:13:49,542 --> 00:13:52,083
-It's called fate, but it's destined.
-she is becoming like Shinohara.

225
00:13:52,083 --> 00:13:53,208
Why are you staring at me?

226
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:54,708
-Why only Fei's appearance
-Oh, you guys.

227
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:56,875
is the same as her previous life?

228
00:13:56,875 --> 00:13:59,375
-I allow you to stare at me.
-Why indeed?

229
00:14:01,583 --> 00:14:02,792
Shun.

230
00:14:02,792 --> 00:14:08,625
I'm fine. Seeing Fei reminds me of Shinohara,

231
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:12,042
which makes me recognise that

232
00:14:12,042 --> 00:14:16,208
we have died once and are reincarnated.

233
00:14:20,875 --> 00:14:23,917
I wonder how the others are.

234
00:14:24,875 --> 00:14:30,667
Kogure Naofumi,
Sakurazaki Issei, Hayashi Kota

235
00:14:30,667 --> 00:14:34,000
and Wakaba Hiro...

236
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,500
Even in this world, we may not see them again.

237
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,833
Teacher, do you know how the others are?

238
00:14:44,833 --> 00:14:45,958
Yes.

239
00:14:45,958 --> 00:14:48,625
How are they?

240
00:14:48,625 --> 00:14:50,583
The person named Sophia...

241
00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:54,000
Something is better left unknown.

242
00:14:55,833 --> 00:15:01,208
Let me ask you. If Warrior is a reincarnation,
could the Devil King be one of our classmates?

243
00:15:01,208 --> 00:15:03,042
Who knows?

244
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:17,125
Very good. It seems everyone has a swimsuit.

245
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:20,083
Of course. I bought a very cute one.

246
00:15:20,083 --> 00:15:22,458
May I know what this is for?

247
00:15:22,458 --> 00:15:25,042
-I have to show my charm even in the water.
-Aren't we going to Great Elroe Labyrinth?

248
00:15:25,042 --> 00:15:27,333
-But it looks a little old school.
-Are we diving into the sea?

249
00:15:27,333 --> 00:15:33,542
Diving? What about this? I can fly you there.

250
00:15:33,542 --> 00:15:41,125
The sea is the water dragons' territory. They
destroy anything that flies and floats by.

251
00:15:41,125 --> 00:15:47,500
But there's an entrance to
Great Elroe Labyrinth at the sea bottom here.

252
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:51,083
We aren't crossing the sea
but diving to the bottom.

253
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:53,792
If you want to avoid the imperial soldiers,
this is the only way.

254
00:15:54,875 --> 00:15:58,500
Compared to water dragons,
the imperial soldiers are easier to deal with.

255
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:06,458
There are surely soldiers at the entrance,
but water dragons may not appear.

256
00:16:06,458 --> 00:16:09,500
In short, we're trying our luck.

257
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,792
Everyone knows how to swim, right?

258
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:19,917
I think I don't know how to swim.

259
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,292
I can't leave Fei here alone.

260
00:16:24,292 --> 00:16:26,417
I will help her dive.

261
00:16:26,417 --> 00:16:29,083
Fei, just keep swimming.

262
00:16:29,083 --> 00:16:30,500
You look so serious.

263
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:33,042
Okay, We'll leave Fei to Schlain.

264
00:16:34,083 --> 00:16:36,208
Okay. Let's go in full spirit.

265
00:16:38,583 --> 00:16:42,167
How would full spirit help? They're water dragons.

266
00:16:43,583 --> 00:16:45,625
I shall go first.

267
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:53,083
Let's go, Fei.

268
00:16:54,792 --> 00:16:58,542
1,2,3.

269
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:25,000
Cursed you.

270
00:17:54,958 --> 00:17:56,208
Shun.

271
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:02,667
-Shun.
-Shun.

272
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:44,000
Are you going to leave or not?

273
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:46,458
Sorry.

274
00:18:48,833 --> 00:18:52,250
Since you saved me, I'm not going to blame you.

275
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:54,667
Is everyone alright?

276
00:18:54,667 --> 00:18:56,792
Can't you tell?

277
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:03,250
Welcome to the hell of this world,
Great Elroe Labyrinth.

278
00:19:14,042 --> 00:19:16,333
It's the sea!

279
00:19:16,333 --> 00:19:18,583
Miami Ocean Resort.

280
00:19:19,583 --> 00:19:23,083
This curvy and hot body.

281
00:19:24,667 --> 00:19:27,000
And just keep floating.

282
00:19:28,042 --> 00:19:32,917
I from the previous life
could swim like a mermaid.

283
00:19:32,917 --> 00:19:36,875
No. Sorry, I lied.
I was a sports-idiot in my previous life.

284
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:39,583
SPORTS-IDIOT. SOMEONE WHO IS BAD IN SPORTS.
Annoying. That's not a skill.

285
00:19:41,208 --> 00:19:42,375
By the way...

286
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:47,750
That person was a classmate.

287
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:49,042
Who would it be?

288
00:19:49,042 --> 00:19:52,667
I pray for you to defeat her.

289
00:19:52,667 --> 00:19:58,125
I hope you survive
so I can keep enjoying watching.

290
00:19:59,292 --> 00:20:02,875
Regarding mother, I still need more time.

291
00:20:02,875 --> 00:20:07,625
Perhaps it would be better
after the parallel wills weaken her mentally.

292
00:20:07,625 --> 00:20:12,958
Before that, I will first deal with
the subordinates of mother.

293
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,833
Fishing is great. I can think meanwhile.

294
00:20:21,625 --> 00:20:23,792
It's coming. It seems to be a big fish.

295
00:20:23,792 --> 00:20:26,000
What is that? Is it something like a swordfish?

296
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:32,167
It's a tuna!

297
00:20:35,542 --> 00:20:38,125
There should be a limit to a big fish, right?

298
00:20:38,125 --> 00:20:39,833
Water dragon?

299
00:20:40,875 --> 00:20:44,500
Looking back on me
who fought with countless dragons,

300
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:51,083
Rend, Araba...
All of you were defeated with honour.

301
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:54,042
As a successor dragon, is that even appropriate?

302
00:21:00,375 --> 00:21:06,625
Dream on. Don't look down upon a spider
who defeated fire dragons and earth dragons.

303
00:21:09,292 --> 00:21:15,333
I recall now. Compared to fishing,
I have something more important to do.

304
00:21:15,333 --> 00:21:16,167
TELEPORT

305
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:18,875
First of all, this Puppet Taratect.

306
00:21:18,875 --> 00:21:23,542
Our battle hasn't ended yet.

307
00:21:24,833 --> 00:21:27,333
Hold on.

308
00:21:27,333 --> 00:21:29,750
I told you to hold on.

309
00:21:32,917 --> 00:21:34,208
What a tricky one.

310
00:21:34,208 --> 00:21:37,333
This is the time to use wisdom.

311
00:21:37,958 --> 00:21:41,917
Come on. Miami Ocean Resort.

312
00:21:41,917 --> 00:21:44,292
You said I may drown as well?

313
00:21:44,292 --> 00:21:46,125
Don't worry.

314
00:21:49,208 --> 00:21:51,208
I will float.

315
00:21:51,208 --> 00:21:56,125
Besides, I'm immortal.

316
00:21:57,625 --> 00:21:59,125
I will win.

317
00:21:59,125 --> 00:22:01,875
As long as I keep
weakening mother's combat power,

318
00:22:01,875 --> 00:22:02,958
I can win.

319
00:22:02,958 --> 00:22:05,833
Because I'm the Champion.

320
00:22:05,833 --> 00:22:07,792
Champion!

321
00:22:10,667 --> 00:22:16,208
In order to calm my combating restless heart,
I have to keep fishing.

322
00:22:16,208 --> 00:22:17,625
Finally connected!

323
00:22:17,625 --> 00:22:18,667
You scared me!

324
00:22:19,375 --> 00:22:22,042
The person in charge of magic No. 1,
long time no see.

325
00:22:22,042 --> 00:22:23,333
Run now, hurry.

326
00:22:23,333 --> 00:22:24,792
Why so sudden?

327
00:22:24,792 --> 00:22:27,667
Monsters are heading your direction.

328
00:22:27,667 --> 00:22:28,458
Mother?

329
00:22:28,458 --> 00:22:33,917
No. We misunderstood. We thought
mother is the strongest, but that was wrong.

330
00:22:33,917 --> 00:22:35,875
There's someone more powerful than mother.

331
00:22:35,875 --> 00:22:38,625
What? I don't understand.

332
00:22:43,167 --> 00:22:44,292
What?

333
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:52,792
It wasn't teleporting just now.
Something was coming in high speed.

334
00:22:54,625 --> 00:22:55,875
Identification.

335
00:22:55,875 --> 00:22:58,000
"IDENTIFICATION WAS HINDERED"
Seriously?

336
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,875
Activate Wisdom.

337
00:22:59,875 --> 00:23:01,375
ORIGIN TARATECT. LEVEL 139.
NAME: ARIEL

338
00:23:01,375 --> 00:23:03,833
Title?

339
00:23:03,833 --> 00:23:06,667
An ancient monster?

340
00:23:06,667 --> 00:23:07,917
Devil King?

341
00:23:07,917 --> 00:23:09,750
What's the matter with this title?

342
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:12,917
It's better to not know it.

343
00:23:12,917 --> 00:23:15,458
Oh no. I'm screwed!

344
00:23:15,458 --> 00:23:20,000
No, listen to me. I'm not hostile.

345
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,500
You get it?

346
00:23:24,125 --> 00:23:25,458
This is bad. Run!

347
00:23:29,625 --> 00:23:33,417
It's too late!

348
00:23:33,417 --> 00:23:36,333
SO I'M A SPIDER, SO WHAT?

349
00:23:36,333 --> 00:23:39,000
NEXT EPISODE: WHAT AM I DOING?

350
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,458
STAY TUNED
