1
00:00:09,583 --> 00:00:12,958
What is Ohts thinking?

2
00:00:12,958 --> 00:00:14,833
They should know
if the transaction is restricted,

3
00:00:14,833 --> 00:00:20,417
not only the allied countries will be troubled,
but also themselves.

4
00:00:20,417 --> 00:00:23,083
You couldn't meet the king?

5
00:00:23,083 --> 00:00:27,542
They kept saying he's busy with work
and didn't want to see me at all.

6
00:00:27,542 --> 00:00:32,583
That means they still want to restrict
businessmen from entering and leaving Ohts?

7
00:00:33,833 --> 00:00:37,375
That was too hasty. What actually happened?

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,833
Be good. Did it scare you?

9
00:00:46,833 --> 00:00:47,917
I'm sorry.

10
00:00:47,917 --> 00:00:49,833
Don't be scared now.

11
00:00:51,792 --> 00:00:54,292
It's okay.

12
00:00:54,292 --> 00:00:59,000
Such a good child.

Mother is really hard to deal with.

00:02:35,125 --> 00:02:41,792
You're not those parents who can get
their children back by just saying a word.

37
00:02:45,417 --> 00:02:50,208
In short, I will pass the matter
of mother to them.

38
00:02:50,208 --> 00:02:51,958
Watch! The Best Team.

39
00:02:51,958 --> 00:02:54,042
No need to show the team's victory pose.

40
00:02:54,875 --> 00:03:01,958
Although it was annoying to nag each of them,
I feel lonely when they're not around.

41
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:05,458
Human beings are selfish.

42
00:03:05,458 --> 00:03:07,917
I'm just kidding. I'm not a human.

43
00:03:07,917 --> 00:03:11,417
Yes. I will continue my lonely journey.

44
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,708
Protect the carriage.

45
00:03:14,708 --> 00:03:16,167
Strengthen the defence of door.

46
00:03:16,167 --> 00:03:16,958
Where are the enemies?

47
00:03:16,958 --> 00:03:18,167
There are three of them.

48
00:03:18,167 --> 00:03:19,708
Here they come. The other three.

49
00:03:19,708 --> 00:03:22,333
Oh no, I ran into humans.

50
00:03:26,042 --> 00:03:27,833
Are they fighting?

51
00:03:28,792 --> 00:03:31,375
-They encountered robbers.
-Kill the horses!

52
00:03:32,083 --> 00:03:33,417
What should I do?

53
00:03:33,417 --> 00:03:38,625
It's not good to get involved.
I don't want to draw attention.

54
00:03:38,625 --> 00:03:41,792
But I feel horrible pretending not to see this.

55
00:03:41,792 --> 00:03:46,042
But so what if I can help humans? I'm a monster.

56
00:03:46,042 --> 00:03:50,375
Perhaps they will point
the knives at me afterwards.

57
00:03:50,375 --> 00:03:54,458
Let's just deal with the robbers
when everyone of the carriage is killed.

58
00:03:54,458 --> 00:03:58,292
Because humans are
more experienced than monsters.

59
00:03:58,292 --> 00:04:04,625
I don't want to kill common folks,
but killing robbers should be fine.

60
00:04:04,625 --> 00:04:07,625
I can even increase my experience value so.
I will be very happy.

61
00:04:07,625 --> 00:04:12,333
When the annoying robbers are eliminated,
the folks will be happy as well.

62
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:16,833
Besides, I've eaten the human
who burnt down my house in the labyrinth.

63
00:04:16,833 --> 00:04:19,791
It was indescribably delicious!

64
00:04:19,791 --> 00:04:21,957
Nice, handsome.

65
00:04:21,958 --> 00:04:24,417
Isn't this nice, handsome?

66
00:04:26,292 --> 00:04:29,000
However, I don't expect much from them.

67
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:31,875
There's a baby.

68
00:04:34,333 --> 00:04:36,417
Master, please run!

69
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,500
Mira Songfy!

70
00:04:54,208 --> 00:04:57,583
There's no choice but to help them.

71
00:04:57,583 --> 00:04:58,917
Mon...ster!

72
00:04:58,917 --> 00:05:00,750
I've never seen it before.

73
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:02,458
The chief was...

74
00:05:10,542 --> 00:05:11,833
Run!

75
00:05:14,417 --> 00:05:15,625
Help!

76
00:05:27,125 --> 00:05:29,500
Okay. Everyone is eliminated.

77
00:05:31,083 --> 00:05:34,792
If only I were a prince or a knight...

78
00:05:38,542 --> 00:05:40,833
Are you hurt?

79
00:05:42,917 --> 00:05:45,083
That feels odd.

80
00:05:49,375 --> 00:05:52,833
Okay, I will do you another favour.

81
00:06:06,917 --> 00:06:10,125
I should leave now.

82
00:06:11,542 --> 00:06:13,750
Madam, danger!

83
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:20,417
Hold on. What's your name?

84
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,917
I'm just a passing spider.

85
00:06:23,917 --> 00:06:24,917
What's the matter?

86
00:06:27,833 --> 00:06:32,708
Isn't that the baby who was crying just now?
How are you?

87
00:06:32,708 --> 00:06:34,958
VAMPIRE. LEVEL ONE.
SOPHIA KEREN.

88
00:06:34,958 --> 00:06:36,208
Vampire?

89
00:06:36,208 --> 00:06:37,625
Besides, her name is...

90
00:06:37,625 --> 00:06:39,750
What? What is this?

91
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:42,083
Negishi Shouko? What does this mean?

92
00:06:42,083 --> 00:06:46,208
I'm confused. I need some time to digest this.

93
00:06:50,125 --> 00:06:55,167
"Sophia Keren" is read as
"Negishi Shouko" in this world?

94
00:06:55,167 --> 00:06:57,333
No, that's impossible.

95
00:06:57,333 --> 00:07:02,583
Besides, how will I know if it's read
as shouko or akiko just by looking at the name?

96
00:07:02,583 --> 00:07:05,208
Could it be read as "Appeal Akiko"?
(Appeal Akiko and Negishi Shouko have a similar pronunciation)

97
00:07:05,208 --> 00:07:07,208
No, that's even more confusing.

98
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,333
Could she be a reincarnation?

99
00:07:12,917 --> 00:07:15,375
I'm also reincarnated here.

100
00:07:15,375 --> 00:07:18,542
It's not surprising
even if there are other reincarnations.

101
00:07:18,542 --> 00:07:20,167
But this is too cunning.

102
00:07:20,167 --> 00:07:22,917
Why is she a vampire yet I'm a spider?

103
00:07:22,917 --> 00:07:26,542
Furthermore, she's already adorable as a baby.

104
00:07:26,542 --> 00:07:30,125
When she grows, she will be an adorable vampire.

105
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:32,083
Hold on. This is too awesome.

106
00:07:32,083 --> 00:07:34,875
This is how I looked like when I was born.

107
00:07:34,875 --> 00:07:37,958
I may look like this when I grow up.

108
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:42,583
This is too cunning, too much and too biased!

109
00:07:42,583 --> 00:07:44,917
How can reincarnation be so biased?

110
00:07:46,917 --> 00:07:54,458
Alright! Use your charming vampire appearance
to go on with your blood-sucking vampire life!

111
00:07:54,458 --> 00:07:57,333
After all I'm just...

112
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:07,292
Alright. Human is human. Spider is spider.

113
00:08:10,542 --> 00:08:13,000
INVESTIGATION

114
00:08:16,792 --> 00:08:21,292
The carriage isn't moving.
Seems like it was attacked by robbers.

115
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:22,708
Where is the baby?

116
00:08:22,708 --> 00:08:24,292
She's fine.

117
00:08:24,292 --> 00:08:25,625
That's good.

118
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:28,042
They are...

119
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
elves!

120
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,417
The iconic race of fantasy has appeared!

121
00:08:33,417 --> 00:08:36,042
Catch the baby alive.

122
00:08:36,042 --> 00:08:37,542
What about the rest?

123
00:08:37,542 --> 00:08:39,833
Not needed. Kill.

124
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:56,875
Although I'm envious that she's a vampire,

125
00:08:56,875 --> 00:09:01,625
the child is involved in her own trouble.

126
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:05,542
No matter where we are, it's hard to survive.

127
00:09:13,708 --> 00:09:15,208
I'm coming in.

128
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:22,833
It's Schlain. What's the matter?

129
00:09:22,833 --> 00:09:26,542
Didn't you ask for me, father?

130
00:09:26,542 --> 00:09:28,542
I asked for you?

131
00:09:28,542 --> 00:09:31,292
Yes. Sue...

132
00:09:31,292 --> 00:09:34,583
I didn't ask for you.

133
00:09:34,583 --> 00:09:39,667
But I heard that you told me to come
to the office to discuss something.

134
00:09:45,542 --> 00:09:49,375
Father... Sue...

135
00:10:06,542 --> 00:10:09,167
Sue, what are you doing?

136
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:13,042
Brother, what are you doing?

137
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:17,750
What happened?

138
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:20,333
Brother did that to father...

139
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:23,333
What did you say? Schlain, are you insane?

140
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:25,292
No, it wasn't me!

141
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:29,208
Guards, take Schlain down.

142
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:38,750
Hey, you asked for this, Mr. Warrior.

143
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:43,417
This voice... Is this Hugo?

144
00:10:46,167 --> 00:10:47,500
You're right.

145
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:51,042
Don't expose yourself, Hugo.

146
00:10:51,042 --> 00:10:55,000
What does it matter?
This is his last present before he dies.

147
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,917
Brother Cylis, what's going on?

148
00:11:00,792 --> 00:11:05,417
Are you frightened? Inexplicable?

149
00:11:05,417 --> 00:11:11,583
Your brother wants to inherit the throne
and I want to revenge on you and Oka.

150
00:11:11,583 --> 00:11:15,042
So we think you're in the way.

151
00:11:15,042 --> 00:11:21,042
Why? You're already the next king.

152
00:11:21,042 --> 00:11:27,542
No. Father wants you to be the next king.

153
00:11:27,542 --> 00:11:32,875
He thought if he declared you as
the next king before you're declared a warrior,

154
00:11:32,875 --> 00:11:39,458
you wouldn't be able to simply
go to the battlefield as Warrior.

155
00:11:39,458 --> 00:11:43,208
How can I let you grab the throne
with such dirty methods?

156
00:11:43,208 --> 00:11:48,583
So we collaborated.
Besides, it's not just your brother and I.

157
00:11:51,458 --> 00:11:55,167
Brother, I'm sorry. Die.

158
00:11:55,167 --> 00:11:57,958
Sue, why?

159
00:11:57,958 --> 00:12:00,583
I just felt what true love is.

160
00:12:00,583 --> 00:12:05,917
For the sake of love, I don't mind killing you.

161
00:12:05,917 --> 00:12:07,458
Sue...

162
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:12,000
"HYPNOTISED. BRAINWASHED. SEDUCED."
You saw it through?

163
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,708
Yes, I did it.

164
00:12:14,708 --> 00:12:18,167
How's the feeling of having
something taken away from you?

165
00:12:18,167 --> 00:12:19,333
Can't reconcile yourself?

166
00:12:19,333 --> 00:12:22,333
I've been through it so I understand it.

167
00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:29,000
Restore Sue back to her original state!

168
00:12:30,792 --> 00:12:32,333
Rotter!

169
00:12:37,667 --> 00:12:39,667
I didn't expect you to be working so hard.

170
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:52,417
Sophia!

171
00:12:58,333 --> 00:12:59,333
IDENTIFICATION

172
00:12:59,333 --> 00:13:00,750
"IDENTIFICATION HINDERED"
What?

173
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:03,958
Identification hindered?
There's actually such a skill?

174
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:06,500
Sophia, don't stop me.

175
00:13:07,583 --> 00:13:09,708
He's my prey.

176
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:13,625
How dare you say that after being hit by him?

177
00:13:13,625 --> 00:13:15,375
Kill him quickly.

178
00:13:15,375 --> 00:13:18,000
Farewell, Mr. Warrior!

179
00:13:22,625 --> 00:13:23,542
Dream on!

180
00:13:24,208 --> 00:13:26,250
Oka!

181
00:13:31,083 --> 00:13:32,750
You are...

182
00:13:35,417 --> 00:13:37,875
Shun, run!

183
00:13:37,875 --> 00:13:39,458
Hold on, Oka.

184
00:13:40,167 --> 00:13:42,167
Don't let them escape! Chase!

185
00:13:44,708 --> 00:13:47,667
Teacher, Sue! I can't leave Sue!

186
00:13:47,667 --> 00:13:50,208
No, we need to retreat now.

187
00:13:50,208 --> 00:13:51,500
But...

188
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:52,833
Mr. Schlain.

189
00:13:53,667 --> 00:13:55,708
Brother Hyrince. Anna.

190
00:13:55,708 --> 00:14:00,667
Shun, I know you're confused.
But it's best to escape now. Let's go.

191
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:04,833
Come on.

192
00:14:07,417 --> 00:14:08,750
Sue...

193
00:14:12,042 --> 00:14:14,917
What's going on?

194
00:14:14,917 --> 00:14:16,000
Rebellion.

195
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,333
Rebellion?

196
00:14:17,333 --> 00:14:20,750
The main culprits are
the first prince, Cylis and Hugo.

197
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:28,083
But they want to blame it on you and pretend
to be those who suppressed the rebellion.

198
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:32,167
Those who are fighting
the guards now are Leston's troop.

199
00:14:52,083 --> 00:14:53,792
Brother Leston.

200
00:14:56,458 --> 00:14:59,167
Shun, now is the time. Let's hurry.

201
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:19,458
The church has announced the new Warrior?

202
00:15:19,458 --> 00:15:23,000
Yes. It's Hugo Baint Renxandt.

203
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,917
Hugo? How is that possible?

204
00:15:25,917 --> 00:15:28,292
The church is also their accomplice.

205
00:15:29,833 --> 00:15:33,792
Why is the church taking such a stupid risk?

206
00:15:33,792 --> 00:15:36,708
Oka, do you have an idea?

207
00:15:36,708 --> 00:15:42,583
I guess, Hugo has most probably
brainwashed the people of the church.

208
00:15:42,583 --> 00:15:46,958
How is it possible?
The effect of brainwashing is temporary.

209
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:49,083
It's impossible to have caused this.

210
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:54,375
It's a different story if he has the highest
skills of the seven deadly sins, Lust.

211
00:15:54,375 --> 00:15:57,500
Its effect of brainwashing
is of a different level.

212
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,625
You mean Hugo has this skill?

213
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:02,667
It's best to assume that
this country can no longer be saved.

214
00:16:02,667 --> 00:16:05,583
If we find a way to deal with Hugo,
maybe there's still hope.

215
00:16:05,583 --> 00:16:06,875
It's useless.

216
00:16:13,667 --> 00:16:18,542
As long as Sophia is around,
we will have no chance of winning.

217
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:26,292
Sophia... Who is that woman?

218
00:16:29,208 --> 00:16:30,667
Oh no!

219
00:16:30,667 --> 00:16:31,958
We're surrounded.

220
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:33,708
Let's break through it.

221
00:16:33,708 --> 00:16:39,792
Shun, use my sword.
A sword passed down in the royal family.

222
00:16:39,792 --> 00:16:42,500
As the Warrior,
it's more fitting for you to use it.

223
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,500
Okay.

224
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:44,750
Let's go.

225
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:46,417
That's useless.

226
00:16:47,625 --> 00:16:51,375
You're not giving up, Shun.

227
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:56,583
Katia... Even you...

228
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:02,583
Katia!

229
00:17:02,583 --> 00:17:03,875
"HYPNOTISED. SEDUCED. BRAINWASHED."
Be gone!

230
00:17:03,875 --> 00:17:05,375
Cursed you!

231
00:17:06,583 --> 00:17:08,750
Interesting.

232
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:10,042
Silly!

233
00:17:13,083 --> 00:17:16,708
What are you thinking?
Soldiers can get injured too.

234
00:17:16,708 --> 00:17:20,041
What an amazing person.
You even care about the enemy's soldiers.

235
00:17:20,041 --> 00:17:22,416
Katia, be conscious!

236
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:25,749
Stop talking so much. I'm conscious.

237
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:29,333
A rebel should be punished like a rebel.

238
00:17:29,333 --> 00:17:31,458
You silly!

239
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:33,042
Katia!

240
00:17:44,417 --> 00:17:46,125
Kanata!

241
00:17:47,625 --> 00:17:49,167
Shun...

242
00:17:53,792 --> 00:17:55,208
Katia.

243
00:18:01,792 --> 00:18:02,917
Shun.

244
00:18:02,917 --> 00:18:04,208
Mr. Schlain.

245
00:18:15,625 --> 00:18:17,667
Shun...

246
00:18:17,667 --> 00:18:21,125
Shun, I...

247
00:18:21,125 --> 00:18:23,542
Katia, are you conscious now?

248
00:18:23,542 --> 00:18:26,042
Shun, I've not recovered.

249
00:18:26,042 --> 00:18:27,958
Hurry, stab me!

250
00:18:27,958 --> 00:18:30,083
Lest I will attack you again.

251
00:18:30,083 --> 00:18:31,417
Katia...

252
00:18:33,833 --> 00:18:36,583
Hurry, Shun! Hurry!

253
00:18:37,542 --> 00:18:39,000
How can I?

254
00:18:44,417 --> 00:18:46,375
Katia!

255
00:18:47,458 --> 00:18:48,583
Shun!

256
00:18:50,375 --> 00:18:53,625
Katia, Katia! What did you do?

257
00:18:53,625 --> 00:18:55,458
Mr. Schlain.

258
00:18:55,458 --> 00:18:58,333
Katia, no!

259
00:18:59,208 --> 00:19:01,500
Don't die, Katia.

260
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:04,458
Ms. Katia is...

261
00:19:04,458 --> 00:19:08,458
No, don't die!

262
00:19:08,458 --> 00:19:09,833
Katia!

263
00:19:11,458 --> 00:19:12,792
No.

264
00:19:12,792 --> 00:19:16,667
Katia!

265
00:19:22,875 --> 00:19:26,083
Katia, open your eyes. Katia.

266
00:19:27,292 --> 00:19:28,917
Shun...

267
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,583
You're awake.

268
00:19:33,417 --> 00:19:35,458
You silly.

269
00:19:38,083 --> 00:19:40,500
Anna, please take care of Katia.

270
00:19:49,083 --> 00:19:53,542
Since Katia is conscious again,
I don't have to show mercy anymore.

271
00:20:02,333 --> 00:20:03,750
You...

272
00:20:05,083 --> 00:20:09,042
How are you? Here, this is your present.

273
00:20:12,833 --> 00:20:15,292
Potimas.

274
00:20:18,167 --> 00:20:20,083
This tastes horrible.

275
00:20:20,083 --> 00:20:24,042
Does corrupted nature make blood taste bad?

276
00:20:24,042 --> 00:20:26,833
Could you be Negishi...

277
00:20:26,833 --> 00:20:29,958
Didn't I mention to not call me by that name?

278
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:35,500
Don't tell me not to kill.

279
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:38,500
Didn't you also kill many people?

280
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,958
This is not Japan after all.

281
00:20:41,917 --> 00:20:44,250
You're a reincarnation?

282
00:20:45,333 --> 00:20:48,667
You want to fight me? Save it.

283
00:20:48,667 --> 00:20:52,750
Because Master told me not to fight the teacher.

284
00:20:55,417 --> 00:20:57,542
This is legitimate defence.

285
00:20:57,542 --> 00:20:59,250
I was forced to do this.

286
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:01,292
It's not my fault.

287
00:21:01,292 --> 00:21:04,417
Doesn't magic work?

288
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:16,958
Teacher!

289
00:21:22,042 --> 00:21:23,958
Just give up.

290
00:21:27,583 --> 00:21:31,000
Healing magic can't be used.

291
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:33,458
Shun...

292
00:21:35,833 --> 00:21:37,542
Cursed you!

293
00:21:37,542 --> 00:21:40,417
A gorgeous debut in the times of crisis.

294
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,167
Fei.

295
00:21:56,167 --> 00:21:59,292
Heroes always come late.

296
00:21:59,292 --> 00:22:03,250
Your look. Are those wings?

297
00:22:04,333 --> 00:22:08,833
I just awakened and hatched,
so I don't know what's going on.

298
00:22:08,833 --> 00:22:11,708
But you're in danger now, right?

299
00:22:11,708 --> 00:22:14,083
Yes. I'm saved.

300
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:17,042
Shun, escape with the dragon.

301
00:22:17,042 --> 00:22:18,875
Do you think you can escape?

302
00:22:21,083 --> 00:22:23,500
Even if we can't escape, we will.

303
00:22:34,625 --> 00:22:37,625
Brother Leston!

304
00:23:00,917 --> 00:23:03,583
Why did it become like this?

305
00:23:06,125 --> 00:23:07,833
How did it go?

306
00:23:07,833 --> 00:23:12,125
It was successful. The goal is achieved.

307
00:23:12,125 --> 00:23:15,125
Poor Yamada.

308
00:23:15,125 --> 00:23:16,667
What does it matter?

309
00:23:16,667 --> 00:23:20,875
He has been in a peaceful country
and had a relaxing life.

310
00:23:20,875 --> 00:23:23,625
He should suffer a little like I did.

311
00:23:23,625 --> 00:23:29,000
Yes. As long as the plan isn't affected.
Thank you.

312
00:23:29,542 --> 00:23:31,750
Your order will be obeyed,

313
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:33,458
Devil.

314
00:23:36,333 --> 00:23:39,000
SO I'M A SPIDER, SO WHAT?
NEXT EPISODE: MOTHER AND TRICKY HUMANOID SPIDER

315
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,458
STAY TUNED
