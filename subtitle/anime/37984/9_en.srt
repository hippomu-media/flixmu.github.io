1
00:00:06,167 --> 00:00:08,875
Brother, running at the corridor is not allowed.

2
00:00:08,875 --> 00:00:09,833
I know.

3
00:00:09,833 --> 00:00:12,250
He's not listening.

4
00:00:30,542 --> 00:00:32,000
Brother Julius.

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,042
EPISODE 9: I CAN'T SPEAK, ISEKAIGO?

6
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:57,958

SO I'M A SPIDER, SO WHAT?

30
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,958
Shun, long time no see.

31
00:02:08,958 --> 00:02:10,208
Yes.

32
00:02:10,208 --> 00:02:12,208
Brother Hyrince, long time no see.

33
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,125
We haven't met for awhile. You've grown.

34
00:02:17,125 --> 00:02:19,250
Sue, how are you?

35
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:20,875
Yes.

36
00:02:20,875 --> 00:02:23,000
You look tired, Sue.

37
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,500
What happened?

38
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:26,625
I'm fine.

39
00:02:27,333 --> 00:02:28,625
Don't mind it.

40
00:02:28,625 --> 00:02:33,250
Shun, take good care of our sister.

41
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:36,833
I don't know when I will be back next time.

42
00:02:37,333 --> 00:02:40,792
I have to go to the Empire.

43
00:02:40,792 --> 00:02:42,167
To the Empire?

44
00:02:42,167 --> 00:02:44,792
The Demon Clan is behaving abnormally.

45
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:49,583
Depending on the situation,
we might have a war with the Demon Clan.

46
00:02:50,708 --> 00:02:54,250
Brother, please be careful.

47
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:56,000
Don't worry about me.

48
00:02:57,625 --> 00:03:02,167
No matter what happens,
I will protect him as his backup.

49
00:03:04,625 --> 00:03:06,833
Shun, is that...

50
00:03:06,833 --> 00:03:08,583
Yes, she's Fei.

51
00:03:08,583 --> 00:03:09,875
That's surprising.

52
00:03:09,875 --> 00:03:12,208
I didn't expect her to have grown so much.

53
00:03:15,583 --> 00:03:20,333
We were attacked by an earth dragon awhile ago,
fortunately Fei rescued us.

54
00:03:23,042 --> 00:03:27,042
I see. Thank you for protecting Shun.

55
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:31,375
What an incredible fate.

56
00:03:32,167 --> 00:03:38,167
The things found at the same place
are now each by my and Shun's side.

57
00:03:39,083 --> 00:03:42,417
That scarf was left behind by mother, right?

58
00:03:42,417 --> 00:03:46,500
Yes, she made it for me
not long before her death.

59
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:49,583
It's made of taratect's spider silks.

60
00:03:50,458 --> 00:03:51,917
Silks of taratects?

61
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:56,917
It's said,
silks of taratects are made with skills.

62
00:03:56,917 --> 00:04:00,708
You can't obtain it
even by dissecting their bodies.

63
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:02,125
Why do you have it?

64
00:04:03,042 --> 00:04:06,042
This happened about 15 years ago.

65
00:04:06,042 --> 00:04:10,125
Some explorers brought it back once.

66
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:12,583
After burning the nest of the taratects,

67
00:04:12,583 --> 00:04:16,541
a few eggs of spider silks were left behind.

68
00:04:16,541 --> 00:04:19,916
It's said they can be sold for a high price.

69
00:04:19,916 --> 00:04:24,792
They also obtained a dragon egg from the nest.

70
00:04:24,792 --> 00:04:26,917
Where is the egg now?

71
00:04:26,917 --> 00:04:28,917
Sorry, we can't stay for long.

72
00:04:28,917 --> 00:04:31,292
Julius, time to go.

73
00:04:31,292 --> 00:04:32,750
I get it.

74
00:04:36,292 --> 00:04:40,417
Do we have to go to war with Demon Clan anyway?

75
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:46,792
It would of course be good
if we can settle it without wars.

76
00:04:47,625 --> 00:04:54,042
But if they try to challenge our peace,
we have to fight back.

77
00:04:54,042 --> 00:04:56,375
This is the reality.

78
00:04:56,375 --> 00:04:57,500
However,

79
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:03,083
if we keep using this as an excuse,
we will never improve.

80
00:05:03,083 --> 00:05:05,417
The important aim is

81
00:05:05,417 --> 00:05:11,375
to create a world with laughter and peace.
This is the dream I'm pursuing.

82
00:05:13,083 --> 00:05:14,708
Until death stops me.

83
00:05:14,708 --> 00:05:16,125
Brother.

84
00:05:16,833 --> 00:05:20,458
I will see you when this is settled.

85
00:05:20,458 --> 00:05:22,125
That's a promise.

86
00:05:55,708 --> 00:05:57,042
A flaw is found.

87
00:06:00,583 --> 00:06:02,042
Take this!

88
00:06:02,042 --> 00:06:03,917
Spider venom bomb!

89
00:06:03,917 --> 00:06:06,792
Added with a lot of anesthesia.

90
00:06:06,792 --> 00:06:09,292
In addition to...

91
00:06:09,292 --> 00:06:13,000
corrosive attack!

92
00:06:21,958 --> 00:06:24,083
The strongest double attack.

93
00:06:30,333 --> 00:06:32,667
Corrosive attack is indeed powerful.

94
00:06:32,667 --> 00:06:35,667
I lost an arm because of the backlash.

95
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:43,500
Defeated it... successfully.

96
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:47,708
It doesn't even know what happened.

97
00:06:50,083 --> 00:06:51,042
"LEVEL SIX GAIDO MAGIC, FANTASY."
Fantasy.

98
00:06:51,042 --> 00:06:54,000
Literally, an illusion like a fantasy.

99
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,833
One of the joker cards
that I've always tried to use.

100
00:06:58,833 --> 00:07:02,208
A magic that makes
the opponent see illusion.

101
00:07:02,208 --> 00:07:06,875
You saw the illusion I created and
thought I fell onto the ground.

102
00:07:06,875 --> 00:07:08,958
Hence you spit flame.

103
00:07:08,958 --> 00:07:12,583
I wanted to escape
after casting the Fantasy spell.

104
00:07:12,583 --> 00:07:15,250
However, I can't just escape half way.

105
00:07:16,208 --> 00:07:18,458
Or else, no matter when,

106
00:07:18,458 --> 00:07:22,000
I will be like how I was
when my home was burnt down.

107
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,167
I must raise my head and live bravely.

108
00:07:25,542 --> 00:07:28,625
"THE RULER OF ARROGANCE"
I'm the Ruler of Arrogance.

109
00:07:28,625 --> 00:07:30,167
Thank you.

110
00:07:30,917 --> 00:07:32,583
Spotlight?

111
00:07:36,542 --> 00:07:37,708
Seriously?

112
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:41,875
Could you have used Fantasy spell as well
so I see the illusion of my victory?

113
00:07:41,875 --> 00:07:43,792
How is that possible?

114
00:07:43,792 --> 00:07:44,917
That's right.

115
00:07:44,917 --> 00:07:47,250
Oh my, I'm so angry!

116
00:07:47,875 --> 00:07:52,875
Oh no, my HP value is down to one.

117
00:07:52,875 --> 00:07:55,792
Although I can hang on with Patience,

118
00:07:55,792 --> 00:07:59,458
I will surely be dead
if attacked by a fire dragon.

119
00:08:00,833 --> 00:08:03,917
Very well.
It doesn't have the strength to climb up.

120
00:08:03,917 --> 00:08:05,708
Now is a good opportunity.

121
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:13,000
I want to defeat you.
Say goodbye to the sneaky spider life.

122
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,833
It's finally my turn
to use these two final skills.

123
00:08:17,917 --> 00:08:20,208
We're counting on you,
the person in charge of magic No. 1.

124
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:22,083
Okay, leave it to me.

125
00:08:22,083 --> 00:08:23,167
No. 2.

126
00:08:23,917 --> 00:08:26,000
No. 2!

127
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:28,833
Is it my turn now?

128
00:08:28,833 --> 00:08:30,083
What are you talking about?

129
00:08:30,083 --> 00:08:33,792
This magic must be done by two people.

130
00:08:33,792 --> 00:08:35,792
Because you weren't treating me seriously,

131
00:08:35,792 --> 00:08:38,375
-and you are very fierce...
-Charge!

132
00:08:39,667 --> 00:08:41,332
I'm in charge of the preparation.

133
00:08:41,332 --> 00:08:43,624
I... I'm in charge of backup.

134
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:49,500
The magic that has been laid out
since the beginning of this battle is completed.

135
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:53,375
Charge! Level one Abyss Magic, go!

136
00:08:53,375 --> 00:08:59,583
The highest level of dark magic that
swallows all the lights with its dark power.

137
00:08:59,583 --> 00:09:03,417
Show up, Gate of Hell!

138
00:09:36,542 --> 00:09:42,125
The frightening Gate of Hell.
Even the fire dragon is...

139
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:49,458
Seriously? It can even take that?

140
00:09:56,375 --> 00:10:00,667
The victory shall be announced
after the next blow.

141
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:05,917
Hand-to-hand combat is the right answer.

142
00:10:05,917 --> 00:10:09,000
When the MP value and SP value are so low,

143
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,208
the only way can be taken
is the most primitive one,

144
00:10:11,208 --> 00:10:15,917
the most effective strike that can display
your physical strength and ability value.

145
00:10:15,917 --> 00:10:18,958
Sadly, your opponent is me.

146
00:10:29,667 --> 00:10:32,375
Caught!

147
00:10:41,917 --> 00:10:44,875
What a wonderful battle.

148
00:10:44,875 --> 00:10:47,417
Experience achieved a certain level.

149
00:10:47,417 --> 00:10:52,042
The Sickle of Death
upgraded from level 15 to 16.

150
00:10:52,042 --> 00:10:56,500
The Sickle of Death
upgraded from level 16 to 17.

151
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:59,292
The Sickle of Death
upgraded from level 17 to 18.

152
00:10:59,292 --> 00:11:00,875
Here it comes...

153
00:11:00,875 --> 00:11:04,083
The Sickle of Death
upgraded from level 18 to 19.

154
00:11:04,083 --> 00:11:05,750
Hooray!

155
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:07,542
"THE TITLE 'DRAGON SLAYER' OBTAINED."
Condition fulfilled.

156
00:11:07,542 --> 00:11:11,708
-Sadly, just one more level to the highest.
The title "Dragon Slayer" is obtained.

157
00:11:14,792 --> 00:11:16,125
Oh no!

158
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:18,167
What's wrong,
the person in charge of information?

159
00:11:18,167 --> 00:11:22,875
Abyss Magic seems to have caused
the ground to sink. Lava is flowing out.

160
00:11:22,875 --> 00:11:24,667
Seriously?

161
00:11:24,667 --> 00:11:25,833
It's real.

162
00:11:25,833 --> 00:11:28,792
Let's take the fire dragon and retreat.

163
00:11:28,792 --> 00:11:30,667
We have to take along such a big thing?

164
00:11:30,667 --> 00:11:32,458
Of course!

165
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:35,000
Hit it, eat it, be full.

166
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,458
That's the must-process.

167
00:11:40,583 --> 00:11:43,167
A dragon is killed.

168
00:11:43,167 --> 00:11:46,125
The location is Great Elroe Labyrinth.

169
00:11:46,125 --> 00:11:48,292
Is it that fellow's doing?

170
00:11:48,292 --> 00:11:50,583
No, it can't be.

171
00:11:50,583 --> 00:11:53,750
That fellow can't move on its own.

172
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:55,917
If that's the case, who else would it be?

173
00:11:55,917 --> 00:11:58,583
Activate administrative permission...

174
00:11:58,583 --> 00:12:02,208
What kind of skill is that?

175
00:12:02,208 --> 00:12:05,125
I can only find out after the meeting.

176
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:08,750
"GRAVITATIONAL EVIL EYE OBTAINED"
Gravitational Evil Eye obtained.

177
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:10,375
"GRAVITATIONAL EVIL EYE"
Great!

178
00:12:10,375 --> 00:12:13,667
"INCREASE THE GRAVITY OF OPPONENTS IN SIGHT"
This skill slows down opponents' movements.

179
00:12:13,667 --> 00:12:16,375
Then use Cursed Evil Eye to weaken opponents.

180
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:20,667
Lastly, use Numbing Evil Eye
to completely block opponents' actions.

181
00:12:20,667 --> 00:12:24,125
Triple-kill Evil Eye is completed.

182
00:12:24,125 --> 00:12:27,000
Do you think I look more like Devil now?

183
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,542
Not bad...

184
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:35,792
But the scales of fire dragons are hard.

185
00:12:35,792 --> 00:12:38,500
When will I be able to eat this?

186
00:12:39,417 --> 00:12:41,958
Spatial perception is reacting.

187
00:12:41,958 --> 00:12:44,417
Distortion of space.

188
00:12:44,417 --> 00:12:48,417
Although this is
my first time experiencing this,

189
00:12:48,417 --> 00:12:49,750
I know this is a shift.

190
00:12:50,833 --> 00:12:55,667
Someone is teleporting in this direction.

191
00:12:56,667 --> 00:13:00,542
Someone who is very good in using spatial magic.

192
00:13:00,542 --> 00:13:05,917
He uses magic,
that means he has the wisdom of magic.

193
00:13:05,917 --> 00:13:10,542
Besides, he's able to use
some very complicated magic.

194
00:13:10,542 --> 00:13:12,750
I'm here alone.

195
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:16,500
That means I must be the target.

196
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:20,042
Although I can use Speed Thinking
to slow time down,

197
00:13:20,042 --> 00:13:23,833
my body movement can't be faster than his.

198
00:13:23,833 --> 00:13:26,708
That also means... I have nowhere to run.

199
00:13:41,792 --> 00:13:44,750
SO I'M A SPIDER, SO WHAT?

200
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:47,250
"UNABLE TO IDENTIFY"
I can't defeat this person.

201
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:49,042
Our levels are way too different.

202
00:13:49,042 --> 00:13:52,917
However, I don't feel threatened.

203
00:13:52,917 --> 00:13:55,250
Who are you?

204
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:57,292
What?

205
00:13:57,292 --> 00:14:00,458
Why aren't you answering?
Are you the subordinate of D?

206
00:14:00,458 --> 00:14:03,292
No. Please speak Japanese.

207
00:14:03,292 --> 00:14:06,833
Spider, I'm asking you.

208
00:14:06,833 --> 00:14:10,292
I can't speak Isekaigo.

209
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:17,208
I don't understand you, okay?

210
00:14:17,208 --> 00:14:21,083
I'm a Japanese... No, I'm a Japanese spider.

211
00:14:23,625 --> 00:14:25,708
How can this be?

212
00:14:25,708 --> 00:14:29,167
"LANGUAGE BARRIER"
I must learn Isekaigo.

213
00:14:32,167 --> 00:14:33,500
Smartphone?

214
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,417
Why is there a smartphone here?

215
00:14:35,417 --> 00:14:38,500
To be exact,
why is there a smartphone in this world?

216
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:43,125
Besides, it appeared suddenly
without being detected.

217
00:14:43,125 --> 00:14:47,958
-Hello, I'm admin D.
-(Isekaigo) Hello, I'm admin D.

218
00:14:47,958 --> 00:14:50,208
What?

219
00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:55,917
It's D indeed. What do you want?

220
00:14:55,917 --> 00:14:58,167
What is that? An app for instant translation?

221
00:14:58,167 --> 00:15:01,625
Great! App of Isekai is powerful indeed.

222
00:15:01,625 --> 00:15:04,042
Miss Spider, hold on a second.

223
00:15:04,042 --> 00:15:05,625
Okay.

224
00:15:05,958 --> 00:15:08,750
Long time no see, Mr. Black.

225
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:10,667
What is your plan?

226
00:15:10,667 --> 00:15:17,375
This spider is a victim
of the ex-Warrior's and Devil's prank.

227
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:18,792
Aren't you the one who sent her here?

228
00:15:18,792 --> 00:15:22,125
It's all her fault.
One of my clan members was killed.

229
00:15:22,125 --> 00:15:25,667
Don't do anything to her.

230
00:15:33,458 --> 00:15:34,875
What's going on?

231
00:15:34,875 --> 00:15:37,000
Sorry for the wait, Miss Spider.

232
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,333
Yes. Hello.

233
00:15:38,333 --> 00:15:43,500
I've given him order.
He will never disturb you again.

234
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,875
I see.

235
00:15:45,875 --> 00:15:48,000
But who is she?

236
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,375
I'm D.

237
00:15:49,375 --> 00:15:51,708
You read my mind?

238
00:15:51,708 --> 00:15:52,417
That's right.

239
00:15:52,417 --> 00:15:54,833
That's human rights violation.

240
00:15:54,833 --> 00:15:57,917
I don't normally read your mind.

241
00:15:57,917 --> 00:15:58,917
Normally...

242
00:15:58,917 --> 00:16:02,542
Does it mean you have been monitoring my move?

243
00:16:02,542 --> 00:16:05,750
I don't like the word "monitoring".

244
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:08,583
I think "watching the battle"
describes it better.

245
00:16:08,583 --> 00:16:11,333
Because I can't get tired of looking at you.

246
00:16:11,333 --> 00:16:12,750
Hold on, D is...

247
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:14,333
YOUR REQUEST HAS BEEN ACCEPTED BY ADMIN D.
WISDOM IS BEING CREATED.

248
00:16:14,333 --> 00:16:15,875
It was then...

249
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:18,708
Yes, that was your reward.

250
00:16:18,708 --> 00:16:21,250
What is your actual aim?

251
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:26,208
I'm just having fun. There's no meaningful aim.

252
00:16:26,208 --> 00:16:29,917
After all, I'm the world most evil Evil God.

253
00:16:29,917 --> 00:16:31,542
Evil God?

254
00:16:31,542 --> 00:16:32,875
That's true.

255
00:16:32,875 --> 00:16:37,917
Because I'm Evil God,
I like to watch people suffer.

256
00:16:37,917 --> 00:16:41,250
So this world is created for your pleasure?

257
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:43,250
That's not true.

258
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:46,042
To the world, I'm just an outsider.

259
00:16:46,042 --> 00:16:47,708
What does it mean?

260
00:16:47,708 --> 00:16:50,333
I can't disclose more information to you.

261
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:53,000
It won't be fun if I tell you.

262
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,708
What do you mean by won't be fun?
What kind of excuse is that?

263
00:16:55,708 --> 00:16:59,708
Please keep suffering
from now on for my amusement.

264
00:16:59,708 --> 00:17:03,542
Perhaps you can find your answer in the future.

265
00:17:03,542 --> 00:17:05,333
What nonsense are you talking about?

266
00:17:05,333 --> 00:17:06,917
Goodbye.

267
00:17:30,792 --> 00:17:34,000
Let's start the meeting, Balto.

268
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,333
Okay.

269
00:17:37,458 --> 00:17:42,000
Please report the progress
in all aspects, First Legion.

270
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:49,125
First Legion is ready to depart
to the Kusorion Fortress of Renxandt Empire.

271
00:17:49,125 --> 00:17:52,750
We can depart anytime
as soon as we receive an order.

272
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:54,000
Report completed.

273
00:17:55,792 --> 00:17:58,250
Same goes to Second Legion.

274
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:04,042
But if more time is given to me,
I may complete the work behind the scenes.

275
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:07,042
How long do you need?

276
00:18:07,042 --> 00:18:10,417
If we hurry up,
it can be done in two to three days.

277
00:18:10,417 --> 00:18:13,208
As long as it doesn't affect the attack,
go ahead.

278
00:18:13,208 --> 00:18:15,583
Thank you.

279
00:18:15,583 --> 00:18:18,458
Next, Third Legion.

280
00:18:18,458 --> 00:18:22,333
Do we have to go to war? Is it unavoidable?

281
00:18:22,333 --> 00:18:25,250
If it was avoidable, we would have avoided it.

282
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:27,417
Is there no other way?

283
00:18:27,417 --> 00:18:30,458
Well, it could be avoided.

284
00:18:30,458 --> 00:18:32,958
Really? What should we do?

285
00:18:32,958 --> 00:18:34,250
Simple.

286
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:38,833
Just have all of you from Third Legion
become the cornerstone of the world.

287
00:18:40,875 --> 00:18:43,875
That can avoid wars.

288
00:18:43,875 --> 00:18:46,000
Sorry.

289
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,458
Please forgive me for being unreasonable.

290
00:18:48,458 --> 00:18:51,292
Never say unnecessary things again.

291
00:18:51,292 --> 00:18:52,333
What about the report?

292
00:18:52,333 --> 00:18:54,667
Everything is going well.

293
00:18:57,167 --> 00:19:00,125
Next, Seventh Legion.

294
00:19:00,125 --> 00:19:04,000
Brother, I still can't accept it.

295
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:09,958
Why aren't you, instead of the little girl,
the Devil? You ruled the Demon Clan.

296
00:19:09,958 --> 00:19:11,250
That's odd.

297
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:12,167
Bloe.

298
00:19:12,167 --> 00:19:13,708
I'm at fault too.

299
00:19:13,708 --> 00:19:16,167
Why do we have to listen to that girl's orders?

300
00:19:16,167 --> 00:19:19,792
She doesn't deserve your loyalty.

301
00:19:19,792 --> 00:19:20,792
She...

302
00:19:20,792 --> 00:19:21,750
Darad.

303
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:24,958
There should be a limit
to being rude to the Devil.

304
00:19:24,958 --> 00:19:26,333
No matter who Devil is,

305
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:29,792
the Demon Clan should be loyal to her.
That's the truth of this world.

306
00:19:29,792 --> 00:19:31,250
Did you forget that?

307
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:32,917
Who cares about that?

308
00:19:32,917 --> 00:19:37,083
Devil thinks more thoroughly
than you and I can imagine.

309
00:19:37,083 --> 00:19:41,333
I will not listen to her
just because she's Devil.

310
00:19:41,333 --> 00:19:42,208
What?

311
00:19:42,208 --> 00:19:46,833
Don't you point your fingers at me, imbecile.

312
00:19:46,833 --> 00:19:51,625
How dare you call me an imbecile?

313
00:19:51,625 --> 00:19:52,833
Just to my liking.

314
00:19:52,833 --> 00:19:54,042
You rotter.

315
00:19:57,375 --> 00:19:58,500
My body...

316
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,375
Is not listening to me.

317
00:20:01,542 --> 00:20:03,542
Excuse me.

318
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:07,917
Can you not quarrel because of trivial matters?

319
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:14,333
Devil isn't called Devil
because she's the Devil.

320
00:20:17,917 --> 00:20:22,375
Devil is called Devil because
she has the qualification to be the Devil.

321
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:31,667
If you keep making trouble
I will use Abyss Magic on you.

322
00:20:33,042 --> 00:20:35,375
I'm truly sorry.

323
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,958
Now it's Eighth Legion's turn.

324
00:20:43,958 --> 00:20:46,208
There's no problem.

325
00:20:47,667 --> 00:20:51,792
Ninth Legion is ready to attack too.

326
00:20:54,375 --> 00:20:57,250
Tenth Legion has no problem.

327
00:20:59,292 --> 00:21:02,542
Everything is going smoothly.

328
00:21:03,208 --> 00:21:04,208
So...

329
00:21:04,917 --> 00:21:07,333
let's battle!

330
00:21:28,833 --> 00:21:33,083
It's been a long while since we first met.

331
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:34,333
Yes.

332
00:21:34,333 --> 00:21:39,667
I didn't expect we would
be in such a relationship then.

333
00:21:39,667 --> 00:21:41,208
You're right.

334
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:45,667
We can't sit here and be destroyed.

335
00:21:47,875 --> 00:21:50,250
We shall have the Warriors die then,

336
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:55,250
although I feel sorry for Yamada.

337
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:58,833
Julius, Demon Clan's direction is a little odd.

338
00:21:58,833 --> 00:22:01,333
Is there something wrong?

339
00:22:01,333 --> 00:22:04,292
It would be better to gather the combat power,

340
00:22:04,292 --> 00:22:07,042
yet they dispersed it.

341
00:22:07,042 --> 00:22:09,000
We better watch out.

342
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,625
Don't be reckless.

343
00:22:10,625 --> 00:22:12,167
Okay.

344
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:20,792
There are many mysteries regarding the relations
between earth dragons and fire dragons,

345
00:22:20,792 --> 00:22:22,792
But their evolution...

346
00:22:22,792 --> 00:22:24,292
CONDITIONS FULFILLED.
THE TITLE "WARRIOR" OBTAINED.

347
00:22:25,042 --> 00:22:25,625
COMPLIMENTARY EFFECTS OF THE TITLE "WARRIOR"

348
00:22:25,625 --> 00:22:26,417
LEVEL ONE SKILL OF WARRIOR
AND HOLY BEAM MAGIC OBTAINED

349
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:32,875
Schlain, what's going on?

350
00:22:32,875 --> 00:22:34,917
-Conditions fulfilled.
Is there a problem?

351
00:22:34,917 --> 00:22:37,792
-The title "Warrior" obtained.
-Brother.

352
00:22:37,792 --> 00:22:40,375
-Complimentary effects of the title "Warrior".
-Shun.

353
00:22:40,375 --> 00:22:41,917
-Level one skills of warrior and
-What's wrong with you?

354
00:22:41,917 --> 00:22:45,583
-You're pale.
-Holy Beam Magic obtained.

355
00:22:45,583 --> 00:22:47,458
Isn't this odd?

356
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,375
There's only one person in this world
who has the Warrior title.

357
00:22:53,125 --> 00:22:56,417
I only know a Warrior.

358
00:22:56,417 --> 00:23:03,250
When one obtains this title,
he will not lose it, as long as he's alive...

359
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:06,458
Impossible...

360
00:23:06,458 --> 00:23:07,208
Shun.

361
00:23:07,208 --> 00:23:08,500
What's wrong with you?

362
00:23:09,708 --> 00:23:18,750
Impossible...

363
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:20,125
Brother!

364
00:23:36,333 --> 00:23:39,000
SO I'M A SPIDER, SO WHAT?
NEXT EPISODE: WHO IS THIS OLD MAN?

365
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,458
STAY TUNED
