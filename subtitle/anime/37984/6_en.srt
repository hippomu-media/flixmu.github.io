1
00:00:01,708 --> 00:00:03,667
Isn't he great?

2
00:00:03,667 --> 00:00:05,750
He isn't just a warrior,

3
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:08,208
he's also excellent in dealing with people.

4
00:00:08,208 --> 00:00:09,875
Brother Julius.

5
00:00:09,875 --> 00:00:13,583
I've heard these words before.

6
00:00:13,583 --> 00:00:16,125
What? Really?

7
00:00:16,125 --> 00:00:20,792
I already knew how good your brother is.

8
00:00:24,208 --> 00:00:27,583
Brother, what are you doing now?

9
00:00:32,875 --> 00:00:33,750
Yana.

10
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:34,833
Yes.

11
00:00:51,875 --> 00:00:53,583
That was awesome.

12
00:00:54,833 --> 00:00:57,958
Although there are
dangerous monsters around here,

13
00:00:57,958 --> 00:01:01,208
a warrior can handle them without any problem.

14
00:01:03,042 --> 00:01:05,792
Let's head to the entrance of Middle Stratum,

15
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:08,625
where our target situated.

16
00:01:15,333 --> 00:01:19,500
Our target is a taratect.

17
00:01:20,083 --> 00:01:24,125

41

SO I'M A SPIDER, SO WHAT?

42
00:02:50,708 --> 00:02:52,083
Oh my.

43
00:02:52,083 --> 00:02:55,917
I didn't expect catfish to be so delicious.

44
00:02:55,917 --> 00:02:59,667
I'm willing to risk my life for that taste.

45
00:03:01,208 --> 00:03:05,417
But I can't find a catfish.

46
00:03:05,417 --> 00:03:08,917
Maybe I can use
the investigation skill to solve this.

47
00:03:08,917 --> 00:03:09,958
Let's forget it.

48
00:03:09,958 --> 00:03:11,292
Forget it...

49
00:03:11,292 --> 00:03:13,375
I can't stand the headache.

50
00:03:14,792 --> 00:03:18,667
The other skills I obtained
are foreseeing and enduring.

51
00:03:18,667 --> 00:03:22,667
These two have nothing to do with investigation.

52
00:03:22,667 --> 00:03:23,833
Despite so,

53
00:03:23,833 --> 00:03:28,208
"INVESTIGATION"
my enemy-detecting skill is quite good.

54
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:29,917
Be it in Upper Stratum or Lower Stratum,

55
00:03:29,917 --> 00:03:32,708
I haven't been sneak-raided.

56
00:03:32,708 --> 00:03:37,000
Is that because I can detect
the surrounding changes?

57
00:03:37,833 --> 00:03:41,208
The wind... isn't peaceful.

58
00:03:41,208 --> 00:03:46,167
If that's the case, I may not be able to detect
sneak attacks from underground or underwater.

59
00:03:46,167 --> 00:03:52,417
So I must look out for the monsters
that appear suddenly from the lava.

60
00:03:52,417 --> 00:03:54,625
Something appeared indeed.

61
00:03:57,917 --> 00:03:59,917
ELROE GUNERAVE. LEVEL TWO.

62
00:04:02,167 --> 00:04:03,458
An eel?

63
00:04:05,833 --> 00:04:08,750
This eel looks strong.

64
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:11,625
And it targeted me.

65
00:04:11,625 --> 00:04:13,542
I can only defeat it with speed.

66
00:04:13,542 --> 00:04:17,708
Other skills have no use against it.

67
00:04:17,708 --> 00:04:20,791
Even if I escape, I may be caught up
because of the difference in physical fitness.

68
00:04:20,791 --> 00:04:22,583
What's going on?

69
00:04:22,583 --> 00:04:25,125
Its movements look fuzzy.

70
00:04:25,125 --> 00:04:28,000
Could this be the foreseeing ability?

71
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:30,417
I see.

72
00:04:30,417 --> 00:04:33,125
I can see the near future.

73
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:37,375
Hold on. The attacks are too condensed.

74
00:04:38,125 --> 00:04:40,292
Its attack formation
is similar to those of the seahorse,

75
00:04:40,292 --> 00:04:42,167
but way faster.

76
00:04:42,167 --> 00:04:44,792
It's difficult to dodge with foresight.

77
00:04:44,792 --> 00:04:47,333
I can't fight even if I dodge.

78
00:04:47,333 --> 00:04:50,625
It's despicable of it
to attack from a safe zone.

79
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,375
Oh no!

80
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:55,083
I have a bad hunch.

81
00:04:55,083 --> 00:04:58,083
It's hot...

82
00:04:58,083 --> 00:05:00,458
It can even attack from a distance.

83
00:05:00,458 --> 00:05:04,250
But that must have costed it
a lot of MP value.

84
00:05:05,708 --> 00:05:07,500
There's still half left.

85
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,292
But when the MP value is used up,

86
00:05:09,292 --> 00:05:12,458
it can no longer attack from a distance.

87
00:05:13,167 --> 00:05:15,792
I must dodge until then.

88
00:05:16,542 --> 00:05:17,917
It's so fast.

89
00:05:17,917 --> 00:05:18,333
"PROFICIENCY ACHIEVED A CERTAIN LEVEL."
Reward for upgraded skill proficiency.

90
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:18,833
"ACCELERATED THINKING UPGRADED TO LEVEL TWO."
Reward for upgraded skill proficiency.

91
00:05:18,833 --> 00:05:19,417
"FORESEEING SKILL UPGRADED TO LEVEL TWO"
Reward for upgraded skill proficiency.

92
00:05:19,417 --> 00:05:20,875
"DODGING SKILL UPGRADED TO LEVEL SIX."
Reward for upgraded skill proficiency.

93
00:05:20,875 --> 00:05:23,125
I'm thankful for the skills upgrade.

94
00:05:23,125 --> 00:05:26,375
The eel's movement is becoming clearer.

95
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:29,833
Is that a lateral attack?

96
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,750
Thank the upgraded foreseeing skill,
I can dodge easily.

97
00:05:37,667 --> 00:05:40,708
Aiming while spitting fire is against the rules.

98
00:05:43,833 --> 00:05:45,667
Gift-skill.

99
00:05:50,667 --> 00:05:53,250
Ah...

100
00:05:58,083 --> 00:05:59,458
Let me explain.

101
00:05:59,458 --> 00:06:00,917
Gift-skill

102
00:06:00,917 --> 00:06:04,458
consumes SP value
to strengthen the spider silks.

103
00:06:04,458 --> 00:06:05,667
Although the effect is short,

104
00:06:05,667 --> 00:06:08,042
it stops the silks from being burnt.

105
00:06:11,542 --> 00:06:13,083
Because it consumes a lot of energy,

106
00:06:13,083 --> 00:06:15,375
I can't use it randomly.

107
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:18,250
But the eel's energy is being consumed quickly.

108
00:06:22,042 --> 00:06:23,792
It's hot...

109
00:06:24,958 --> 00:06:26,125
It's painful.

110
00:06:26,125 --> 00:06:28,917
But there's only a little left.

111
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:38,375
I managed to dodge.

112
00:06:38,375 --> 00:06:40,125
That means, it...

113
00:06:44,833 --> 00:06:46,417
Very good.

114
00:06:47,458 --> 00:06:49,000
It's coming onto the land.

115
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,250
I can finally have a showdown with it.

116
00:06:52,542 --> 00:06:53,500
It's so quick.

117
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:56,458
Our ability values are too different.

118
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:59,375
But I can make up with my skills.

119
00:07:01,292 --> 00:07:04,583
I'm waiting for you to use this skill.

120
00:07:04,583 --> 00:07:07,875
Synthesised venom!

121
00:07:17,792 --> 00:07:20,292
My body aches.

122
00:07:20,292 --> 00:07:23,708
But I defeated this strong enemy.

123
00:07:23,708 --> 00:07:25,958
My level should be upgraded, right?

124
00:07:26,917 --> 00:07:30,208
Odd. Why isn't the level upgraded?

125
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:32,625
Haven't I defeated it?

126
00:07:32,625 --> 00:07:35,250
LIFE EXCHANGE

127
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:37,833
VENOM RESISTANCE. LEVEL ONE.
AUTOMATIC HP LEVEL RECOVERY. LEVEL ONE.

128
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:41,708
He even obtained new skills
because of the attack just now.

129
00:07:41,708 --> 00:07:43,750
I must deal with it before it can move again...

130
00:07:47,542 --> 00:07:49,833
and before the spider silks are burnt.

131
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,667
Take this!

132
00:07:52,667 --> 00:07:55,333
Venom machine gun!

133
00:08:02,042 --> 00:08:05,250
Please. If this doesn't work,

134
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:06,417
I will have no other ways anymore.

135
00:08:15,417 --> 00:08:17,958
Experience achieved a certain target.

136
00:08:17,958 --> 00:08:21,542
Upgraded from level seven to ten.

137
00:08:24,833 --> 00:08:26,750
Breaking shell.

138
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:29,708
I'm reborn.

139
00:08:29,708 --> 00:08:33,042
Various basic skills are upgraded.

140
00:08:33,042 --> 00:08:34,625
"SP VALUE RECOVERY SPEED UPGRADED TO LEVEL THREE."
Reward for upgraded skill proficiency.

141
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:35,625
"EXPLOSION SKILL UPGRADED TO LEVEL NINE."
Reward for upgraded skill proficiency.

142
00:08:35,625 --> 00:08:37,125
"ENDURANCE UPGRADED TO LEVEL NINE."
Reward for upgraded skill proficiency.

143
00:08:37,125 --> 00:08:39,207
"CALCULATION PROCESSING UPGRADED TO LEVEL SEVEN."
It's upgraded for three levels at one go?

144
00:08:39,207 --> 00:08:41,249
"SIGHT IMPROVED TO LEVEL NINE."
Such shocking numbers.

145
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:43,125
Conditions fulfilled.

146
00:08:43,125 --> 00:08:47,000
THE SICKLE OF DEATH. SPIDER MONSTER.
Small taratect may evolve.

147
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,958
There are two options for evolution.

148
00:08:49,958 --> 00:08:50,917
Evolution?

149
00:08:50,917 --> 00:08:53,167
Let's talk about evolution later.

150
00:08:53,167 --> 00:08:55,208
The more urgent matter now is...

151
00:08:57,083 --> 00:08:59,000
I won!

152
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:05,292
I defeated such a strong eel.

153
00:09:05,292 --> 00:09:07,958
Isn't it great?
Don't you think that I'm powerful?

154
00:09:07,958 --> 00:09:11,042
I won't let others say I'm weak.

155
00:09:11,042 --> 00:09:12,792
I'm very strong!

156
00:09:12,792 --> 00:09:14,833
I'm number one.

157
00:09:17,083 --> 00:09:19,167
I'm too happy.

158
00:09:19,167 --> 00:09:21,542
Okay, I should think about my future plan.

159
00:09:21,542 --> 00:09:23,542
I shall sit first.

160
00:09:23,542 --> 00:09:25,500
Should I evolve first?

161
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:28,292
No. I'm completely defenseless
during an evolution.

162
00:09:28,292 --> 00:09:32,625
If I have no "home",
I will be finished when attacked.

163
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:35,750
But I would love to evolve.

164
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:39,750
There are two options for evolution.
Let's have a look.

165
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:42,917
If I were to evolve,
I would choose The Sick of Death.

166
00:09:42,917 --> 00:09:44,708
Because the strict evolution condition

167
00:09:44,708 --> 00:09:46,875
and the high combat ability are very attractive.

168
00:09:46,875 --> 00:09:48,958
Small-body size is a plus point too.

169
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:53,125
The symbol of inauspiciousness
can satisfy my delusion.

170
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:55,417
One can handle the advantages
as well as the disadvantages.

171
00:09:55,417 --> 00:09:59,125
But the mainstream technology
is about reducing sizes.

172
00:09:59,125 --> 00:10:00,833
Besides, if I became bigger here,

173
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:01,667
I wouldn't fall into a lake,

174
00:10:01,667 --> 00:10:03,000
but into a lava pool.

175
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:03,750
I would die.

176
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:06,292
My target is to be a high-tech small creature.

177
00:10:06,292 --> 00:10:08,792
Okay. I want to become The Sickle of Death.

178
00:10:08,792 --> 00:10:10,250
The problem is the process of evolution.

179
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:12,458
But I have figured out a solution.

180
00:10:12,458 --> 00:10:16,542
I shall make use of the dead body of this eel.

181
00:10:16,542 --> 00:10:18,500
Let's start now.

182
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:22,208
"ELROE'S 3-MINUTE DECORATION"
Today's 3-minute decoration.

183
00:10:22,208 --> 00:10:26,417
Have a look at these awesome,
fresh and hard scales.

184
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:30,042
External attacks are nothing to it.

185
00:10:30,042 --> 00:10:33,250
I will use it to build a shelter.

186
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:35,667
First, raise its tail

187
00:10:35,667 --> 00:10:40,042
and form a circular fort with it.

188
00:10:40,042 --> 00:10:43,333
Make sure there's space
in the middle for evolution.

189
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:46,167
Form a curled form.

190
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:50,917
Lastly, cover the top. Then it's done.

191
00:10:50,917 --> 00:10:54,083
What? You said it was less than 3 minutes?

192
00:10:54,083 --> 00:10:57,875
Don't mind the trivial matters.

193
00:10:59,208 --> 00:11:04,667
This looks a little like an anal excretion.

194
00:11:04,667 --> 00:11:06,958
I don't want to go into details regarding that.

195
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:15,083
I shall evolve now.

196
00:11:22,458 --> 00:11:24,000
Good morning!

197
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,708
I don't know if the morning is good,

198
00:11:25,708 --> 00:11:28,833
but it's good to be able to evolve safely.

199
00:11:28,833 --> 00:11:31,875
Let's prepare the food now.

200
00:11:31,875 --> 00:11:35,458
Let's identify the ability values
while removing the scales.

201
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:39,917
The values have increased a lot.

202
00:11:39,917 --> 00:11:43,042
It's real that the combat ability will be high.

203
00:11:43,042 --> 00:11:46,417
Hold on. Could I really be that strong?

204
00:11:46,417 --> 00:11:49,208
My spring is finally here.

205
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:52,125
My ability values have surpassed
those of the seahorse,

206
00:11:52,125 --> 00:11:54,458
and even those of the apes.

207
00:11:56,125 --> 00:11:59,458
I'm becoming hungry after the evolution.

208
00:11:59,458 --> 00:12:01,458
Hurry up...

209
00:12:01,958 --> 00:12:05,833
This sickles make neat cuts.

210
00:12:13,917 --> 00:12:16,750
It looks delicious.

211
00:12:18,042 --> 00:12:20,417
I shall eat now.

212
00:12:27,292 --> 00:12:29,625
Unwittingly, I finished.

213
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,417
When did I finish it?

214
00:12:32,417 --> 00:12:35,708
Could it be too delicious that I forgot?

215
00:12:35,708 --> 00:12:38,125
Eels are really scary.

216
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:41,208
Forget it. I will beat another one.

217
00:12:41,208 --> 00:12:42,792
Well, now,

218
00:12:42,792 --> 00:12:46,042
let's see what skills
I can redeem with my points.

219
00:12:48,208 --> 00:12:51,000
There are too many choices. I can't decide.

220
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,542
It seems there are
not many skills like Arrogance.

221
00:12:54,542 --> 00:12:56,542
PATIENCE

222
00:12:56,542 --> 00:12:58,250
Before MP value is used up,

223
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:02,583
I could still survive with low HP value.

224
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:05,125
That's a destructive skill indeed.

225
00:13:05,125 --> 00:13:08,375
Such a skill should be obtained
without hesitations.

226
00:13:08,375 --> 00:13:10,542
Patience skill obtained.

227
00:13:10,542 --> 00:13:13,042
0 point left.

228
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:17,333
"EXCLUSION SKILL UPGRADED FROM LEVEL FIVE TO SEVEN."
Exclusion skill has upgraded by two levels.

229
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:20,375
Whatever. I can't use it either.

230
00:13:20,375 --> 00:13:22,958
Compared to that,
there's also Heretical Doctrine Invalidation.

231
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:28,042
The headache investigation skill caused
is also a heretical doctrine.

232
00:13:28,042 --> 00:13:30,750
Could I use this to stop it?

233
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:32,000
I can only find out after trying it.

234
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,625
Activate investigation skill.

235
00:13:39,875 --> 00:13:41,250
This is so great.

236
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:42,875
This is really great.

237
00:13:43,792 --> 00:13:47,833
The world actually looks like this.

238
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:51,000
I feel like crying.

239
00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:55,542
I'm feeling touched.

240
00:13:57,292 --> 00:14:00,792
My ability values increased shockingly.

241
00:14:00,792 --> 00:14:03,458
Isn't it? The investigation skill is so awesome.

242
00:14:04,375 --> 00:14:06,500
I think I heard something.

243
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:09,875
I said, I don't need false reactions.

244
00:14:09,875 --> 00:14:13,542
I heard my own voice in my head.

245
00:14:13,542 --> 00:14:15,542
Who are you?

246
00:14:16,208 --> 00:14:19,083
I'm you. You are me.

247
00:14:19,083 --> 00:14:20,333
Well...

248
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:22,583
I don't know what you're talking about.

249
00:14:22,583 --> 00:14:25,583
Thanks to your level-one juxtaposed will,

250
00:14:25,583 --> 00:14:27,208
that's how I'm born.

251
00:14:27,208 --> 00:14:28,167
I see.

252
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:30,833
You're being too indifferent. This is awesome.

253
00:14:31,625 --> 00:14:33,417
What is so awesome about this?

254
00:14:33,417 --> 00:14:38,167
You can think with different willpower.

255
00:14:38,167 --> 00:14:40,625
What does that mean?

256
00:14:40,625 --> 00:14:43,375
My brain is dumb.

257
00:14:43,375 --> 00:14:46,375
Since you are me,
you're scolding yourself as well.

258
00:14:46,375 --> 00:14:50,875
During a battle,
your field of visions becomes narrow.

259
00:14:50,875 --> 00:14:52,083
You're right.

260
00:14:52,083 --> 00:14:55,000
Hence from now on,
I'm in charge of physical activity.

261
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,875
You're in charge of collecting information.

262
00:14:56,875 --> 00:15:00,292
That way,
it'll be more favourable for my battles.

263
00:15:00,292 --> 00:15:02,333
The two of us are one.

264
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:05,958
We will bear our fate together
until death do us apart.

265
00:15:05,958 --> 00:15:07,042
Yes!

266
00:15:07,042 --> 00:15:08,917
I shall leave it to you,
the person in charge of the body.

267
00:15:08,917 --> 00:15:11,458
Leave it to me, person in charge of information.

268
00:15:13,708 --> 00:15:18,292
Have I become very powerful?

269
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:21,833
It doesn't matter
if my opponent is a devil or a warrior,

270
00:15:21,833 --> 00:15:24,083
just bring it on.

271
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:27,875
SO I'M A SPIDER, SO WHAT?

272
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,875
My words may be offensive.

273
00:15:31,875 --> 00:15:34,917
You're not just good in fencing,

274
00:15:34,917 --> 00:15:37,708
you're also good in magic.

275
00:15:37,708 --> 00:15:40,375
In order not to be surpassed
by his younger siblings,

276
00:15:40,375 --> 00:15:42,792
he works very hard.

277
00:15:42,792 --> 00:15:45,083
Keep quiet.

278
00:15:45,083 --> 00:15:47,333
You're better in magic than the Saint.

279
00:15:47,333 --> 00:15:49,125
That's too cunning,

280
00:15:49,125 --> 00:15:51,583
because I may lose the value of my existence.

281
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:54,750
That's why I told him to not use so much magic.

282
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:55,792
Julius.

283
00:15:55,792 --> 00:15:58,792
Don't listen to that silly woman.

284
00:15:58,792 --> 00:16:00,875
Who is the silly woman?

285
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:07,792
But it feels bad here.

286
00:16:07,792 --> 00:16:10,208
Yana really hates insects.

287
00:16:10,208 --> 00:16:13,792
Our target this time is a taratect.

288
00:16:13,792 --> 00:16:17,792
You're just getting in the way.
That's why I told you not to come.

289
00:16:17,792 --> 00:16:21,000
A saint must follow the warrior all the time.

290
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,250
I can't betray the doctrine
of The Religion of God's Words.

291
00:16:25,833 --> 00:16:28,125
Warrior, here I am.

292
00:16:43,458 --> 00:16:46,083
A Greater Taratect.

293
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:47,917
Two of them.

294
00:16:47,917 --> 00:16:50,167
No, there are three of them.

295
00:16:52,417 --> 00:16:55,292
I really don't want to fight them.

296
00:16:55,292 --> 00:16:57,500
Right, Julius?

297
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,042
Julius.

298
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,958
That's our target this time.

299
00:17:08,958 --> 00:17:10,583
The residue of a nightmare.

300
00:17:10,583 --> 00:17:13,000
The monster left in the labyrinth's nightmare.

301
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,375
Warrior, die!

302
00:17:20,166 --> 00:17:22,374
Yana, please cover me with your magic.

303
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:24,083
Get it.

304
00:17:25,708 --> 00:17:27,291
Let me defeat this Greater Taratect.

305
00:17:27,291 --> 00:17:29,792
Take the chance to restrain them.

306
00:17:35,292 --> 00:17:38,917
Wouldn't it slow down
while moving on the ceiling?

307
00:17:38,917 --> 00:17:40,083
Detestable!

308
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:50,792
Cover with magic...

309
00:17:50,792 --> 00:17:52,417
What should I do?

310
00:18:11,167 --> 00:18:12,333
There's one left.

311
00:18:15,917 --> 00:18:17,583
Be gone!

312
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:20,792
Here's the opportunity.

313
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:25,375
It can surely not escape at such a timing.

314
00:18:27,167 --> 00:18:30,833
Magic is cast in an instant and offset mine.

315
00:18:30,833 --> 00:18:31,708
This fellow...

316
00:18:31,708 --> 00:18:34,917
Its ability value is at least 2000.

317
00:18:34,917 --> 00:18:36,125
If that's the case...

318
00:18:36,708 --> 00:18:37,875
Everyone, get out.

319
00:18:37,875 --> 00:18:39,000
Roger.

320
00:18:39,833 --> 00:18:41,167
Light Attack.

321
00:18:49,333 --> 00:18:51,000
Is it destroyed?

322
00:18:54,917 --> 00:18:56,708
Julius.

323
00:18:56,708 --> 00:18:58,875
Let me heal your wound.

324
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,208
It's not just agile,

325
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:06,042
it has annoying vitality too, isn't it?

326
00:19:06,042 --> 00:19:07,750
Thank you.

327
00:19:09,833 --> 00:19:13,042
There's magic stronger than the Light Attack.

328
00:19:13,042 --> 00:19:17,667
But it can escape with its speed.

329
00:19:17,667 --> 00:19:19,333
What should we do?

330
00:19:20,958 --> 00:19:23,042
What happened to it?

331
00:19:23,042 --> 00:19:25,667
Why is it afraid?

332
00:19:25,667 --> 00:19:27,542
Take this!

333
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:29,917
Now!

334
00:19:30,792 --> 00:19:32,667
Holy Beam.

335
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,833
Thank you, everyone.

336
00:19:46,833 --> 00:19:49,750
Fortunately, none is badly injured.

337
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:52,750
Let's leave this place quickly.

338
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:54,917
There's a spider behind.

339
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:57,917
Where? Where is it?

340
00:19:57,917 --> 00:20:00,375
Sorry, my bad.

341
00:20:02,958 --> 00:20:04,375
Okay, everyone.

342
00:20:04,375 --> 00:20:05,708
Let's go outside.

343
00:20:05,708 --> 00:20:07,083
Okay.

344
00:20:07,083 --> 00:20:09,292
Let's go.

345
00:20:12,375 --> 00:20:13,875
What's wrong with you?

346
00:20:13,875 --> 00:20:16,792
No, nothing.

347
00:20:18,708 --> 00:20:20,792
The residue of a nightmare.

348
00:20:20,792 --> 00:20:23,208
What was it afraid of?

349
00:20:32,167 --> 00:20:34,167
What can I do for you?

350
00:20:35,833 --> 00:20:38,167
I think I escaped unintentionally.

351
00:20:38,167 --> 00:20:40,542
Please help me with the aftermath.

352
00:20:40,542 --> 00:20:41,500
Okay.

353
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:45,833
It has nothing to do with you,
please don't mind it.

354
00:20:45,833 --> 00:20:48,250
If that's the case, it's good.

355
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:49,625
Instead of caring about such things,

356
00:20:49,625 --> 00:20:52,708
you should just do your work well.

357
00:20:52,708 --> 00:20:55,917
I will follow your order, Lord Devil.

358
00:21:01,042 --> 00:21:02,292
Do you know? This is the prelude.

359
00:21:02,292 --> 00:21:04,583
The life of a spider.

360
00:21:04,583 --> 00:21:06,167
I'm going to start singing.

♫Became a spider♫

371
00:21:14,708 --> 00:21:16,083
♫So confusing♫

372
00:21:16,083 --> 00:21:18,375
♫Running here and there in chaos, little spider♫

373
00:21:18,375 --> 00:21:20,958

♫Needless to be said, the successful people♫

383
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,375
♫are reincarnated as beautiful women♫

384
00:21:51,375 --> 00:21:52,917
♫What? There's no skill that

♫Why is my beginning so miserable?♫

403
00:22:17,875 --> 00:22:19,083
♫I will not forgive you, admin D♫

404
00:22:19,083 --> 00:22:20,250
♫The big labyrinth is just as dark today♫

405
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:21,417
♫Keep living or die trying♫

406
00:22:21,417 --> 00:22:22,667
♫Although this kind of life
is quite interesting♫

407
00:22:22,667 --> 00:22:24,417
♫I still can't accept why♫

408
00:22:24,417 --> 00:22:27,292
♫I am a spider♫

409
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:34,792
Brother stood against
the gang of monsters without hesitations.

410
00:22:34,792 --> 00:22:37,625
He's indeed the brother of Mr. Schlain.

411
00:22:37,625 --> 00:22:40,417
Both of you are so excellent.

412
00:22:40,417 --> 00:22:43,542
I'm not as good as my brother.

413
00:22:43,542 --> 00:22:44,958
You're too humble.

414
00:22:44,958 --> 00:22:48,750
The education of the noble people
is very well indeed.

415
00:22:49,583 --> 00:22:52,750
Excuse me. I have to talk to him.

416
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:54,333
Could we have some time alone?

417
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,417
Mr. Schlain is very excellent indeed.

418
00:22:58,417 --> 00:22:59,667
That's right.

419
00:22:59,667 --> 00:23:02,375
Sorry.

420
00:23:02,375 --> 00:23:03,958
Let's go.

421
00:23:07,917 --> 00:23:10,333
Let's hope he wouldn't cause any trouble.

422
00:23:12,292 --> 00:23:14,833
I'm the prince of a kingdom.

423
00:23:14,833 --> 00:23:18,083
Why should I be left out?

424
00:23:18,083 --> 00:23:21,917
Doesn't this world exist because of me?

425
00:23:26,292 --> 00:23:28,750
Yamada... No.

426
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:31,625
Schlain Zagan Analeit.

427
00:23:31,625 --> 00:23:33,917
I don't need you

428
00:23:33,917 --> 00:23:36,333
in this world.

429
00:23:36,333 --> 00:23:39,000
