00:00:09,208 --> 00:00:10,708
SECOND GRADE THIRD CLASS

2
00:00:12,333 --> 00:00:13,917
Didn't I tell you before?

3
00:00:13,917 --> 00:00:16,375
When such things happen,
just pretend like you didn't see.

4
00:00:16,375 --> 00:00:18,500
Forget it. Let's go for bowling after school.

5
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:20,542
-Come along.
-I stayed up all night to play computer games.

6
00:00:20,542 --> 00:00:22,708
Really? You kept on playing after I slept?

7
00:00:22,708 --> 00:00:25,333
This dress is cute but expensive.

8
00:00:25,333 --> 00:00:26,167
Really?

9
00:00:26,167 --> 00:00:26,917
-It's so cute.
-Which one?

10
00:00:26,917 --> 00:00:29,208
-It suits you.
-It's super cute.

11
00:00:29,208 --> 00:00:31,208
-It suits you.
-Yes, it suits you a lot.

12
00:00:31,208 --> 00:00:34,375
Alright, fellow friends.
The class is going to start.

13
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:51,708
That was so scary.

14
00:00:51,708 --> 00:00:53,000
It hurts!

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I hurt my head.

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,167
I think I'm wrapped in something hard.

17
00:00:57,167 --> 00:00:59,083
What's going on?

18
00:00:59,083 --> 00:00:59,875
It's so dark.

19
00:00:59,875 --> 00:01:02,708
I remember I was in class...

20
00:01:02,708 --> 00:01:05,917
Let's leave here first.

21
00:01:06,417 --> 00:01:08,167
I'm free!

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,417
This is...

23
00:01:27,417 --> 00:01:31,500
And this leg is...

24
00:01:34,083 --> 00:01:35,458
Calm down.

25
00:01:36,458 --> 00:01:38,500
Could this be the trend

26
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:40,167
described online?

27
00:01:40,167 --> 00:01:43,042
No way. Tell me this isn't true.

28
00:01:46,583 --> 00:01:50,500
I think I've been reincarnated as a spider.

29
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,958
Impossible. I can't accept this.

30
00:01:52,958 --> 00:01:54,167
Reincarnation is fine.

31
00:01:54,167 --> 00:01:56,708
But why did I become a spider?

32
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:01,958
Crying and sulking don't help.

33
00:02:01,958 --> 00:02:05,083
I shall be a spider then.

34
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:09,125

SO I'M A SPIDER, SO WHAT?

59
00:03:36,417 --> 00:03:41,083
Spider...

60
00:03:41,083 --> 00:03:43,292
I'm a spider.

61
00:03:45,375 --> 00:03:46,750
Is that food?

62
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:49,500
To be honest, I'm hungry as well.

63
00:03:52,125 --> 00:03:53,458
Oh my goodness.

64
00:03:53,458 --> 00:03:54,750
Why are you eating your kind?

65
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:57,083
Can't you eat something else?

66
00:03:57,417 --> 00:03:59,667
Oh Jesus!

67
00:03:59,667 --> 00:04:02,083
How can I stay in such a dangerous place?

68
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:04,375
I want to go home.

69
00:04:11,625 --> 00:04:13,417
Is that father?

70
00:04:18,208 --> 00:04:21,458
Turns out it's mother. I'm so sorry!

71
00:04:23,792 --> 00:04:26,250
Mother, why are you behaving like that too?

72
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:29,042
You're eating your own kind
as if they were snacks.

73
00:04:29,042 --> 00:04:30,458
Let's figure a way out later.

74
00:04:30,458 --> 00:04:31,542
Now,

75
00:04:31,542 --> 00:04:33,625
I should just retreat!

76
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:40,833
I almost die.

77
00:04:40,833 --> 00:04:45,167
I haven't taken a full sprint
like this in awhile.

78
00:04:45,167 --> 00:04:48,333
Anything can be done if you aim for it.

79
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:51,917
Anyway, how did I die?

80
00:04:51,917 --> 00:04:52,542
TSUREZUREGUSA PAGE 30

81
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:55,167
My last memory was ancient literature class.

82
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:57,000
The most rational guess

83
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,625
would be that I reincarnated as a spider.

84
00:04:59,625 --> 00:05:01,208
Is my death caused by a terrorist attack

85
00:05:01,208 --> 00:05:02,667
or a natural disaster?

86
00:05:03,667 --> 00:05:05,000
This is a mystery.

87
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,583
Or perhaps I am actually not dead.

88
00:05:07,583 --> 00:05:10,417
It's just that my soul is
trapped in a spider now.

89
00:05:10,417 --> 00:05:13,458
My body is lying on a bed in a hospital now.

90
00:05:13,458 --> 00:05:15,167
As for other possibilities,

91
00:05:15,167 --> 00:05:19,333
perhaps I have always been
a spider with memories.

92
00:05:22,042 --> 00:05:23,917
I don't get it. I'll stop thinking now.

93
00:05:23,917 --> 00:05:27,292
I think, therefore I am. That's enough.

94
00:05:27,292 --> 00:05:30,333
I don't know anything
about my current situation.

95
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:33,750
The amount of information affects my life.

96
00:05:34,875 --> 00:05:36,125
In light novels, there would normally

97
00:05:36,125 --> 00:05:37,333
identification skills or so on
in such situations.

98
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:39,292
It can be used to collect information.

99
00:05:39,292 --> 00:05:42,042
Your skill level is 100.

100
00:05:42,042 --> 00:05:44,125
You can use 100 points

101
00:05:44,125 --> 00:05:47,375
to exchange level one identification level.

102
00:05:47,375 --> 00:05:48,917
Do you want to redeem it?

103
00:05:48,917 --> 00:05:51,667
What? Skill? Point?

104
00:05:51,667 --> 00:05:55,792
It's as if I've been reborn into Isekai.

105
00:05:55,792 --> 00:05:58,458
If I can redeem it, I will of course do it.

106
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:01,333
Level one identification skill achieved.

107
00:06:01,333 --> 00:06:03,375
The remaining point is zero.

108
00:06:03,375 --> 00:06:04,333
Regarding identification skill,

109
00:06:04,333 --> 00:06:06,125
it's a very useful and convenient skill to have

110
00:06:06,125 --> 00:06:09,625
in the Isekai light novels genre.

111
00:06:09,625 --> 00:06:13,583
I have to get it despite using up my points.

112
00:06:13,583 --> 00:06:15,458
First of all,

113
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:17,792
this is an ordinary stone.

114
00:06:17,792 --> 00:06:19,417
After using identification skill,

115
00:06:19,417 --> 00:06:20,958
it will be different.

116
00:06:20,958 --> 00:06:22,375
"STONE"
Stone.

117
00:06:23,292 --> 00:06:26,958
Oh well, you're just kidding, right?

118
00:06:26,958 --> 00:06:28,625
Have a better look.

119
00:06:28,625 --> 00:06:29,958
Okay, once again.

120
00:06:29,958 --> 00:06:30,917
Identify!

121
00:06:30,917 --> 00:06:32,500
"STONE"
Stone.

122
00:06:33,083 --> 00:06:35,292
A stone is of course a stone.

123
00:06:35,292 --> 00:06:37,417
So you should know

124
00:06:37,417 --> 00:06:39,917
where this wall actually is, right?

125
00:06:39,917 --> 00:06:41,250
You know that, right?

126
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:41,875
Identify.

127
00:06:41,875 --> 00:06:43,375
"WALL"
Wall.

128
00:06:43,375 --> 00:06:43,917
Identify.

129
00:06:43,917 --> 00:06:44,625
"WALL"
Wall.

130
00:06:44,625 --> 00:06:48,417
Identify!

131
00:06:48,417 --> 00:06:51,625
"WALL"
Wall.

132
00:06:52,292 --> 00:06:53,458
You're totally useless!

133
00:06:53,458 --> 00:06:55,625
Why did I redeem such a skill?

134
00:06:55,625 --> 00:06:57,417
It's obviously a wall.

135
00:06:57,417 --> 00:07:00,167
You should give me more information.

136
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:02,667
No way.

137
00:07:02,667 --> 00:07:04,083
I should use reverse thinking.

138
00:07:04,083 --> 00:07:06,375
I'm only in level one.

139
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:08,417
That's how I should think.

140
00:07:08,417 --> 00:07:09,750
Let's just take a rest

141
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:12,333
while identifying myself.

142
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:15,375
"SPIDER. NAMELESS."
Spider. Nameless.

143
00:07:15,375 --> 00:07:16,958
I knew you will say that.

144
00:07:16,958 --> 00:07:19,250
But what do you mean by nameless?

145
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:22,667
Does it mean I'm a nameless spider

146
00:07:22,667 --> 00:07:25,583
or I will only find out my name after upgrading?

147
00:07:25,583 --> 00:07:29,292
I still don't know how I can upgrade.

148
00:07:29,292 --> 00:07:31,958
Terms like level, skills and points

149
00:07:31,958 --> 00:07:34,292
sound like the game world.

150
00:07:34,292 --> 00:07:36,708
Whatever. This is quite interesting too.

151
00:07:36,708 --> 00:07:38,208
Just accept it.

152
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:41,750
I was set to be a player in the previous life.

153
00:07:43,375 --> 00:07:45,917
I can't just stay here.

154
00:07:45,917 --> 00:07:48,042
I should find something to eat.

155
00:07:48,042 --> 00:07:50,292
Food is more important than anything.

156
00:07:50,292 --> 00:07:52,000
Let's go!

157
00:07:55,417 --> 00:08:00,042
There are many goblin-looking monsters.

158
00:08:00,042 --> 00:08:02,708
These monsters can't be living on earth.

159
00:08:02,708 --> 00:08:05,083
This has to be the Isekai.

160
00:08:05,833 --> 00:08:06,292
Identify!

161
00:08:06,292 --> 00:08:08,708
"DEER, BAT, WOLF."
Deer, bat, wolf.

162
00:08:08,708 --> 00:08:10,042
It hurts! Hold on!

163
00:08:10,042 --> 00:08:10,708
This is too much.

164
00:08:10,708 --> 00:08:13,500
So much information hurts my head.

165
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,250
Want me to break through this level?

166
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:17,583
To a newborn spider, doing such things

167
00:08:17,583 --> 00:08:20,375
is way too difficult.

168
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:23,458
I shall pretend that I haven't seen it.

169
00:08:24,583 --> 00:08:25,333
I want chocolate.

170
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:26,208
I want potato chips.

171
00:08:26,208 --> 00:08:28,500
I want ramen.

172
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:29,542
Anything is fine.

173
00:08:29,542 --> 00:08:32,375
I must find food immediately.

174
00:08:34,917 --> 00:08:36,917
There's human!

175
00:08:36,917 --> 00:08:38,292
Awesome!

176
00:08:38,292 --> 00:08:41,707
I'm a friendly, cheerful and cute spider baby.

177
00:08:41,707 --> 00:08:43,582
Can we be friends?

178
00:08:43,582 --> 00:08:45,875
Everyone, I'm harmless.

179
00:08:45,875 --> 00:08:47,792
Please help me!

180
00:08:49,333 --> 00:08:51,375
Hello, Brother Spider.

181
00:08:51,375 --> 00:08:52,833
Long time no see.

182
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:54,958
You look different.

183
00:08:54,958 --> 00:08:56,292
This can't go on.

184
00:08:56,292 --> 00:08:57,125
If I'm found by humans,

185
00:08:57,125 --> 00:08:59,083
I'll be killed.

186
00:08:59,083 --> 00:08:59,833
I actually think

187
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:01,125
I'm the one who will be destroyed.

188
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:03,500
Thank you so much.

189
00:09:03,917 --> 00:09:05,333
Oh no, this is bad!

190
00:09:05,333 --> 00:09:07,167
If I run into

191
00:09:07,167 --> 00:09:09,417
a human who's wandering in the dark...

192
00:09:12,083 --> 00:09:14,458
Is this my silk?

193
00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:16,875
I'm a spider. Of course I spin silk.

194
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:22,167
So I built my own house.

195
00:09:22,167 --> 00:09:24,917
Look at these firm and strong walls.

196
00:09:24,917 --> 00:09:25,625
Just in case,

197
00:09:25,625 --> 00:09:28,750
I also left a way for me to escape.

198
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:30,167
Nothing can go wrong.

199
00:09:30,167 --> 00:09:33,583
Now, I shall just wait for
a prey to fall into my web.

200
00:09:33,583 --> 00:09:37,250
So I can finally stay at home forever.

201
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:39,792
Although I had to go to school
every day in my previous life,

202
00:09:39,792 --> 00:09:42,542
I stayed at home all the time
besides school  time.

203
00:09:42,542 --> 00:09:45,458
I was a useless person
who were addicted to computer games.

204
00:09:45,458 --> 00:09:50,167
So perhaps the life of a spider suits me better.

205
00:09:50,167 --> 00:09:52,375
This useless person would like to tell everyone,

206
00:09:52,375 --> 00:09:54,333
being a cocoon at home is the best!

207
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:56,708
But I'm no longer a human.

208
00:09:59,708 --> 00:10:01,042
Weird.

209
00:10:01,042 --> 00:10:03,167
I can't move.

210
00:10:03,167 --> 00:10:04,458
Now that I think about it,

211
00:10:04,458 --> 00:10:07,500
I haven't eaten anything since I was born.

212
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,708
I tried to make a house using spider silk.

213
00:10:09,708 --> 00:10:12,792
In the end, I used up too much energy.

214
00:10:12,792 --> 00:10:15,417
If this goes on, I will die.

215
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:21,500
The only thing I can eat now is this.

216
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:25,375
I'm forced to do this, right?

217
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:27,417
I'm going to eat now.

218
00:10:35,417 --> 00:10:38,792
This tastes horrible and bitter.

219
00:10:38,792 --> 00:10:41,833
But I can't complain.

220
00:10:41,833 --> 00:10:44,792
Women must have perseverance.

221
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:49,583
This tastes horrible!

222
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:51,583
NAMELESS SPIDER

223
00:10:51,583 --> 00:10:53,625
SKILL: LEVEL ONE IDENTIFICATION SKILL. LEVEL ONE VENOMOUS FANG. 
LEVEL THREE SPIDER SILK. LEVEL NINE NIGHT VISION.

224
00:10:53,625 --> 00:10:55,667
LEVEL ONE VENOM-ENDURANCE.
LEVEL ONE WALKING SPEED.

225
00:10:56,708 --> 00:10:59,000
I'm full.

226
00:10:59,917 --> 00:11:03,125
It seems I don't have to worry about
being starved to death for now.

227
00:11:03,125 --> 00:11:05,000
Conditions met.

228
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,333
Cannibal title obtained.

229
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:10,375
Because of being a cannibal,

230
00:11:10,375 --> 00:11:16,083
level one exclusion
and level one Gaido magic are achieved.

231
00:11:16,083 --> 00:11:17,375
Title?

232
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:19,042
In the sense of games,

233
00:11:19,042 --> 00:11:22,417
it means I can get things by meeting conditions.

234
00:11:22,417 --> 00:11:23,167
CANNIBAL

235
00:11:23,167 --> 00:11:24,458
It looks cruel.

236
00:11:24,458 --> 00:11:26,833
It's obviously a bad title.

237
00:11:26,833 --> 00:11:29,333
"EXCLUSION AND GAIDO MAGIC
The names of these skills sound cool.

238
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:31,958
I got them without using any points.

239
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:33,625
That's good to know.

240
00:11:33,625 --> 00:11:35,292
LEVEL ONE EXCLUSION
That's a bad omen.

241
00:11:35,292 --> 00:11:38,167
Besides, what effect does it have?

242
00:11:38,167 --> 00:11:40,833
Is it bad if it's upgraded?

243
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:45,167
But I still don't know how to upgrade skills.

244
00:11:45,875 --> 00:11:47,708
I got them after so many difficulties.

245
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:50,208
I don't know how this and Gaido magic skill

246
00:11:50,208 --> 00:11:51,792
are used.

247
00:11:51,792 --> 00:11:55,167
Do I need spells for the magic?

248
00:11:55,167 --> 00:11:58,208
But I don't know magic spells.

249
00:11:58,208 --> 00:11:59,333
If that's the case...

250
00:11:59,333 --> 00:12:03,042
Gaido magic!

251
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,292
I get it.

252
00:12:08,292 --> 00:12:10,958
There must be many siblings

253
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:12,375
who have this title too, right?

254
00:12:12,375 --> 00:12:14,667
It's probably nothing special.

255
00:12:14,667 --> 00:12:16,375
A title obtained by meeting
such a simple condition

256
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:18,917
must have relatively low effect.

257
00:12:18,917 --> 00:12:23,167
But it's a deal to get a title
that comes with skills.

258
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:23,958
If I dance,

259
00:12:23,958 --> 00:12:26,833
can I get a dancer-title?

260
00:12:26,833 --> 00:12:32,792
I dance...

261
00:12:33,833 --> 00:12:35,667
It hurts.

262
00:12:37,667 --> 00:12:40,042
It seems like the spider web trapped something.

263
00:12:45,625 --> 00:12:46,833
I'm so nervous.

264
00:12:53,958 --> 00:12:56,208
It's a frog.

265
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:57,375
I think someone once told me

266
00:12:57,375 --> 00:13:00,500
that frog meat tastes
very similar to chicken meat.

267
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,167
Would it taste better?

268
00:13:05,375 --> 00:13:07,417
My eye!

269
00:13:07,417 --> 00:13:09,458
Is that venom?

270
00:13:09,458 --> 00:13:11,250
It's smoking.

271
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:15,042
I lost part of my vision.

272
00:13:15,042 --> 00:13:16,875
Oh right. Because I'm a spider

273
00:13:16,875 --> 00:13:19,167
I have many eyes.

274
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:23,292
I'm ruined!

275
00:13:25,583 --> 00:13:29,250
It hurts. Will my body melt?

276
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:31,833
Proficiency has achieved a certain level.

277
00:13:31,833 --> 00:13:36,583
Level one acid-resistance skill achieved.

278
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:38,750
The pain is eased.

279
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:43,542
"LEVEL ONE ACID-RESISTANCE SKILL"
Turns out I can get a skill like this as well.

280
00:13:43,542 --> 00:13:47,208
Why did I spend money
on identification skill then?

281
00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:52,958
How dare a meal challenge me?

282
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:54,333
Alright then.

283
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:57,292
I'll eat it even if it's beyond my capability.

284
00:13:57,292 --> 00:13:58,833
As long as I dodge carefully,

285
00:13:58,833 --> 00:14:00,417
it will just be a poor prey

286
00:14:00,417 --> 00:14:01,958
which fell into my trap.

287
00:14:02,333 --> 00:14:03,625
I know how you attack,

288
00:14:03,625 --> 00:14:05,833
so I can escape easily.

289
00:14:05,833 --> 00:14:07,250
Take this!

290
00:14:11,708 --> 00:14:13,000
It hurts!

291
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,792
Venom-endurance skill is upgraded to level two.

292
00:14:15,792 --> 00:14:19,833
This is not the time for this.

293
00:14:19,833 --> 00:14:21,167
Rotter.

294
00:14:21,167 --> 00:14:25,167
How dare you spit filthy things on me?

295
00:14:25,167 --> 00:14:30,042
Unforgivable! I will not let you off.

296
00:14:53,167 --> 00:14:54,500
Take this!

297
00:15:14,083 --> 00:15:16,167
I finally defeated it.

298
00:15:16,167 --> 00:15:17,167
The first prey is already tricky enough.

299
00:15:17,167 --> 00:15:19,833
I think my future will be tough.

300
00:15:21,667 --> 00:15:25,083
But looking at how this frog suffered,

301
00:15:25,083 --> 00:15:28,167
I think my bite is venomous.

302
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:31,125
This is great!

303
00:15:31,125 --> 00:15:32,625
I defeated it!

304
00:15:32,625 --> 00:15:34,625
This is great!

305
00:15:36,583 --> 00:15:39,792
My memorable first prey.

306
00:15:39,792 --> 00:15:44,083
It showed me that a prey of this size
can't escape the spider web

307
00:15:44,083 --> 00:15:48,083
and I can indeed catch preys.

308
00:15:48,083 --> 00:15:51,750
These are the frog's credits.

309
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:53,542
Thank you, frog.

310
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:55,625
However,

311
00:15:55,625 --> 00:15:58,375
I won't forget that you spit on me.

312
00:16:00,708 --> 00:16:02,875
Congratulations on your enrollment.

313
00:16:02,875 --> 00:16:06,000
You have to shoulder the future of our country,

314
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,667
be good physically and mentally,
be kind to others, be filial to parents,

315
00:16:10,667 --> 00:16:12,917
have a friendly heart

316
00:16:12,917 --> 00:16:16,083
and study hard to be cultured and reasonable.

317
00:16:22,875 --> 00:16:25,125
The one there is the prince of this country,

318
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:27,667
Mr. Schlain Zagan Analeit.

319
00:16:27,667 --> 00:16:29,875
It's said that he's a genius.

320
00:16:29,875 --> 00:16:32,792
However, he doesn't actually look that great.

321
00:16:32,792 --> 00:16:35,667
Be that as it may,
is there a way to get close to him?

322
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:38,917
You're so popular.

323
00:16:38,917 --> 00:16:40,958
Stop making fun of me.

324
00:16:42,792 --> 00:16:44,625
The one next to him is

325
00:16:44,625 --> 00:16:47,208
Ms. Karnatia Seri Anabald
from the Duke's family, right?

326
00:16:47,208 --> 00:16:49,292
Isn't she also a genius?

327
00:16:49,292 --> 00:16:50,958
She isn't just the daughter of the Duke,

328
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:53,583
she's also a genius who looks very cute.

329
00:16:53,583 --> 00:16:54,792
She's very pretty indeed.

330
00:16:54,792 --> 00:16:56,542
They say that you're cute.

331
00:16:56,542 --> 00:16:58,625
Don't call me that.

332
00:17:00,458 --> 00:17:03,833
Congratulations on your enrollment.

333
00:17:03,833 --> 00:17:05,208
It's Oka.

334
00:17:05,208 --> 00:17:08,333
Do not call your teacher by her nickname.

335
00:17:10,208 --> 00:17:12,458
Long time no see, Fei.

336
00:17:17,416 --> 00:17:19,707
You're also a freshman, right?

337
00:17:19,708 --> 00:17:21,583
Yes.

338
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:24,416
Teacher became student. This is weird.

339
00:17:24,416 --> 00:17:26,374
Do you think so?

340
00:17:26,375 --> 00:17:28,083
-Here, take a seat as well.
-Hold on.

341
00:17:28,083 --> 00:17:29,000
Sit.

342
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,375
I want to learn with everyone too.

343
00:17:31,375 --> 00:17:32,625
Fall in love together.

344
00:17:32,625 --> 00:17:34,708
It feels like I'm back to my youth.

345
00:17:34,708 --> 00:17:36,583
I'm so excited.

346
00:17:40,708 --> 00:17:44,083
May I know what's the matter?

347
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,292
Sue, what are you doing?

348
00:17:49,292 --> 00:17:51,000
I'm sorry, teacher.

349
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,542
She's Sue, my sister.

350
00:17:57,625 --> 00:17:59,833
You look so pretty.

351
00:18:00,542 --> 00:18:03,375
Brother, what's going on?
Who is this weird person?

352
00:18:03,375 --> 00:18:05,792
Sue, she's an elf,

353
00:18:05,792 --> 00:18:09,417
Ms. Filimøs, who will be studying with us
in this school from now on.

354
00:18:09,417 --> 00:18:12,375
Shun and I know her since awhile.

355
00:18:12,375 --> 00:18:13,833
She may look young.

356
00:18:13,833 --> 00:18:16,083
But that's because elves grow slower.

357
00:18:16,083 --> 00:18:19,167
She's actually our age.

358
00:18:19,167 --> 00:18:20,875
Nice to meet you.

359
00:18:22,625 --> 00:18:23,917
Nice to meet you.

360
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,125
Katia.

361
00:18:27,125 --> 00:18:30,208
Does brother like childish girls like her?

362
00:18:30,208 --> 00:18:32,750
No. Don't worry.

363
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:34,750
She's a reliable person.

364
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:38,167
Shun is being polite to her out of respect.

365
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:41,875
You two look close.

366
00:18:41,875 --> 00:18:44,458
Isn't that a bit too close?

367
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:46,458
Shun.

368
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:48,917
Have you done anything odd to your sister?

369
00:18:48,917 --> 00:18:50,458
No, I never did anything.

370
00:18:51,042 --> 00:18:52,042
Oh right.

371
00:18:52,042 --> 00:18:55,292
Sue, may I have two of them for awhile?

372
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,125
Teacher, could the people you want us to meet

373
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:03,042
be...

374
00:19:03,042 --> 00:19:06,500
Yes, just as you think.

375
00:19:07,583 --> 00:19:09,250
They're right there.

376
00:19:10,042 --> 00:19:12,917
Long time no see, the two of you.

377
00:19:14,292 --> 00:19:17,500
Hi, Oka. You're small as usual.

378
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:20,083
That's rude to say such things to the teacher.

379
00:19:20,083 --> 00:19:22,000
Long time no see, teacher.

380
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,625
Natsume and Hase are well.

381
00:19:23,625 --> 00:19:25,458
That's good to know.

382
00:19:26,667 --> 00:19:30,667
The one behind you is
the prince of this country, right?

383
00:19:30,667 --> 00:19:32,625
I forgot to introduce.

384
00:19:32,625 --> 00:19:37,708
These two are the future Sword King
and the future Saint.

385
00:19:37,708 --> 00:19:40,250
The crown prince of Renxandt Kingdom

386
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:43,500
and an important person
from Holy Kingdom of Alleius.

387
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:46,333
As you guessed, these two are

388
00:19:46,333 --> 00:19:50,625
the prince of this country
and the daughter of the Duke.

389
00:19:50,625 --> 00:19:52,375
Well, Oka,

390
00:19:52,375 --> 00:19:54,125
who are they actually?

391
00:19:54,125 --> 00:19:55,583
These two are...

392
00:19:55,583 --> 00:19:57,792
I'm Yamada Shunsuke.

393
00:19:57,792 --> 00:19:59,750
I'm Ooshima Kanata.

394
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:01,208
Long time no see.

395
00:20:01,917 --> 00:20:03,750
You're Ooshima?

396
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:05,792
Yes, I'm Ooshima.

397
00:20:05,792 --> 00:20:07,042
What a shock, right?

398
00:20:07,042 --> 00:20:09,208
I reincarnated as a girl.

399
00:20:11,292 --> 00:20:13,583
You're Ooshima?

400
00:20:13,583 --> 00:20:16,083
You became so cute.

401
00:20:16,083 --> 00:20:18,208
You look so much better now than before.

402
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:20,208
Horrible.

403
00:20:20,208 --> 00:20:22,667
I was quite depressed at the beginning.

404
00:20:22,667 --> 00:20:23,917
I think so too.

405
00:20:23,917 --> 00:20:27,667
If it were me, I might kill myself.

406
00:20:28,458 --> 00:20:31,792
That's enough, Natsume. You've gone too far.

407
00:20:31,792 --> 00:20:34,250
This child is also a reincarnation?

408
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:38,167
Long time no see. I'm Shinohara Mirei.

409
00:20:40,542 --> 00:20:43,375
Shinohara? Forget about gender.

410
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:45,667
You're an entirely different species.

411
00:20:45,667 --> 00:20:47,750
Leave me alone.

412
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:51,042
That means we might have
reincarnated as monsters.

413
00:20:51,042 --> 00:20:54,042
Oka, is there someone else like Shinohara?

414
00:20:54,042 --> 00:20:57,917
There are so far 11 people under my care now.

415
00:20:57,917 --> 00:21:00,500
None of them is monster.

416
00:21:01,833 --> 00:21:05,542
Perhaps you just haven't found them.

417
00:21:05,542 --> 00:21:06,917
Shinohara.

418
00:21:06,917 --> 00:21:10,292
Perhaps there's someone else
who's as unlucky as you.

419
00:21:10,292 --> 00:21:12,042
Don't give up.

420
00:21:13,167 --> 00:21:16,500
Alright. You guys must have a lot to talk about.

421
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:19,833
Let's talk while we enjoy the food.

422
00:21:19,833 --> 00:21:22,208
I'm so hungry.

423
00:21:22,208 --> 00:21:24,458
Haven't you been eating all the time?

424
00:21:24,458 --> 00:21:27,625
Fortunately, the food here is good.

425
00:21:27,625 --> 00:21:29,958
He's still a noisy person as before.

426
00:21:30,833 --> 00:21:33,042
Let's go eat as well.

427
00:21:33,042 --> 00:21:34,250
Okay.

428
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,542
This tastes horrible.

429
00:21:45,542 --> 00:21:48,958
Acid-resistance skill is upgraded to level two.

430
00:21:48,958 --> 00:21:52,667
It's bitter and painful.

431
00:21:52,667 --> 00:21:54,875
But horrible food is nothing.

432
00:21:54,875 --> 00:21:56,458
I have to survive!

433
00:21:56,458 --> 00:21:59,167
I eat in order to survive!

434
00:21:59,167 --> 00:22:00,667
I want to keep surviving

435
00:22:00,667 --> 00:22:02,875
as a spider in this world.

436
00:22:02,875 --> 00:22:05,917
I must survive!

437
00:22:09,042 --> 00:22:10,292
Do you know? This is the prelude.

438
00:22:10,292 --> 00:22:12,583
The life of a spider.

439
00:22:12,583 --> 00:22:14,167
I'm going to start singing.
