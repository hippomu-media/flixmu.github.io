1
00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:05,125
How much time do you spend
to play computer game each day?

2
00:00:05,125 --> 00:00:06,500
Not so much.

3
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:08,208
I stay up about three days each week.

4
00:00:08,208 --> 00:00:10,583
You will surely die soon.

5
00:00:16,207 --> 00:00:17,625
Aiya.

6
00:00:17,625 --> 00:00:19,583
Wakaba, sorry.

7
00:00:19,583 --> 00:00:21,917
It slipped off my hand.

8
00:00:25,792 --> 00:00:27,333
As if nothing happened.

9
00:00:27,333 --> 00:00:29,333
So annoying.

10
00:00:31,042 --> 00:00:35,083
EPISODE 2: MY HOUSE, ON FIRE?

00:00:51,292 --> 00:00:55,000

SO I'M A SPIDER, SO WHAT?

35
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:09,333
I'm so sleepy.

36
00:02:12,583 --> 00:02:15,083
Hi, Your Highness.

37
00:02:15,083 --> 00:02:17,042
It's Hugo.

38
00:02:17,042 --> 00:02:18,958
Aren't you a prince as well?

39
00:02:18,958 --> 00:02:21,500
Besides, you are different from me,
the fourth prince.

40
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:24,333
The crown prince of Renxandt, right?

41
00:02:25,458 --> 00:02:27,500
It suits me, right?

42
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:30,083
If someone out there had reincarnated me,

43
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:32,250
I would say he had taste.

44
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:35,792
I must be the person chosen by God.

45
00:02:36,625 --> 00:02:38,917
Talking about chosen by God,

46
00:02:38,917 --> 00:02:41,333
your brother is a warrior, right?

47
00:02:41,333 --> 00:02:42,958
That's right.

48
00:02:42,958 --> 00:02:45,667
Isn't he a reincarnation?

49
00:02:45,667 --> 00:02:48,083
Brother Julius isn't one.

50
00:02:48,083 --> 00:02:50,125
I have only heard about his legend.

51
00:02:50,125 --> 00:02:52,375
It's said he's a strong and great person.

52
00:02:52,375 --> 00:02:53,958
How is it actually?

53
00:02:53,958 --> 00:02:56,333
Brother is really powerful.

54
00:02:56,333 --> 00:02:59,250
Besides saving a village attacked by
a group of monsters,

55
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:02,250
he also took down the impossible dungeon.

56
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:05,167
Someone who defeated monsters of A level danger.

57
00:03:05,167 --> 00:03:07,958
He's indeed the strongest human.

58
00:03:07,958 --> 00:03:10,458
The strongest human?

59
00:03:10,458 --> 00:03:14,000
You're really obsessed with your brother.

60
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,083
Indeed.

61
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:17,333
I have a dream in this world,

62
00:03:17,333 --> 00:03:19,667
which is to fight hand-in-hand
with Brother Julius.

63
00:03:20,708 --> 00:03:24,125
Fighting hand-in-hand with the strongest human.

64
00:03:24,125 --> 00:03:26,583
What an unrealistic dream.

65
00:03:26,583 --> 00:03:29,583
That's right. I'm still far from it.

66
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,458
Work hard then.

67
00:03:33,833 --> 00:03:37,750
But the throne of the strongest human
will be inherited by me soon.

68
00:03:42,458 --> 00:03:44,458
Oh God.

69
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:46,625
Fei, what's going on?

70
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:49,417
I'm having my bad karma indeed.

71
00:03:49,417 --> 00:03:50,708
Bad karma?

72
00:03:50,708 --> 00:03:52,083
What does it mean?

73
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:54,083
Look at Hugo, you

74
00:03:54,083 --> 00:03:56,208
and other reincarnations.

75
00:03:56,208 --> 00:03:57,667
It's weird that

76
00:03:57,667 --> 00:03:59,917
I have reincarnated as a non-human.

77
00:03:59,917 --> 00:04:00,958
That's not true.

78
00:04:00,958 --> 00:04:03,042
That's true.

79
00:04:03,042 --> 00:04:06,208
Because you and Hugo are princes.

80
00:04:06,208 --> 00:04:09,083
Other reincarnations are not so bad either.

81
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:12,083
It's good enough to reincarnate as a human.

82
00:04:12,083 --> 00:04:15,083
But what does it have to do with bad karma?

83
00:04:15,083 --> 00:04:17,666
In my previous life,

84
00:04:17,666 --> 00:04:19,499
haven't I been bullying Wakaba?

85
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:24,667
That's why I'm the only one
who reincarnated as a pet.

86
00:04:24,667 --> 00:04:26,250
It must be so.

87
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:29,042
I'm not trying to atone.

88
00:04:29,042 --> 00:04:32,125
I just want to live this life seriously.

89
00:04:33,125 --> 00:04:36,000
But my owner was my schoolmate.

90
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,583
This is just a punishment game.

91
00:04:38,583 --> 00:04:39,708
I'm sorry

92
00:04:39,708 --> 00:04:41,833
that I look like a person
from a punishment game.

93
00:04:42,458 --> 00:04:44,375
I'm just kidding.

94
00:04:44,375 --> 00:04:46,625
Good morning.

95
00:04:46,625 --> 00:04:48,792
Good morning, teacher.

96
00:04:48,792 --> 00:04:52,875
Oka, you're looking for
other reincarnations, right?

97
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:54,208
That's right.

98
00:04:54,208 --> 00:04:56,792
But some people are not found yet.

99
00:04:57,625 --> 00:05:00,167
Have you found Wakaba?

100
00:05:01,083 --> 00:05:04,833
Wakaba Hiro, right?

101
00:05:04,833 --> 00:05:08,125
I still don't know where she is.

102
00:05:08,125 --> 00:05:09,625
I see.

103
00:05:09,625 --> 00:05:12,750
I wonder if her life is well
after reincarnation.

104
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:14,583
Don't worry.

105
00:05:14,583 --> 00:05:17,875
We came together without knowing it.

106
00:05:17,875 --> 00:05:20,000
We are well.

107
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,500
Wakaba will be well too.

108
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:27,042
It would be great if so.

109
00:05:32,542 --> 00:05:34,292
You again.

110
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:41,375
Don't you try to spit again.

111
00:05:48,167 --> 00:05:50,500
That's good enough.

112
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:54,542
Next, I'll bring it back to the safe house.

113
00:05:54,542 --> 00:05:56,375
Venomous fangs are upgraded to level two.

114
00:05:56,375 --> 00:05:57,792
PROFICIENCY ACHIEVED A CERTAIN LEVEL.
VENOMOUS FANGS LEVEL TWO.

115
00:05:57,792 --> 00:05:59,958
My skill level has upgraded.

116
00:05:59,958 --> 00:06:02,083
My venom is even stronger now.

117
00:06:04,458 --> 00:06:06,583
My body...

118
00:06:07,708 --> 00:06:10,375
Proficiency achieved a certain level.

119
00:06:10,375 --> 00:06:13,125
-Small lesser taratect.
-What is this?

120
00:06:13,125 --> 00:06:16,667
-Upgraded from level one to level two.
-Metamorphosis level.

121
00:06:16,667 --> 00:06:20,417
Skill proficiency level upgraded.
Skill points obtained.

122
00:06:20,417 --> 00:06:22,917
Acid-resistance skill
is upgraded to level three.

123
00:06:22,917 --> 00:06:25,958
Spider silk is upgraded to level four.

124
00:06:25,958 --> 00:06:28,042
You have obtained skill points.

125
00:06:28,042 --> 00:06:30,625
Hold on a second.

126
00:06:30,625 --> 00:06:33,375
What you mentioned just now is important, right?

127
00:06:33,375 --> 00:06:38,500
Hold on. Please repeat it.

128
00:06:40,917 --> 00:06:43,083
Let me think.

129
00:06:43,083 --> 00:06:45,625
That means, because my level is upgraded,

130
00:06:45,625 --> 00:06:48,417
that's why my body has been renewed?

131
00:06:48,417 --> 00:06:50,250
My body became so light.

132
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:52,792
My eye injury is healed as well.

133
00:06:52,792 --> 00:06:55,667
Damaged eyesight is recovered.

134
00:06:56,667 --> 00:06:59,833
I'm healed completely after a level upgrade.

135
00:06:59,833 --> 00:07:02,000
What an awesome benefit.

136
00:07:02,917 --> 00:07:06,542
This reminds me of the life in games.

137
00:07:06,542 --> 00:07:08,333
It's a little scary.

138
00:07:08,333 --> 00:07:10,500
But there's no time for regret now.

139
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:14,375
Because I'm already excited.

140
00:07:15,333 --> 00:07:17,583
Something is hooked again?

141
00:07:17,583 --> 00:07:20,083
What a great harvest today.

142
00:07:20,083 --> 00:07:22,000
I don't ask for much.

143
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,833
I only hope it's not another frog.

144
00:07:25,875 --> 00:07:29,500
Although I don't want a frog,

145
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:32,000
I didn't expect it to be a human.

146
00:07:35,042 --> 00:07:37,333
What is this person doing?

147
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:39,750
Hot!

148
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,583
What's going on?

149
00:07:49,542 --> 00:07:54,417
It seems my house isn't safe enough.

150
00:07:57,083 --> 00:07:59,542
Alright, I shall expand it.

151
00:08:19,042 --> 00:08:20,917
It's done.

152
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:22,708
Let me introduce.

153
00:08:22,708 --> 00:08:28,500
This is the house I expanded
and remodeled myself.

154
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,208
This is the kitchen.

155
00:08:30,208 --> 00:08:32,750
There's no water from the tap.

156
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:34,417
This is the living room.

157
00:08:34,417 --> 00:08:36,792
There's nothing showing on the TV.

158
00:08:36,792 --> 00:08:40,082
This is the sleeping room
that I'm most proud of.

159
00:08:40,082 --> 00:08:43,957
This soft pillow is my favourite.

160
00:08:43,957 --> 00:08:48,708
Because of all the previous lessons,
I've improved the disaster prevention measures.

161
00:08:48,708 --> 00:08:52,583
If a prey is caught in the web,
I'll be informed via these spider silks.

162
00:08:52,583 --> 00:08:55,000
They are set up in all directions.

163
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,583
In this case, even if anything happens,
I can respond immediately.

164
00:08:58,583 --> 00:09:02,417
It's so cozy. My home sweet home.

165
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,125
I'm hungry.

166
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:10,250
In order to celebrate my new house,

167
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:12,083
I shall go have a look at it.

168
00:09:12,083 --> 00:09:15,333
I've kept this for this special day,

169
00:09:15,333 --> 00:09:18,875
the eggs that the human risked his life to get.

170
00:09:18,875 --> 00:09:22,042
It must be a priceless treasure.

171
00:09:23,417 --> 00:09:26,917
It may be some delicious and precious food.

172
00:09:26,917 --> 00:09:28,500
It must be.

173
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,708
I'm going to eat now.

174
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,833
This thing is big and hard.

175
00:09:38,833 --> 00:09:42,042
However, I'm not a simple spider.

176
00:09:42,042 --> 00:09:44,917
Let me show you my wisdom as an ex-human.

177
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:46,125
Like this.

178
00:09:46,125 --> 00:09:47,208
Then like that.

179
00:09:47,208 --> 00:09:48,458
Next...

180
00:09:48,458 --> 00:09:49,917
Finally, like this.

181
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:53,375
Seriously?

182
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:55,000
It's so hard.

183
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,333
What is it made of?

184
00:09:57,333 --> 00:10:00,042
It's difficult to break this.

185
00:10:00,042 --> 00:10:03,583
Besides, what egg is this?

186
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:04,917
"EGG".
Egg.

187
00:10:04,917 --> 00:10:06,542
Who would have guessed?

188
00:10:06,542 --> 00:10:09,417
Identification skill is upgraded to level two.

189
00:10:09,417 --> 00:10:11,500
"IDENTIFICATION SKILL UPGRADED TO TWO"
My identification level has been upgraded.

190
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:16,292
"SMALL LESSER TARATECT"
Small lesser taratect. Nameless.

191
00:10:16,292 --> 00:10:18,833
The official name of my species has appeared.

192
00:10:18,833 --> 00:10:22,750
It's much better than level one.

193
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:27,542
But I'm actually small and lesser.

194
00:10:27,542 --> 00:10:30,958
It feels like I'm an inferior creature.

195
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:33,292
Whatever. My previous life
wasn't much better anyhow.

196
00:10:33,292 --> 00:10:34,792
It doesn't change anything even if I mind.

197
00:10:34,792 --> 00:10:37,208
Let's live up the spirit
to identify this egg again.

198
00:10:37,208 --> 00:10:38,625
Egg of earth dragon.

199
00:10:38,625 --> 00:10:39,583
"EGG OF EARTH DRAGON"
Earth dragon?

200
00:10:39,583 --> 00:10:40,667
Dragon?

201
00:10:40,667 --> 00:10:43,833
There's such a creature. This is Isekai indeed.

202
00:10:43,833 --> 00:10:48,083
It seems it's too soon
to be a dragon slayer now.

203
00:10:48,083 --> 00:10:51,375
I'll just keep it before I can break it.

204
00:11:01,792 --> 00:11:04,042
Almost all the spider silks are responding.

205
00:11:04,042 --> 00:11:06,000
It seems there are not just one or two of them.

206
00:11:12,917 --> 00:11:14,417
Fire!

207
00:11:15,917 --> 00:11:17,958
How did this happen?

208
00:11:17,958 --> 00:11:20,292
Torch. It's human.

209
00:11:20,292 --> 00:11:23,625
Are they here to get rid of me?

210
00:11:23,625 --> 00:11:26,000
If this goes on, I'll be burnt to death.

211
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,583
Humans are forcing me to the death end.
I have only two choices.

212
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:31,833
I'll go this way.

213
00:11:34,833 --> 00:11:36,167
The last spider web.

214
00:11:36,167 --> 00:11:38,000
I'll be safe after I cross this.

215
00:11:40,417 --> 00:11:42,792
There's no safe place here anymore.

216
00:11:51,667 --> 00:11:53,458
I have no choice.

217
00:11:53,458 --> 00:11:56,292
When facing opponents
that can break through spider web,

218
00:11:56,292 --> 00:11:58,708
I can only run.

219
00:12:03,792 --> 00:12:06,083
I'm not reconciled. I'm useless.

220
00:12:06,083 --> 00:12:08,542
I hate that I can only run away.

221
00:12:10,417 --> 00:12:12,375
Unforgivable.

222
00:12:12,375 --> 00:12:14,667
I hate that I can only run away.

223
00:12:14,667 --> 00:12:18,750
I hate myself for being so weak.

224
00:12:23,083 --> 00:12:25,208
In my previous life,

225
00:12:25,208 --> 00:12:27,708
there was no place for me at all.

226
00:12:27,708 --> 00:12:30,125
I couldn't conform to the life in school.

227
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:32,125
My family fell apart.

228
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:35,000
That's my home.

229
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,667
Mine...

230
00:12:36,667 --> 00:12:38,500
Mine alone.

231
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:42,167
That place belongs to me.

232
00:12:42,167 --> 00:12:45,875
I don't want to run away anymore.

233
00:12:45,875 --> 00:12:47,917
I don't want to be defeated.

234
00:12:47,917 --> 00:12:49,375
I want to be strong.

235
00:12:49,375 --> 00:12:51,750
I must be strong.

236
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:55,208
In order to not let others take away my pride,

237
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:58,333
I have to raise and keep living.

238
00:12:58,333 --> 00:12:59,875
In order to reach my goal,

239
00:12:59,875 --> 00:13:02,250
I have to get actual combat experience.

240
00:13:05,833 --> 00:13:07,417
LEVEL TWO NAMELESS SMALL LESSER TARATECT.
TITLE: CANNIBAL

241
00:13:07,417 --> 00:13:08,833
SKILL: LEVEL 2 IDENTIFICATION SKILL. LEVEL 2 VENOMOUS FANGS.
LEVEL 4 SPIDER SILK. LEVEL 9 NIGHT VISION.

242
00:13:08,833 --> 00:13:10,000
LEVEL 2 VENOM-ENDURANCE SKILL.
LEVEL 2 ACID-RESISTANCE SKILL. LEVEL 1 EXCLUSION. LEVEL 1 GAIDO MAGIC

243
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,708
WALKING SPEED

244
00:13:28,583 --> 00:13:33,375
In order to upgrade my levels, I've been
fighting countless monsters in the past days.

245
00:13:33,375 --> 00:13:35,125
I...

246
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:37,375
am so weak!

247
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:43,542
LEVEL SEVEN SMALL LESSER TARATECT

248
00:13:43,542 --> 00:13:45,083
"NAMELESS. WEAK STATUS."
Stupid thing.

249
00:13:45,083 --> 00:13:46,458
"WEAK"
What has my weakness to do with you?

250
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:48,917
I'm happy that
my identification level has upgraded.

251
00:13:48,917 --> 00:13:51,375
But what do you mean by weak? You're annoying.

252
00:13:51,375 --> 00:13:53,625
I'm very weak indeed.

253
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:57,125
But that's the problem of my fighting style.

254
00:13:57,125 --> 00:13:59,125
Although I was badly hit,

255
00:13:59,125 --> 00:14:01,125
I still won at the end.

256
00:14:01,125 --> 00:14:05,833
But I didn't expect a frog could put me
into such a bitter fight.

257
00:14:05,833 --> 00:14:07,833
Because I have only been killing my trapped prey

258
00:14:07,833 --> 00:14:10,083
by biting with my venomous fang.

259
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:11,875
Hence I didn't know that

260
00:14:11,875 --> 00:14:14,208
they're actually quite strong.

261
00:14:14,208 --> 00:14:16,167
Or is it because I'm too weak?

262
00:14:16,167 --> 00:14:17,292
Lizard should be like lizard.

263
00:14:17,292 --> 00:14:19,833
Yet they could use special technique
to petrify their opponents.

264
00:14:19,833 --> 00:14:23,917
Fortunately I could remove the petrification
after a level upgrade.

265
00:14:23,917 --> 00:14:26,417
If I couldn't recover...

266
00:14:26,417 --> 00:14:27,125
It's okay.

267
00:14:27,125 --> 00:14:31,500
I have wrapped both of them in spider silks
and killed them with venomous bites.

268
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:32,833
On the other hand,

269
00:14:32,833 --> 00:14:36,750
I still couldn't fight my opponents in a duel
openly with bare hands.

270
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:40,000
Because my status is weak.

271
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,292
Now that I recall all my fights,

272
00:14:42,292 --> 00:14:45,333
my strengths are only
spider silks and venomous fangs.

273
00:14:45,333 --> 00:14:47,208
Figure a way to entangle with spider silks

274
00:14:47,208 --> 00:14:48,667
then kill with venomous fangs.

275
00:14:48,667 --> 00:14:50,125
Only these two styles.

276
00:14:51,042 --> 00:14:55,542
But how to entangle with spider silks
is also a problem.

277
00:14:57,167 --> 00:14:59,250
There are so many problems.

278
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:02,333
But I've decided to raise and keep living.

279
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:04,750
I can't just flinch.

280
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:09,208
Alright. Lift the spirit again to discover
the labyrinth that I haven't visited for so long.

281
00:15:09,917 --> 00:15:12,375
There's a chance to attack from the back.

282
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I get it now.

283
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,833
I could use spider silks to be preemptive.

284
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:19,167
Sneak attack.

285
00:15:19,167 --> 00:15:20,750
What? Despicable?

286
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:23,083
As long as I can win.

287
00:15:26,167 --> 00:15:27,542
What?

288
00:15:28,917 --> 00:15:31,708
Is there something down there?

289
00:15:34,167 --> 00:15:36,250
"LEVEL TWO ELROE FERECT"

290
00:15:37,125 --> 00:15:39,042
My head hurts.

291
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:44,833
Identification skill is upgraded to level five.

292
00:15:48,625 --> 00:15:50,542
Something is coming.

293
00:15:55,417 --> 00:15:57,792
They're coming after me!

294
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:01,333
Is SP stamina?

295
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:04,667
But there's no time for that now.

296
00:16:04,667 --> 00:16:09,000
In order not to be killed, I have to run!

297
00:16:13,375 --> 00:16:16,042
I finally got rid of them.

298
00:16:16,042 --> 00:16:18,917
Could it be that I run very quickly?

299
00:16:18,917 --> 00:16:21,292
I didn't expect such a big group of them.

300
00:16:21,292 --> 00:16:22,583
But there's no wonder.

301
00:16:22,583 --> 00:16:26,458
Monsters need to find a way to survive as well.

302
00:16:26,458 --> 00:16:31,000
They rely on collective strength
to fight enemies.

303
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,833
On the other hand, what should I do?

304
00:16:33,833 --> 00:16:38,500
Without changing the use of spider silks
and venomous fangs,

305
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:39,542
I have additional sneak attack

306
00:16:39,542 --> 00:16:43,333
and the agile movement I got to know just now.

307
00:16:43,333 --> 00:16:46,708
I shall just entangle my enemy
with spider silks after a sneak attack.

308
00:16:46,708 --> 00:16:48,708
If that doesn't work, I'll use my agile speed.

309
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:53,292
While running away from the enemy,
I'll find a chance to entangle it.

310
00:16:54,042 --> 00:16:55,792
I came up with a strategy!

311
00:16:55,792 --> 00:16:58,917
However, I shall rest today.

312
00:17:01,542 --> 00:17:05,666
As long as I have these spider silks,

313
00:17:05,666 --> 00:17:07,707
I can defeat my opponents.

314
00:17:07,708 --> 00:17:10,375
Or not?

315
00:17:16,625 --> 00:17:18,458
What's going on?

316
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:22,917
Oh no.

317
00:17:25,708 --> 00:17:27,791
Although I don't know what's going on,

318
00:17:27,791 --> 00:17:29,708
I have a bad hunch.

319
00:17:31,625 --> 00:17:32,167
LEVEL NINE ELROE BALADORADO
STATUS IDENTIFICATION FAILED.

320
00:17:34,625 --> 00:17:38,333
It's so huge! And it's level nine.

321
00:17:38,333 --> 00:17:40,792
If I don't deal with it seriously,
my chance of winning...

322
00:17:40,792 --> 00:17:41,792
will be zero.

323
00:17:42,667 --> 00:17:43,875
I can't stay in an open place.

324
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:45,542
I must get into narrow passages.

325
00:17:46,125 --> 00:17:48,750
Spider webs and walls are useless.

326
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:51,333
It's better to run.

327
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:53,375
I won't run.

328
00:17:53,375 --> 00:17:56,250
I already know how to fight.

329
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:58,583
I will try my best to show my skills.

330
00:17:59,292 --> 00:18:00,833
Even if it can break the spider silks,

331
00:18:00,833 --> 00:18:03,292
I can still entangle it.

332
00:18:03,292 --> 00:18:04,500
If that's the case...

333
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,708
I'm right here.

334
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,833
It's not just big, it's also fast.

335
00:18:10,833 --> 00:18:12,458
This isn't fair.

336
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:15,458
But my speed isn't worse than its.

337
00:18:15,458 --> 00:18:17,375
Now another side.

338
00:18:19,583 --> 00:18:20,792
Once again.

339
00:18:22,208 --> 00:18:25,917
Yes! I have sealed its mouth.

340
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:40,958
I will not be killed by you.

341
00:18:40,958 --> 00:18:42,583
Bite!

342
00:18:50,958 --> 00:18:52,792
I will not let go.

343
00:18:52,792 --> 00:18:56,250
Fall. Fast.

344
00:19:16,708 --> 00:19:18,375
Yes!

345
00:19:18,375 --> 00:19:19,917
Did you see that?

346
00:19:19,917 --> 00:19:22,750
I won even though I'm weak.

347
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:25,333
Experience achieved a certain level.

348
00:19:25,333 --> 00:19:27,625
Level is upgraded to tenth.

349
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:31,083
Skill points obtained.

350
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:34,125
Proficiency achieved a certain target.

351
00:19:34,125 --> 00:19:36,458
Skill. Spider silk is upgraded to level seven.

352
00:19:36,458 --> 00:19:38,417
Venomous fangs are upgraded to level six.

353
00:19:38,417 --> 00:19:40,458
Night vision is upgraded to level ten.

354
00:19:40,458 --> 00:19:43,958
Pain endurance is upgraded to level two.

355
00:19:43,958 --> 00:19:46,292
Conditions met.

356
00:19:46,292 --> 00:19:48,917
Skills derived from night vision.

357
00:19:48,917 --> 00:19:50,958
-Visual field expanded to level one.
-Upgraded to level ten in an instant?

358
00:19:50,958 --> 00:19:53,083
And so many skills are upgraded.

359
00:19:53,083 --> 00:19:56,625
My experience will of course increase
when I defeat a strong opponent.

360
00:19:56,625 --> 00:19:58,875
This is the reward of my hard work.

361
00:19:58,875 --> 00:20:00,875
Conditions met.

362
00:20:00,875 --> 00:20:03,708
Small lesser taratect

363
00:20:03,708 --> 00:20:05,250
may evolve.

364
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:08,083
What did you say? Evolve?

365
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:11,208
There are two choices of evolution.

366
00:20:11,208 --> 00:20:13,125
Please choose from below options.

367
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:14,667
"EVOLUTION OPTIONS"
Hold on a second.

368
00:20:14,667 --> 00:20:16,375
"LESSER TARATECT AND SMALL TARATECT"
I need think this through.

369
00:20:16,375 --> 00:20:18,208
This is the turning point.

370
00:20:18,208 --> 00:20:20,375
I can't make a random decision.

371
00:20:20,375 --> 00:20:23,583
What should I do?

372
00:20:23,583 --> 00:20:27,333
If I choose lesser,
then I will grow up as a lesser creature.

373
00:20:27,333 --> 00:20:32,458
If I choose small, I may become
an advanced creature, but will I stay small?

374
00:20:34,083 --> 00:20:37,833
Okay. Please let me evolve
to be a small taratect.

375
00:20:37,833 --> 00:20:40,625
I don't want to keep evolving
as a lesser creature.

376
00:20:40,625 --> 00:20:45,167
If I lose my current flexibility and speed,
I will be sad too.

377
00:20:45,167 --> 00:20:48,000
Evolve to a small taratect.

378
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,792
Is it going to start now?

379
00:20:49,792 --> 00:20:56,208
Let me have more time.

380
00:21:00,042 --> 00:21:01,292
Do you know? This is the prelude.

381
00:21:01,292 --> 00:21:03,583
The life of a spider.

382
00:21:03,583 --> 00:21:05,167
I'm going to start singing.

Fei.

432
00:22:32,625 --> 00:22:34,958
Hey, Fei.

433
00:22:34,958 --> 00:22:36,708
What's going on?

434
00:22:36,708 --> 00:22:39,792
It seems earth dragon has
many types of evolution.

435
00:22:39,792 --> 00:22:41,208
Have a look.

436
00:22:45,583 --> 00:22:47,458
Let me see.

437
00:22:47,458 --> 00:22:49,292
If I were to evolve,

438
00:22:49,292 --> 00:22:51,042
I would evolve into this.

439
00:22:51,042 --> 00:22:53,917
This is not just cool, but also strong.

440
00:22:55,667 --> 00:22:57,333
Don't you like it?

441
00:22:57,333 --> 00:22:59,958
Do you think a woman care

442
00:22:59,958 --> 00:23:03,042
to be cool and strong?

443
00:23:03,917 --> 00:23:05,875
That's true.

444
00:23:05,875 --> 00:23:07,000
Sorry.

445
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,083
You don't have to apologise.

446
00:23:09,083 --> 00:23:10,875
I'm just a dragon.

447
00:23:10,875 --> 00:23:13,750
Of course I have to be on the strong side.

448
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:14,917
By the way,

449
00:23:14,917 --> 00:23:17,625
there are earth dragons around here recently.

450
00:23:18,417 --> 00:23:19,958
They are rare.

451
00:23:19,958 --> 00:23:22,292
They appeared in a forest near the school.

452
00:23:22,292 --> 00:23:24,042
Furthermore, someone was killed.

453
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,083
Although I can't do anything about it,

454
00:23:28,083 --> 00:23:30,417
I still feel bad that

455
00:23:30,417 --> 00:23:32,333
creatures of my race killed someone.

456
00:23:32,333 --> 00:23:35,167
I hope there will be no victim anymore.

457
00:23:36,333 --> 00:23:39,000
SO I'M A SPIDER, SO WHAT?
NEXT EPISODE: EARTH DRAGON, DANGEROUS?

458
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,458
STAY TUNED
