1
00:00:01,292 --> 00:00:04,000
How did this happen?

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,458
Mythical Beast.

3
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:13,208
Have you seen It?

4
00:00:13,208 --> 00:00:15,917
Of course. I've seen It thrice.

5
00:00:15,917 --> 00:00:17,708
I've seen It 15 times.

6
00:00:17,708 --> 00:00:20,667
I brought my entire family to meet It yesterday.

7
00:00:20,667 --> 00:00:24,042
Now that the Mythical Beast is here,
this country will be in peace.

8
00:00:24,042 --> 00:00:26,167
What a cheerful event.

9
00:00:26,167 --> 00:00:28,417
Long live, Mythical Beast.

10
00:00:28,417 --> 00:00:31,833
Why do they think I'm the Aura?

11
00:00:31,833 --> 00:00:34,625
Please carry my baby.

12
00:00:34,625 --> 00:00:37,958
Stop it. Is this a sacrifice?

13
00:00:37,958 --> 00:00:43,042
Mythical Beast Doll, Mythical Beast Handbag
and Mythical Beast Cookies.

14
00:00:43,042 --> 00:00:44,042
The customer over there...

15
00:00:44,042 --> 00:00:47,417
-Why are you selling my merchandise?
-Have a good look.

16
00:00:47,417 --> 00:00:51,708
But these dolls are really cute.
They may be used as charms.

17
00:00:53,208 --> 00:00:55,667
What a sacred gesture.

18
00:00:55,667 --> 00:00:58,583
Because my figure is exquisite.

19
00:00:58,583 --> 00:01:03,208
No. I'm lonely.
I was lonely in my previous life as well.

20
00:01:03,208 --> 00:01:05,167
Up until now I'm lonely.

21
00:01:05,167 --> 00:01:07,833
I'm a lonely creature.

22
00:01:10,417 --> 00:01:13,042
The Mythical Beast is telling us something.

23
00:01:13,042 --> 00:01:16,167
It's a proclamation.

24
00:01:16,167 --> 00:01:21,000
No, it's not.
I've always been bad in communicating.

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,542
That's true.
I'm never able to have casual conversation.

26
00:01:23,542 --> 00:01:29,375
Mythical Beast, the weather today is great.

27
00:01:29,375 --> 00:01:31,083
So what?

28
00:01:31,083 --> 00:01:34,250
♫The alarm goes off. My name is Little Spider♫

29
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:36,667
EPISODE 19: I GUESS, THIS IS A CLASS REUNION?
♫The awakening survival skill♫

30
00:01:36,667 --> 00:01:37,250
EPISODE 19: I GUESS, THIS IS A CLASS REUNION?
♫No obstacles can stop me♫

31
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:40,500
♫No obstacles can stop me♫

32
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,042
♫Go! Dark clouds♫

33
00:01:52,958 --> 00:01:55,458
♫Sometimes I pretend it's fate♫

34
00:01:55,458 --> 00:01:58,208
♫The 3-D perspective street that
appears in the intersection of good and evil♫

35
00:01:58,208 --> 00:02:01,083
♫The labyrinth of nightmares is nothing to me♫

36
00:02:01,083 --> 00:02:03,833
♫Common sense isn't useful here♫

37
00:02:03,833 --> 00:02:08,917
♫Charging forward like a man is naive♫

38
00:02:08,917 --> 00:02:13,500
♫Because life isn't as easy as you think♫

39
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:17,000
♫It drives me forward♫

40
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,333
♫These hands created a brave me♫

41
00:02:22,333 --> 00:02:24,667
♫Excuse me, I'm the strongest!♫

42
00:02:24,667 --> 00:02:28,000

♫Loosen the knot in your heart♫

♫So you can jump right

50
00:03:07,125 --> 00:03:09,000
Isn't this a dead end?

51
00:03:16,333 --> 00:03:17,917
A Teleport Formation...

52
00:03:17,917 --> 00:03:21,375
The Elf Village is guarded
by a powerful barrier.

53
00:03:21,375 --> 00:03:24,667
Without this Teleport Formation,
one can never enter.

54
00:03:24,667 --> 00:03:28,750
So this is the entrance of Elf Village.

55
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:33,208
Please don't give this away. Let's go.

56
00:03:50,792 --> 00:03:54,333
Hold on a second. I brought them.

57
00:03:54,333 --> 00:03:55,792
Name.

58
00:03:55,792 --> 00:03:57,625
Filimøs Harrifenas.

59
00:03:57,625 --> 00:04:02,708
The daughter of the clan leader.
Why did you bring humans here?

60
00:04:02,708 --> 00:04:09,583
They're reincarnations, the comrades of the
true Warrior, those who help the Imperial Army.

61
00:04:11,958 --> 00:04:16,083
I know what's going on.
But I can't let humans in the village.

62
00:04:16,083 --> 00:04:16,583
Why...

63
00:04:16,583 --> 00:04:19,333
Don't make me repeat my words. Please leave.

64
00:04:19,958 --> 00:04:21,750
Put your sword down.

65
00:04:25,292 --> 00:04:26,667
You are...

66
00:04:26,667 --> 00:04:29,167
Did you forget your father's face?

67
00:04:29,167 --> 00:04:30,667
Potimas?

68
00:04:30,667 --> 00:04:32,417
This isn't real.

69
00:04:32,417 --> 00:04:34,583
Why are you...

70
00:04:34,583 --> 00:04:41,500
There are many ways to avoid death.
In some extent, I won't die.

71
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:44,417
Welcome to the Elf Village.

72
00:04:44,417 --> 00:04:48,750
Follow me. Although it's simple,
I've prepared a welcoming banquet.

73
00:04:53,708 --> 00:04:55,750
How about the direction of the Imperial Army?

74
00:04:55,750 --> 00:05:01,542
They haven't reached the barrier.
They're still in the forest.

75
00:05:01,542 --> 00:05:02,417
How many of them?

76
00:05:02,417 --> 00:05:03,875
About 80,000 people.

77
00:05:03,875 --> 00:05:08,333
80,000? They're fighting
the Demon Clan with so few people?

78
00:05:08,333 --> 00:05:12,667
If Demon Clan knows about this,
they will surely take advantage of this chance.

79
00:05:12,667 --> 00:05:16,708
The tricky part is, the church
has also contributed a lot to the troop.

80
00:05:16,708 --> 00:05:22,417
After Hugo was announced as the fake Warrior,
their relation with the empire became firmer.

81
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:27,875
I've prepared accommodation.
After the meal, I'll bring you there.

82
00:05:27,875 --> 00:05:30,292
Thank you for your care.

83
00:05:30,292 --> 00:05:33,000
Tomorrow you can go see your friends.

84
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:33,875
Friends?

85
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:35,917
The reincarnations.

86
00:05:35,917 --> 00:05:37,375
Reincarnations?

87
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:46,625
What do you think?

88
00:05:46,625 --> 00:05:47,875
Think what?

89
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:51,625
Potimas. The house is ready as well.
He's too well prepared.

90
00:05:51,625 --> 00:05:55,042
Yes. As if he knew that we're coming.

91
00:05:55,042 --> 00:05:58,500
That old man is suspicious.

92
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,500
We better be careful.

93
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:01,958
Same goes to the teacher.

94
00:06:01,958 --> 00:06:02,500
What?

95
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:08,625
We shouldn't trust her so much.
She might be giving away our whereabouts.

96
00:06:08,625 --> 00:06:10,333
How is it possible?

97
00:06:10,333 --> 00:06:13,500
Wasn't she also shocked when she saw Potimas?

98
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:16,167
She might have been putting on a show.

99
00:06:26,667 --> 00:06:30,375
Teacher, how many hours do we have to walk?

100
00:06:30,375 --> 00:06:34,500
We're almost there. Elf Village is very huge.

101
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:39,500
Going from one end to another requires a day.

102
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:42,375
A barrier that covers such a large area.

103
00:06:42,375 --> 00:06:44,375
It seems you have very powerful magic.

104
00:06:44,375 --> 00:06:49,125
Thanks to this barrier,
Elf Village hasn't been attacked until now.

105
00:06:49,958 --> 00:06:54,375
It's said, we don't even have to
be afraid of the Queen Taratect's attack.

106
00:06:54,375 --> 00:06:59,500
Such a strong barrier. Can Hugo destroy it?

107
00:07:00,625 --> 00:07:04,542
No one can guarantee that it won't be destroyed.

108
00:07:04,542 --> 00:07:07,917
Are you talking about the killer's move of Hugo?

109
00:07:07,917 --> 00:07:13,250
I don't know either. This barrier is well-known.

110
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:15,750
If one isn't confident to break through it...

111
00:07:16,917 --> 00:07:18,750
We can see it now.

112
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:21,500
That's the protected area of reincarnations.

113
00:07:27,542 --> 00:07:29,417
Teacher, you're back.

114
00:07:29,417 --> 00:07:31,375
Yes, I'm back.

115
00:07:31,375 --> 00:07:34,375
Are these three the new victims?

116
00:07:34,375 --> 00:07:37,250
They're not victims.

117
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,417
Our views are different.

118
00:07:40,417 --> 00:07:45,625
At least to me, you're the perpetrator.

119
00:07:49,042 --> 00:07:52,875
Whatever. What's their names?

120
00:07:52,875 --> 00:07:57,208
That feeling...
Am I the only one who thinks about that person?

121
00:07:57,208 --> 00:07:58,792
To be honest, me too.

122
00:07:58,792 --> 00:08:00,750
Me too.

123
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:04,917
I'm not talking about the name of this world,
but the other world.

124
00:08:04,917 --> 00:08:08,792
It's obvious, right? I'm Shinohara Mirei.

125
00:08:08,792 --> 00:08:10,667
Indeed.

126
00:08:10,667 --> 00:08:12,167
I'm Yamada Shunsuke.

127
00:08:12,167 --> 00:08:15,000
I'm Ooshima Kanata.

128
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,208
Hold on. You're Ooshima?

129
00:08:17,208 --> 00:08:18,833
Indeed.

130
00:08:19,792 --> 00:08:22,875
What kind of reaction is that? That's rude.

131
00:08:22,875 --> 00:08:25,250
Sorry. That was unexpected.

132
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:29,667
Hey, we've told you our names.
Shouldn't you tell us yours?

133
00:08:29,667 --> 00:08:34,000
That was rude indeed. I'm Kudo Sachi.

134
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,625
Indeed... The chairman.

135
00:08:36,625 --> 00:08:41,000
Shinohara, why do you look so much
like you in the previous life?

136
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,167
Who knows?
Perhaps I was loathe to let my beauty die.

137
00:08:45,167 --> 00:08:47,208
Don't talk to yourself.

138
00:08:47,208 --> 00:08:49,583
You're as straightforward as ever.

139
00:08:49,583 --> 00:08:51,125
Mirei, really?

140
00:08:51,125 --> 00:08:52,250
Is that her?

141
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:54,500
Could that be Ai and Kumi?

142
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,583
That's right!

143
00:08:55,583 --> 00:08:58,417
It's Mirei! Long time no see.

144
00:08:58,417 --> 00:09:01,167
We've died once. That was indeed long.

145
00:09:01,167 --> 00:09:03,333
By the way, they're Yamada and Ooshima.

146
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:05,042
You're lying. Ooshima?

147
00:09:05,042 --> 00:09:06,583
Impossible.

148
00:09:06,583 --> 00:09:09,542
-Right?
-Didn't I say that was rude?

149
00:09:09,542 --> 00:09:12,250
Let's not talk standing.

150
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:14,083
Our work today is complete.

151
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:17,250
-You may rest now.
-It's complete. Yay!

152
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:20,875
Teacher, you want to come?
Although we don't welcome you.

153
00:09:24,417 --> 00:09:30,958
That's right. You finally got together.
If I'm around, you won't be happy.

154
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:33,125
I'm not coming.

155
00:09:36,292 --> 00:09:39,792
Weren't Oka and Kudo close back then?

156
00:09:39,792 --> 00:09:40,792
Yes.

157
00:09:40,792 --> 00:09:42,042
Let's go.

158
00:09:44,042 --> 00:09:45,708
Let's go, Shun.

159
00:09:50,708 --> 00:09:53,208
Shun and Kanata?

160
00:09:53,208 --> 00:09:54,708
Could you be Ogi?

161
00:09:54,708 --> 00:09:59,000
Yes, Ogiwara Kenichi. Long time no see.
You recognise people well.

162
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,208
No one is as enthusiastic as you.

163
00:10:02,208 --> 00:10:08,250
Let's introduce ourselves, our previous selves.

164
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:10,125
Aikawa.

165
00:10:10,125 --> 00:10:12,458
Maki Shouwato.

166
00:10:12,458 --> 00:10:13,875
Furuta Mio.

167
00:10:13,875 --> 00:10:15,208
Nanase Chie.

168
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:16,708
Segawa Shuuko.

169
00:10:16,708 --> 00:10:19,333
Temarikawa Saki.

170
00:10:19,333 --> 00:10:21,167
Tsushima Dai.

171
00:10:21,167 --> 00:10:23,083
Tagawa Kunihiko.

172
00:10:23,083 --> 00:10:24,958
Kushitani Asaka.

173
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:29,750
They just arrived recently.
They were adventurers.

174
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:32,333
Ijima Aiko.

175
00:10:32,333 --> 00:10:33,875
Tonooka Kumiko.

176
00:10:33,875 --> 00:10:35,208
Yes, yes.

177
00:10:35,208 --> 00:10:37,917
That's everyone.

178
00:10:37,917 --> 00:10:40,417
A total of 13?

179
00:10:40,417 --> 00:10:45,625
Two more than Oka told us.
Are those Tagawa and Asaka?

180
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:47,375
By the way...

181
00:10:47,375 --> 00:10:50,667
Kanata, why did you become such a beauty?

182
00:10:50,667 --> 00:10:52,833
I'm asking that too.

183
00:10:52,833 --> 00:10:55,500
Am I the only one that has a different gender?

184
00:10:55,500 --> 00:11:00,625
At least you're still a human. I'm a monster.

185
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,250
So what?

186
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:04,333
Stop it.

187
00:11:05,417 --> 00:11:08,083
Natsume wants to attack us?

188
00:11:08,083 --> 00:11:09,083
Yes.

189
00:11:09,083 --> 00:11:11,792
Not only Natsume.

190
00:11:11,792 --> 00:11:15,333
They have Yuri as well. No, I mean Hasebe.

191
00:11:15,333 --> 00:11:16,417
Yuika?

192
00:11:16,417 --> 00:11:18,375
She seems to be brainwashed.

193
00:11:19,667 --> 00:11:22,917
Wouldn't the elves tell you
about the outside news?

194
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:28,375
Yes. The elves try not to be related to us.

195
00:11:28,375 --> 00:11:30,833
What's with the silence?

196
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:35,333
No. Because I can't associate
such a beauty with Kanata.

197
00:11:35,333 --> 00:11:36,417
No, sorry.

198
00:11:36,417 --> 00:11:38,583
I find it hard to converse.

199
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:43,958
Okay. If you mind,
I shall move to the girls' side.

200
00:11:46,292 --> 00:11:48,500
Please stay here.

201
00:11:49,917 --> 00:11:52,958
Well, what do you think about this village?

202
00:11:55,542 --> 00:11:57,667
It feels like we're kidnapped here.

203
00:11:57,667 --> 00:11:59,208
Kidnapped?

204
00:11:59,208 --> 00:12:03,542
Although our situations were different,
basically we were sold by our parents.

205
00:12:03,542 --> 00:12:07,542
It was worse for Temarikawa Saki,
who was basically abducted here.

206
00:12:07,542 --> 00:12:10,208
To a certain extent, this is expected.

207
00:12:10,208 --> 00:12:14,542
Didn't I mention it?
The teacher is the perpetrator.

208
00:12:14,542 --> 00:12:18,667
Don't you say such things
as killing isn't allowed.

209
00:12:18,667 --> 00:12:21,458
Haven't you killed many people as well?

210
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:25,750
She said she's protecting us,
but she's just putting us on house arrest.

211
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:29,583
Besides giving us resources,
she doesn't care about us.

212
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:33,167
I can't trust the elves and the teacher.

213
00:12:34,875 --> 00:12:39,417
Does anyone know about Kyouya? Sasajima Kyouya.

214
00:12:39,417 --> 00:12:41,125
Sasajima Kyouya?

215
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:43,625
We don't know.

216
00:12:43,625 --> 00:12:47,417
What about Tagawa and Kushitani?
Don't adventurers go around?

217
00:12:47,417 --> 00:12:50,417
No. We don't know either.

218
00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:52,917
I see.

219
00:12:54,542 --> 00:12:58,208
We've met almost all the reincarnations.

220
00:12:58,208 --> 00:13:00,583
There are two left.

221
00:13:00,583 --> 00:13:01,667
Yes.

222
00:13:01,667 --> 00:13:07,542
The teacher mentioned four are dead.
Should we trust that?

223
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:15,375
Kyouya, where are you and what are you doing?

224
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:26,208
Ohts is protesting?

225
00:13:26,208 --> 00:13:29,042
They want us to give up the taratect.

226
00:13:29,042 --> 00:13:31,375
They claimed these are all their rights.

227
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:36,333
What nonsense.
A wild monster doesn't belong to anyone.

228
00:13:36,333 --> 00:13:40,833
Father has been working very hard recently.

229
00:13:40,833 --> 00:13:45,417
The monster that lives in the forest
of our territory is to be blamed.

230
00:13:47,042 --> 00:13:49,250
Why did this happen?

231
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:54,792
The taratect, the Nightmare of the Labyrinth,
destroyed the fortress of Ohts.

232
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:58,417
They want it punished.

233
00:13:58,417 --> 00:14:00,833
What a troublesome fellow.

234
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:05,167
I wonder why it's known as the Mythical Beast.

235
00:14:05,167 --> 00:14:10,958
People of other countries keep coming
to negotiate with father.

236
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:15,250
Give it up to avoid risk or something like that.

237
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:17,500
How are you planning to reply?

238
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:23,500
To sincerely and euphemistically tell them
that it doesn't belong to us.

239
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,750
Master, the guest...

240
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:28,625
I'm not seeing any guest today. Send them away.

241
00:14:28,625 --> 00:14:31,833
It won't take long.

242
00:14:33,375 --> 00:14:36,833
I'm the clan leader of the elves.
My name is Potimas.

243
00:14:36,833 --> 00:14:39,875
Elf? This is my first time seeing one in person.

244
00:14:39,875 --> 00:14:41,667
The clan leader of the elves.

245
00:14:41,667 --> 00:14:44,417
Sorry for the sudden visit.

246
00:14:44,417 --> 00:14:48,208
It's okay. You came all the way to visit.

247
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:50,792
It's my pleasure.

248
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:54,208
May I know what you are here for?

249
00:14:54,208 --> 00:14:59,875
Nothing much. I just want to have a look
at this widely known Mythical Beast.

250
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:04,000
You have a very great Mythical Beast.

251
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,167
It's giving me a lot of trouble recently.

252
00:15:08,167 --> 00:15:10,625
That's unexpected.

253
00:15:10,625 --> 00:15:11,792
He's looking this way.

254
00:15:11,792 --> 00:15:15,458
Your daughter is so cute. What's her name?

255
00:15:15,458 --> 00:15:16,958
She's called Sophia.

256
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:18,333
Sophia.

257
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,125
I see.

258
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:30,708
That spider is a guardian Ariel sent you.
Not to be underestimated.

259
00:15:30,708 --> 00:15:36,000
What? Ariel? Is that a detergent or softener?

260
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:42,167
Ariel has noticed the existence
of the reincarnations. Is that right?

261
00:15:42,167 --> 00:15:43,458
Master Potimas.

262
00:15:44,625 --> 00:15:50,625
Excuse me. She's too cute. I can't wait
to see her appearance in the future.

263
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:53,917
What's wrong with that guy?
This doesn't feel good.

264
00:15:58,125 --> 00:16:00,375
WISDOM

265
00:16:01,958 --> 00:16:04,000
It's the Devil!

266
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,208
Oh no, she's coming my way! Oh no!

267
00:16:07,208 --> 00:16:09,958
This fellow is scary!

268
00:16:09,958 --> 00:16:11,417
Should I run?

269
00:16:12,208 --> 00:16:14,625
By the way, where is mother?

270
00:16:14,625 --> 00:16:17,375
"WISDOM"
She's at the Bottom Stratum of Great Elroe Labyrinth.

271
00:16:17,375 --> 00:16:20,417
"IDENTIFICATION"
Hello, mother. Are you feeling alright?

272
00:16:20,417 --> 00:16:22,292
QUEEN TARATECT. WEAKENING. LEVEL 89.
Her condition is horrible.

273
00:16:22,292 --> 00:16:24,542
Her ability values are averagely 6,000.

274
00:16:24,542 --> 00:16:28,667
They're about 70% worse than before.

275
00:16:28,667 --> 00:16:32,042
That's right.
Discount auction before closing begins now!

276
00:16:32,042 --> 00:16:34,583
Well done, parallel wills.

277
00:16:34,583 --> 00:16:35,125
Body!

278
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:38,708
Because of all your effort,
mother's ability values have reduced.

279
00:16:38,708 --> 00:16:40,125
Thank you!

280
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:44,042
In comparison,
I'm energetic now while Devil isn't around,

281
00:16:44,042 --> 00:16:47,083
here's the time to win!

282
00:16:47,083 --> 00:16:50,292
Let's go to the Bottom Stratum
of Great Elroe Labyrinth.

283
00:16:52,875 --> 00:16:54,875
I'm going to surpass you now.

284
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:59,500
No. I can't surpass you in size.
She looks huge in person.

285
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,625
What's with this feeling of oppression?

286
00:17:01,625 --> 00:17:05,542
Did she really become weaker? It's so scary.

287
00:17:06,208 --> 00:17:08,417
I can't hold back.

288
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:14,291
I'm twice as fast as mother.
It's more than enough... Weird.

289
00:17:14,291 --> 00:17:18,249
More than enough... Why can't I move?

290
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:20,333
Seriously?

291
00:17:20,333 --> 00:17:23,875
Mother's silks. A high level silk skill.

292
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:25,167
Is that a trap?

293
00:17:30,958 --> 00:17:32,958
Hold on a second.

294
00:17:32,958 --> 00:17:34,875
I want to heal my legs first.

295
00:17:34,875 --> 00:17:36,958
Wait for me.

296
00:17:41,958 --> 00:17:44,833
I'll be dead if I'm hit.

297
00:17:44,833 --> 00:17:46,417
Oh no. The silks!

298
00:17:47,125 --> 00:17:48,083
What?

299
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:52,250
Seriously? Did she spit silks everywhere?

300
00:17:53,958 --> 00:17:56,000
So strong.

301
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,708
What should I do? Teleport?

302
00:17:58,542 --> 00:18:02,292
I can't use magic in time. In this case...

303
00:18:07,875 --> 00:18:10,000
It appears. The head of the spider.

304
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,500
How about surrendering obediently?

305
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,542
"SO I'M A SPIDER, SO WHAT?"
Oh no. She's doing that again.

306
00:18:22,042 --> 00:18:24,250
A revolving lantern appeared.

307
00:18:25,375 --> 00:18:29,208
It's my fault to think I could defeat her
once she turns weak.

308
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:33,292
Even when mother's soul is being gnawed...
Even when it's desperate,

309
00:18:33,292 --> 00:18:35,625
she keeps fighting and never give up.

310
00:18:35,625 --> 00:18:39,042
I want to inherit the will power of my mother.

311
00:18:39,042 --> 00:18:40,458
I can't be defeated by her.

312
00:18:40,458 --> 00:18:46,625
At least I should let mother know that
I'm a strong enemy that fights until the end.

313
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:49,375
Okay. The last strike before death.

314
00:18:49,375 --> 00:18:50,917
This is the determination.

315
00:18:50,917 --> 00:18:52,333
What?

316
00:18:53,292 --> 00:18:55,833
The previous person in charge of magic,
long time no see.

317
00:18:55,833 --> 00:18:58,958
But even if you're back now,
you'll be killed like me.

318
00:18:58,958 --> 00:19:00,583
At least you should survive.

319
00:19:00,583 --> 00:19:02,917
I've received your encouragement.

320
00:19:05,917 --> 00:19:07,042
What happened?

321
00:19:07,042 --> 00:19:09,500
I feel like I'm full of power.

322
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:14,208
Where do you think mother's
missing ability values went to?

323
00:19:14,208 --> 00:19:15,417
I don't know.

324
00:19:15,417 --> 00:19:20,250
We ate mother's mental body.
Mental body is soul.

325
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:22,958
Ability values and skills
are the strength of souls.

326
00:19:22,958 --> 00:19:23,917
What does it mean?

327
00:19:23,917 --> 00:19:25,625
That means, mother's strength

328
00:19:25,625 --> 00:19:30,083
will be transferred to us
who eaten her soul, right?

329
00:19:30,083 --> 00:19:33,917
That means, the missing ability values of hers
is used to increase my ability?

330
00:19:33,917 --> 00:19:35,750
Correct!

331
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:36,958
Alright.

332
00:19:36,958 --> 00:19:38,958
Fight back!

333
00:19:46,208 --> 00:19:47,875
So awesome!

334
00:19:49,708 --> 00:19:51,917
The healing magic is fast as well.

335
00:19:51,917 --> 00:19:53,917
ZANA HOROWA. NAMELESS. LEVEL 24.

336
00:20:02,708 --> 00:20:04,917
What is this?

337
00:20:04,917 --> 00:20:08,583
This value is odd. I've became very strong.

338
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:12,833
Isn't this the privilege
of the protagonists of mangas?

339
00:20:13,625 --> 00:20:16,125
Just kill her first, then we will talk.

340
00:20:16,125 --> 00:20:21,083
Mother, you're great. Goodbye.

341
00:20:27,792 --> 00:20:30,292
Everyone, thank you. You're back!

342
00:20:30,292 --> 00:20:32,042
Let me tell you.

343
00:20:32,042 --> 00:20:33,375
What?

344
00:20:33,375 --> 00:20:36,167
The previous person in charge of body is gone.

345
00:20:36,167 --> 00:20:37,208
Where is she?

346
00:20:37,208 --> 00:20:38,542
At the Devil's.

347
00:20:38,542 --> 00:20:41,167
Devil? Why?

348
00:20:41,167 --> 00:20:44,583
When mother and Devil contacted,
the channel was opened.

349
00:20:44,583 --> 00:20:47,875
She went to attack Devil through that channel.

350
00:20:47,875 --> 00:20:49,417
Could she come back?

351
00:20:49,417 --> 00:20:52,250
Who knows? Maybe not.

352
00:20:52,917 --> 00:20:55,625
Because there's no connection
between Devil and I.

353
00:20:55,625 --> 00:20:57,250
That's right.

354
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:59,500
WISDOM

355
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:02,875
Oh no, Devil is coming this way.

356
00:21:02,875 --> 00:21:04,458
Retreat!

357
00:21:06,125 --> 00:21:08,167
Goodbye, the previous person in charge of body.

358
00:21:08,167 --> 00:21:09,250
Body.

359
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:11,250
I will never forget you.

360
00:21:15,958 --> 00:21:19,167
♫This is annoying. I'm sure I won♫

361
00:21:19,167 --> 00:21:22,458
♫Weak one (swallow it) Strong ones (Exhausted).
Take it as nutrition♫

362
00:21:22,458 --> 00:21:25,708
♫"Again! Again!" What a boring game♫

363
00:21:25,708 --> 00:21:29,125
♫Don't look down at life♫

364
00:21:29,125 --> 00:21:32,500
♫Fooled.
I knew your intelligence is wrong♫

365
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:35,833
♫Tell me how it feels
to be fooled by an inferior animal♫

366
00:21:35,833 --> 00:21:38,792
♫I'm still happy over your misery today.
I shall start eating now♫

367
00:21:38,792 --> 00:21:42,250
♫Unreasonable, unlucky, so what?♫

368
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:48,417
♫I want to try my best to live♫

369
00:21:48,417 --> 00:21:51,583
♫Succeeded. I almost got all of you♫

370
00:21:51,583 --> 00:21:54,625
♫Silk control. Venomous fangs.
Sure-win strategy. Watch it♫

371
00:21:54,625 --> 00:21:58,167
♫Victory! No one can stop me♫

372
00:21:58,167 --> 00:22:01,792
♫Despite the failed reincarnation,
I want to keep living♫

373
00:22:01,792 --> 00:22:04,792
♫Defeat! Great! Spider! Good!♫

374
00:22:04,792 --> 00:22:08,250
♫Defeat! No problem!
Spider's style! (Die, die die)♫

375
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:11,250
♫Defeat! Great! Spider! Good!♫

376
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:14,792
♫Defeat! No problem!
Spider's style! (Die, die die)♫

377
00:22:25,125 --> 00:22:27,042
Unforgivable.

378
00:22:27,042 --> 00:22:29,375
It seems to be a tough battle.

379
00:22:30,125 --> 00:22:36,333
What's the matter? You're being nosy.
That's a violation of the agreement.

380
00:22:36,333 --> 00:22:40,708
That's the agreement between my master and you.

381
00:22:40,708 --> 00:22:47,208
I have to obey to all the orders of my master.
He didn't say I can't have conflict with you.

382
00:22:47,208 --> 00:22:50,542
Sophistry. So what?

383
00:22:50,542 --> 00:22:53,708
Don't you think it's time to obsolete?

384
00:22:53,708 --> 00:22:55,625
What do you mean?

385
00:22:55,625 --> 00:22:58,250
A new trend is coming.

386
00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:03,875
As ancient mythical beasts,
it's about time for us to leave this world.

387
00:23:05,625 --> 00:23:09,292
There's a strong one who defeated our comrades.

388
00:23:09,292 --> 00:23:13,208
She isn't someone you can harm now.

389
00:23:13,208 --> 00:23:17,208
I have to say, my mood is horrible now.

390
00:23:17,208 --> 00:23:19,708
If you keep nagging, I'll make you disappear.

391
00:23:19,708 --> 00:23:23,125
A strong one is always respectable.

392
00:23:23,125 --> 00:23:25,125
I told you to shut up!

393
00:23:36,333 --> 00:23:39,000
SO I'M A SPIDER, SO WHAT?
NEXT EPISODE: IS IT, MY FAULT?

394
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,458
STAY TUNE
