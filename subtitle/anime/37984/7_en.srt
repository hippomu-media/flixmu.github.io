1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,500
THE RULER OF PATIENCE

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:06,333
The ruler of patience.

3
00:00:06,333 --> 00:00:08,458
Heretical Doctrine Invalidation obtained.

4
00:00:08,458 --> 00:00:12,208
Convicted...
Conditions fulfilled. Patience obtained.

5
00:00:12,208 --> 00:00:15,750
Effect, defence, resistance
and other abilities are upgraded.

6
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:18,000
The ban of Evil Eye skills is lifted.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,917
The title "The Ruler of Patience"

8
00:00:20,917 --> 00:00:24,083
sounds really astonishing.

9
00:00:24,083 --> 00:00:27,458
Humankind is tough and so on.

10
00:00:27,458 --> 00:00:31,625
But this is even more astonishing.

11
00:00:31,625 --> 00:00:33,917
"THE BAN ON EVIL EYE SKILLS IS LIFTED."
Evil eye skills.

12
00:00:35,583 --> 00:00:37,917
If the Evil Eye is obtained...

13
00:00:39,792 --> 00:00:42,708
My right eye hurts... and so on.

14
00:00:42,708 --> 00:00:46,375
It's not your time yet... and so on.

15
00:00:51,292 --> 00:00:53,958
This is the so-called killing.

16
00:00:53,958 --> 00:00:55,708
DELUSION

17
00:00:55,708 --> 00:00:57,708
Maybe I could say such things.

18
00:00:57,708 --> 00:01:02,167
I really can't stop being delusional.
The evil eyeballs.

19
00:01:02,167 --> 00:01:03,250
CURSED EVIL EYE. 100 POINT.
HURT OPPONENTS IN SIGHT WITH CURSES

00:01:03,917 --> 00:01:04,875
EXTINGUISHING EYE. 100 POINTS.

HYPNOTISING EVIL EYE. 100 POINTS.

28
00:01:12,583 --> 00:01:15,792
"FRIGHTENING EVIL EYE. 100 POINTS."
It's so hard to pick from one of these.

29
00:01:16,375 --> 00:01:18,167
The person in charge of information.

30
00:01:18,167 --> 00:01:20,667
What's the matter, the person in charge of body?

31
00:01:20,667 --> 00:01:22,750
Just choose a couple more.

32
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:24,000
What does it mean?

33
00:01:24,833 --> 00:01:27,458
I have eight eyes.

34
00:01:27,458 --> 00:01:31,833
That means I can activate
eight Evil Eyes at once.

35
00:01:33,542 --> 00:01:35,792
You're a genius!

36
00:01:35,792 --> 00:01:39,500
Activating eight Evil Eyes
at once sounds powerful.

37
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:42,000
Great! The dream becomes bigger.

38
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,125
Just choose one for now.

39
00:01:44,125 --> 00:01:46,417
The rest can be obtained later.

40
00:01:46,417 --> 00:01:48,125
Okay.

41
00:01:48,125 --> 00:01:50,250
Which Evil Eye would you like to choose?

42
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:51,708
The Cursed Evil Eye, of course.

43
00:01:51,708 --> 00:01:53,625
Evil Eye reminds me of curses.

44
00:01:53,625 --> 00:01:56,500
You're my clone indeed. You know me very well.

45
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:59,167
I want the Cursed Evil Eye, please.

46
00:01:59,167 --> 00:02:02,000
"CURSED EVIL EYE OBTAINED"
I got the Evil Eye!

47
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,333
Hooray!

48
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:07,542
I have to try the Evil Eye out.

49
00:02:07,542 --> 00:02:09,833
I hope there's a monster
that can be my experiment subject.

50
00:02:09,833 --> 00:02:11,833
Okay. Investigation skill activated.

51
00:02:11,833 --> 00:02:13,750
An evolved frog is detected.

52
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:15,375
ELROE GEAFROG. LEVEL FOUR.

53
00:02:15,375 --> 00:02:19,958
You're the first prey of my Evil Eye.
You should be proud of that.

54
00:02:19,958 --> 00:02:21,875
My right eye hurts a little.

55
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:24,583
Hold on. That was my line.

56
00:02:24,583 --> 00:02:27,250
Don't care. Charge!

57
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:29,708
Get rid of the taboo fate.

58
00:02:29,708 --> 00:02:31,917
Activate Evil Eye.

59
00:02:37,667 --> 00:02:41,250
The first level of invasion is rather slow.

60
00:02:50,958 --> 00:02:52,208
Is it dead?

61
00:02:54,125 --> 00:02:56,542
Proficiency achieved a certain target.

62
00:02:56,542 --> 00:03:00,708
Identification skill upgraded to level 10.

63
00:03:00,708 --> 00:03:02,250
Awesome! Finally!

64
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:04,083
My identification skill is at its highest level.

65
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:06,000
Oh my, I'm so happy.

66
00:03:10,333 --> 00:03:11,417
What?

67
00:03:11,417 --> 00:03:12,958
What's that rustling noise?

68
00:03:12,958 --> 00:03:14,667
The person in charge of information.

69
00:03:15,625 --> 00:03:18,083
What?

70
00:03:21,542 --> 00:03:22,708
Forget it.

71
00:03:22,708 --> 00:03:24,167
Isn't this great?

72
00:03:24,167 --> 00:03:28,208

SO I'M A SPIDER, SO WHAT?

97
00:04:55,708 --> 00:04:59,917
Teacher, other than us,
there should other reincarnations, right?

98
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,708
Of course.

99
00:05:02,708 --> 00:05:07,833
According to the wishes of the 11 people,
I placed them in different villages of Elroe.

100
00:05:07,833 --> 00:05:11,583
There were 26 people in the class including you.

101
00:05:11,583 --> 00:05:15,917
I, Kanata, Shinohara and Hasebe who's now Yuri.

102
00:05:15,917 --> 00:05:18,208
Natsume who's now Hugo.

103
00:05:18,208 --> 00:05:21,250
In addition to the 11 people
in the villages of Elroe,

104
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:22,833
there are 17 of us.

105
00:05:22,833 --> 00:05:27,750
There are two more people, who I will meet soon.

106
00:05:29,125 --> 00:05:32,792
That means we still don't know
where the other seven are.

107
00:05:35,875 --> 00:05:41,208
Although I didn't want to tell you,
four of them are dead.

108
00:05:42,583 --> 00:05:47,542
The other three are alive,
but they're in states which can't be helped.

109
00:05:47,542 --> 00:05:50,458
What are states that can't be helped?

110
00:05:50,458 --> 00:05:52,208
It's a secret.

111
00:05:53,958 --> 00:05:56,542
We're asking you seriously.

112
00:05:57,708 --> 00:06:01,333
I'm also keeping a secret seriously.

113
00:06:01,333 --> 00:06:02,500
I don't get what you mean.

114
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,375
Kana... Katia.

115
00:06:04,375 --> 00:06:05,917
To find so many students

116
00:06:05,917 --> 00:06:09,792
in such a huge world must be very tough.

117
00:06:10,958 --> 00:06:15,417
You're doing this for all of us.

118
00:06:16,417 --> 00:06:18,833
It's the duty of a teacher.

119
00:06:18,833 --> 00:06:21,542
Besides, most of the students
are in humans' area

120
00:06:21,542 --> 00:06:24,208
and were found as humans.

121
00:06:24,208 --> 00:06:27,083
It's not as tough as you said.

122
00:06:27,083 --> 00:06:30,792
There are very few exceptions like me.

123
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:34,833
You can't help the other three...

124
00:06:34,833 --> 00:06:36,875
It's a secret.

125
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:46,167
You will find out one day, but not today.

126
00:06:46,167 --> 00:06:47,458
I get it.

127
00:06:47,458 --> 00:06:49,125
By the way, let me give you an advice.

128
00:06:49,125 --> 00:06:50,458
Advice?

129
00:06:50,458 --> 00:06:52,875
Try not to practise any skill.

130
00:06:52,875 --> 00:06:54,333
Why?

131
00:06:54,333 --> 00:06:55,667
I can't tell.

132
00:06:55,667 --> 00:06:58,708
We were attacked by an earth dragon.

133
00:06:58,708 --> 00:07:02,083
Asking us not to practise
any skill in this world is...

134
00:07:02,083 --> 00:07:04,542
Skills are dangerous.

135
00:07:04,542 --> 00:07:07,750
Please believe in my words.

136
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:11,375
But Yuri told us to practise our skills nonstop.

137
00:07:11,375 --> 00:07:14,417
-That's a dangerous mindset.
-There wouldn't be monsters in that place.

138
00:07:14,417 --> 00:07:16,375
Let's go camping.

139
00:07:16,375 --> 00:07:18,917
You're Hugo indeed.

140
00:07:18,917 --> 00:07:21,458
Okay.
We should go for outdoor activities happily.

141
00:07:21,458 --> 00:07:22,708
Yes.

142
00:07:24,625 --> 00:07:28,208
You must have
a good relationship with your friends.

143
00:07:29,042 --> 00:07:30,917
Talk to Natsume.

144
00:07:30,917 --> 00:07:32,250
Brother.

145
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:34,000
You should have told me you went to the canteen.

146
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,875
Why didn't you tell me?

147
00:07:36,875 --> 00:07:38,917
Sorry. What's going on?

148
00:07:38,917 --> 00:07:42,542
Those who joined
the off-campus education should gather now.

149
00:07:42,542 --> 00:07:47,167
To all 12 of you
who decided to join the off-campus education,

150
00:07:47,167 --> 00:07:52,292
please split yourselves into groups
for the activities in the mountains.

151
00:07:52,292 --> 00:07:57,708
Experiencing the habitat
of the monsters is one of the goals.

152
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,833
Only low-level monsters inhabit this mountain.

153
00:08:03,833 --> 00:08:05,708
Don't worry.

154
00:08:07,375 --> 00:08:12,542
Another goal is to collect herbs
and to learn the knowledge of the mountains.

155
00:08:12,542 --> 00:08:14,625
Draw a lot to decide on your group.

156
00:08:17,625 --> 00:08:20,083
Brother, which group are you in?

157
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:24,833
No, don't be like that, Sue.

158
00:08:24,833 --> 00:08:28,333
Sue and I are in the same group.
Please guide me.

159
00:08:28,333 --> 00:08:30,958
I'm in the same group as you too.

160
00:08:30,958 --> 00:08:32,500
Shun, which group are you in?

161
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:35,082
I'm in the same group as Teacher Olisa.

162
00:08:35,082 --> 00:08:36,957
In the same group as Hugo?

163
00:08:40,875 --> 00:08:42,582
Please guide me.

164
00:08:42,582 --> 00:08:44,917
Mr. Schlain, it's my honour.

165
00:08:44,917 --> 00:08:46,375
Please guide me.

166
00:08:50,625 --> 00:08:56,750
Everyone, collect your own things
and start the activities. Dismiss.

167
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:01,667
Brother, goodbye for now.

168
00:09:01,667 --> 00:09:03,875
We are only apart for one day.
You're exaggerating it.

169
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:06,083
Even one day is a big matter.

170
00:09:06,083 --> 00:09:09,417
Whenever I think about you
being in danger which I can't see,

171
00:09:09,417 --> 00:09:10,917
I can't sleep at night.

172
00:09:10,917 --> 00:09:12,333
I will be fine.

173
00:09:12,333 --> 00:09:17,500
Sue, just have a good chat with me tonight.

174
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,833
Shun.

175
00:09:18,833 --> 00:09:21,917
Identify your teammates tonight.

176
00:09:21,917 --> 00:09:25,917
If you find someone
using forbidden skills, tell me.

177
00:09:25,917 --> 00:09:28,333
Okay. I will remember that.

178
00:09:29,792 --> 00:09:32,875
It's better that I don't use
the identification skill.

179
00:09:33,958 --> 00:09:38,375
You should use this chance
to fix your relationship with Natsume.

180
00:09:38,375 --> 00:09:41,333
We're all reincarnations.
We can't be hating each other forever.

181
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:42,750
Yes.

182
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,875
Is Fei angry?

183
00:09:48,875 --> 00:09:52,833
Companion monsters aren't allowed
to join off-campus educations?

184
00:09:52,833 --> 00:09:54,333
I think so.

185
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:59,667
After all, this activity is
to test the students' independence.

186
00:09:59,667 --> 00:10:01,417
But I'm surprised.

187
00:10:01,417 --> 00:10:02,958
Why?

188
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:05,208
You actually joined so obediently.

189
00:10:05,208 --> 00:10:10,667
I'm indeed a problematic student
who's always absent.

190
00:10:10,667 --> 00:10:13,667
Why are you always on leave?

191
00:10:13,667 --> 00:10:17,042
No matter how I ask,
you will say it's a secret, right?

192
00:10:17,042 --> 00:10:19,042
You're right.

193
00:10:19,042 --> 00:10:20,958
Is this the campsite?

194
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:23,333
It seems we're earlier than expected.

195
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:25,208
Let's start preparing.

196
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:26,917
Okay.

197
00:10:26,917 --> 00:10:30,000
A man's physical strength is indeed good.

198
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,750
As a girl, it's tiring for me to follow up.

199
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:36,833
Your ability value should be quite high.

200
00:10:36,833 --> 00:10:40,083
This can't be tough for you.

201
00:10:40,083 --> 00:10:44,583
Even if you know this,
you should pretend like you don't know.

202
00:10:44,583 --> 00:10:47,875
A good man should just greet me kindly.

203
00:10:47,875 --> 00:10:52,375
I don't want to be a henpecked man.

204
00:10:56,583 --> 00:11:00,250
Mr. Schlain, can you please hand it over to me?

205
00:11:05,333 --> 00:11:08,125
Okay, it's done.

206
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:09,125
Thank you.

207
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:12,792
No, I should thank you for your help.

208
00:11:12,792 --> 00:11:14,042
I'm sorry.

209
00:11:14,042 --> 00:11:17,875
Palton, status is irrelevant in school.

210
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:20,250
You don't have to be so polite to me.

211
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:23,500
I just respect you personally.

212
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:24,917
Personally?

213
00:11:24,917 --> 00:11:28,167
You defeated the earth dragon excellently.

214
00:11:28,833 --> 00:11:32,708
That's why I do this willingly.

215
00:11:35,167 --> 00:11:38,042
We set up the tent earlier than expected.

216
00:11:38,042 --> 00:11:40,958
Go explore on your own.

217
00:11:42,375 --> 00:11:45,792
But don't go too far away from the campsite.

218
00:11:45,792 --> 00:11:48,292
Get back here in an hour.

219
00:11:48,292 --> 00:11:49,417
Okay.

220
00:11:54,083 --> 00:11:55,042
ENUPS

221
00:11:55,042 --> 00:11:56,458
A LUSH VEGETATION IN DASTRUTIA.
CAN BE USED TO TREAT STUFFY NOSE.

222
00:11:57,167 --> 00:11:59,750
A herb that be used to treat stuffy nose.

223
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:07,833
Palton.

224
00:12:09,417 --> 00:12:11,708
Could something have been done on the sword

225
00:12:11,708 --> 00:12:13,458
or was a silencer skill used...

226
00:12:15,042 --> 00:12:16,167
Palton!

227
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:25,667
Hey.

228
00:12:25,667 --> 00:12:28,750
SO I'M A SPIDER, SO WHAT?

229
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:30,958
What did you do to Palton?

230
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:34,750
Forget about the small potato.

231
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,667
How can you say he's a small potato?

232
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:42,250
How annoying.

233
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:46,250
I wanted to get rid of you around here.

234
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:49,542
You're really in the way.

235
00:12:49,542 --> 00:12:53,333
This world exists for me to conquer it.

236
00:12:53,333 --> 00:12:54,917
But there's someone who's equal

237
00:12:54,917 --> 00:12:57,917
or even better than me.
Do you think I can be reconciled to this?

238
00:12:57,917 --> 00:13:01,042
What are you talking about? Are you serious?

239
00:13:01,042 --> 00:13:03,250
Of course, I'm serious.

240
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:08,167
This is a dream world, where you can
be anything as long as you have the skill.

241
00:13:08,167 --> 00:13:12,708
This world exists because of me.

242
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:17,458
But I don't need a person like you.

243
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,958
So, die.

244
00:13:24,542 --> 00:13:27,500
HUGO BAINT RENXANDT. LEVEL 31.

245
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:30,917
What's wrong? Are you shivering?

246
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,333
So powerful.

247
00:13:39,333 --> 00:13:42,417
Besides, he's working
very hard on obtaining skills.

248
00:13:43,208 --> 00:13:45,208
The trickiest part of all...

249
00:13:45,208 --> 00:13:47,000
is The Skill of The Emperor.

250
00:13:48,125 --> 00:13:51,500
I can resist the fear
under the pressure of authority.

251
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:54,333
But the fact that
it can improve skills is horrifying.

252
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:55,417
Watch this.

253
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:58,792
I know.

254
00:13:58,792 --> 00:14:02,375
You hardly use skill points, right?

255
00:14:03,042 --> 00:14:05,042
You aren't upgrading your level either.

256
00:14:05,042 --> 00:14:08,792
Points are meant to be used.

257
00:14:08,792 --> 00:14:10,458
Like this.

258
00:14:11,542 --> 00:14:13,375
Just give up.

259
00:14:14,375 --> 00:14:17,958
Do you think you can get out of this
after doing such things?

260
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:22,208
Haven't I told you? I'm the future king.

261
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:25,417
I can do whatever I want.

262
00:14:27,625 --> 00:14:29,542
King?

263
00:14:31,083 --> 00:14:33,875
I've planned beforehand.

264
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:37,583
My subordinates are dealing with the rest.

265
00:14:37,583 --> 00:14:39,292
After dealing with you,

266
00:14:39,292 --> 00:14:41,750
I will release the monsters I brought along.

267
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:43,083
Monsters?

268
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:46,833
Those are powerful monsters
that won't appear here.

269
00:14:46,833 --> 00:14:49,708
Poor Prince Shun, Teacher Olisa,

270
00:14:49,708 --> 00:14:55,375
and other students will be eaten by monsters.
Just like this.

271
00:14:55,375 --> 00:14:57,333
Next, I will beat the monsters

272
00:14:57,333 --> 00:15:01,500
for the justice of my comrades.
Then I shall go back alive.

273
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:05,125
Your horrible plan is going to be reported.

274
00:15:05,125 --> 00:15:07,667
Who's going to report on me?

275
00:15:07,667 --> 00:15:10,000
This isn't Japan.

276
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,333
Even if something is strange,
who would bring it up?

277
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:19,667
After committing a crime,
it won't be told to the world.

278
00:15:19,667 --> 00:15:22,708
You're abnormal.

279
00:15:22,708 --> 00:15:29,750
You're abnormal for obeying
the common sense of the previous world here.

280
00:15:31,792 --> 00:15:35,250
What a weak sword.

281
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:37,375
It's ridiculously weak.

282
00:15:39,917 --> 00:15:43,333
Where is the heroic gesture
when you defeated the earth dragon?

283
00:15:43,333 --> 00:15:45,125
Your Highness.

284
00:15:48,583 --> 00:15:51,875
I'm stronger after all.

285
00:15:51,875 --> 00:15:56,375
You were just lucky
when you defeated the earth dragon.

286
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:00,958
Goodbye forever.

287
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:05,792
I will remember you.

288
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:15,000
Natsume, you have gone too far.

289
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,500
It's you... Oka...

290
00:16:18,792 --> 00:16:22,167
All your subordinates have been caught.

291
00:16:22,167 --> 00:16:25,042
The monsters you brought along
have been destroyed too.

292
00:16:25,042 --> 00:16:26,875
What?

293
00:16:26,875 --> 00:16:31,250
I can't allow you to be
so out of control anymore.

294
00:16:40,292 --> 00:16:42,667
Is that the Magic of Wind?

295
00:16:43,708 --> 00:16:45,000
Let me go.

296
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,917
Activate ruler's power limitation.

297
00:16:46,917 --> 00:16:48,708
According to the ruler's request,

298
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:51,083
the special skill
of the ruler shall be activated.

299
00:16:51,083 --> 00:16:52,917
Do you agree?

300
00:16:55,125 --> 00:16:56,833
I agree.

301
00:16:58,083 --> 00:17:01,875
His ability values are decreasing.

302
00:17:01,875 --> 00:17:03,292
Even his skills are...

303
00:17:03,292 --> 00:17:06,041
What did you do to me?

304
00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:09,541
I reduced your ability values
and confiscated your skills.

305
00:17:09,541 --> 00:17:10,082
What?

306
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:12,208
Shun, how's the identification result?

307
00:17:12,208 --> 00:17:14,333
All ability values are at 30.

308
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:16,667
(n%I=W)
His skills are gone.

309
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,833
The world doesn't belong to you.

310
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:23,125
Reflect on yourself.

311
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:27,208
Besides, I suggest you
to live on as a normal person.

312
00:17:27,208 --> 00:17:30,958
My...

313
00:17:30,958 --> 00:17:32,208
Shun.

314
00:17:32,208 --> 00:17:35,667
Go help Teacher Olisa
and Palton with their injuries.

315
00:17:35,667 --> 00:17:36,917
Yes, the two of them...

316
00:17:36,917 --> 00:17:39,875
It's okay. They sustain only light injuries.

317
00:17:39,875 --> 00:17:43,917
After treatment, send them
to the hut at the bottom of the mountain.

318
00:17:43,917 --> 00:17:46,375
The off-campus education has ended.

319
00:17:47,792 --> 00:17:51,792
Did you really confiscate Hugo's skills?

320
00:17:51,792 --> 00:17:53,292
Haven't I told you?

321
00:17:53,292 --> 00:17:55,625
Skills are dangerous.

322
00:18:11,167 --> 00:18:13,458
Proficiency achieved a certain target.

323
00:18:13,458 --> 00:18:17,250
Visual enhancement upgraded to level 10.

324
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:19,125
Conditions fulfilled.

325
00:18:19,125 --> 00:18:22,333
Since visual enhancement
is upgraded to level 10,

326
00:18:22,333 --> 00:18:22,958
Great!

327
00:18:22,958 --> 00:18:25,417
-telescopic sight is derived.
-Visual enhancement is at its highest level now.

328
00:18:25,417 --> 00:18:29,208
Besides, because of the highest level,
a new skill is derived as a reward.

329
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:32,667
"TELESCOPIC SIGHT: ZOOM IN TO SEE DISTANT SCENERY."
It's so clear.

330
00:18:32,667 --> 00:18:36,042
It's a little ambiguous and unremarkable,

331
00:18:36,042 --> 00:18:38,208
but I should just activate it first.

332
00:18:38,208 --> 00:18:39,833
Come on. Activate!

333
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:45,000
This is awesome!

334
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,875
Sorry for saying you're unremarkable.

335
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:49,875
Two fields of view appear at the same time.

336
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:51,375
I'm confused.

337
00:18:51,375 --> 00:18:52,542
I'm just kidding.

338
00:18:52,542 --> 00:18:55,500
I have a clone now.

339
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:58,542
It can be divided into two sides.

340
00:18:58,542 --> 00:19:02,500
The Sickle of Death is upgraded
from level two to three.

341
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:06,833
Vision field expansion
is upgraded to level three.

342
00:19:06,833 --> 00:19:10,750
Life is upgraded to level 10.

343
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:12,708
Conditions fulfilled.

344
00:19:12,708 --> 00:19:18,208
Level-10 Life is upgraded
to level-one Bodily Life.

345
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:20,583
The person in charge of body...

346
00:19:20,583 --> 00:19:23,125
What, the person in charge of information?

347
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:26,167
Can I add the telescopic view to the Evil Eye?

348
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:30,083
You're a genius.

349
00:19:30,083 --> 00:19:33,083
A genius can do anything, right?

350
00:19:33,083 --> 00:19:37,083
If I can use the Evil Eye from a distance,
it must be awesome.

351
00:19:37,083 --> 00:19:39,708
Great! The dream becomes bigger.

352
00:19:39,708 --> 00:19:43,542
If I decided to do that,
I must find a prey for an experiment.

353
00:19:43,542 --> 00:19:45,042
Investigate!

354
00:19:45,042 --> 00:19:47,417
Proficiency achieved a certain target.

355
00:19:47,417 --> 00:19:49,792
Investigation skill is upgraded to level 10.

356
00:19:49,792 --> 00:19:50,625
What?

357
00:19:50,625 --> 00:19:52,750
Even the investigation skill
is upgraded to the highest level.

358
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:55,583
I'm on the path to be the strongest.

359
00:19:55,583 --> 00:20:01,083
But wouldn't another skill
be derived from the investigation skill?

360
00:20:01,083 --> 00:20:06,917
So the identification skill doesn't evolve
nor has any derivative skills.

361
00:20:07,917 --> 00:20:10,208
No, it's okay.

362
00:20:10,208 --> 00:20:13,167
It's great enough to train
until the highest level.

363
00:20:13,167 --> 00:20:20,917
I thought a wise man would appear.

364
00:20:20,917 --> 00:20:24,333
But the end result is very disappointing.

365
00:20:27,583 --> 00:20:30,750
What? It's the rustling noise again.

366
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:34,083
Hey, what's that?

367
00:20:35,917 --> 00:20:37,250
What?

368
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:39,208
I think I hear a tinkle.

369
00:20:39,208 --> 00:20:41,583
It's surely not the rustling noise.

370
00:20:41,583 --> 00:20:45,167
Your request has been accepted by Admin D.

371
00:20:45,167 --> 00:20:46,417
Who's D?

372
00:20:46,417 --> 00:20:49,000
The skill, Wisdom, is being created.

373
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,167
Creation complete.

374
00:20:51,167 --> 00:20:52,958
Conditions fulfilled.

375
00:20:52,958 --> 00:20:55,750
Wisdom obtained.

376
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:56,875
-Identification skill and Wisdom are combined.
-What?

377
00:20:56,875 --> 00:20:58,292
-Identification skill and wisdom are combined.
-No, that's odd.

378
00:20:58,292 --> 00:21:00,250
-Proficiency achieved a certain target.
-This is just too odd.

379
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:01,125
-Forbidden skill is upgraded
What's going on?

380
00:21:01,125 --> 00:21:02,250
-from level seven to eight.
-How did this happen?

381
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:03,292
-Condition fulfilled.
-What should I do?

382
00:21:03,292 --> 00:21:06,500
-The title, The Ruler of Wisdom, is obtained.
-Calm down. Take a deep breath.

383
00:21:13,417 --> 00:21:16,833
This is obviously an abnormal situation.

384
00:21:16,833 --> 00:21:18,375
Abnormal...

385
00:21:18,375 --> 00:21:20,583
Right, abnormal.

386
00:21:20,583 --> 00:21:25,292
I thought I was obtaining skills
according to the rules of this world.

387
00:21:25,292 --> 00:21:27,625
I thought I was following the stream.

388
00:21:27,625 --> 00:21:31,000
Just like the life in a game.

389
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,167
Because it's odd to have weird things

390
00:21:33,167 --> 00:21:37,042
like skills and ability values in real life.

391
00:21:37,042 --> 00:21:41,542
Your request has been accepted by Admin D.

392
00:21:41,542 --> 00:21:46,333
This sounds like someone is watching me,

393
00:21:46,333 --> 00:21:50,250
someone is creating skills
that match my complaints.

394
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:52,083
If that's really the case,

395
00:21:52,083 --> 00:21:54,583
someone who's managing may be around.

396
00:21:54,583 --> 00:21:58,167
If someone is watching
the development of this world,

397
00:21:58,167 --> 00:22:01,583
isn't this person like God?

398
00:22:01,583 --> 00:22:04,833
Then this is not a game world,

399
00:22:04,833 --> 00:22:09,583
but a game, which is managed by an admin.

400
00:22:11,833 --> 00:22:16,667
That means I'm just one of the characters.

401
00:22:17,625 --> 00:22:21,750
Am I considered as alive?

402
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:23,458
This is scary.

403
00:22:24,833 --> 00:22:28,667
What should I do from now on?

404
00:22:28,667 --> 00:22:30,625
What should I do?

405
00:22:35,083 --> 00:22:36,917
What a joke.

406
00:22:36,917 --> 00:22:39,500
What does it mean I've gone too far?

407
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:44,750
I must get my revenge on that evil elf.

408
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:50,125
I want to destroy everything you cherish.

409
00:22:50,125 --> 00:22:53,458
This world belongs to me.

410
00:22:56,292 --> 00:22:58,625
Let me give you a hand.

411
00:23:02,583 --> 00:23:04,958
Who are you?

412
00:23:04,958 --> 00:23:07,708
Because you're a reincarnation,

413
00:23:07,708 --> 00:23:10,792
I'm willing to help you.

414
00:23:10,792 --> 00:23:14,167
What reincarnation are you talking about?

415
00:23:19,833 --> 00:23:21,708
Forget it.

416
00:23:21,708 --> 00:23:25,542
It doesn't matter who you are.

417
00:23:25,542 --> 00:23:28,208
As long as I can get my revenge,

418
00:23:28,208 --> 00:23:31,833
I don't care if you're a devil or a human.

419
00:23:31,833 --> 00:23:36,333
Okay. I shall accept your offer.

420
00:23:36,333 --> 00:23:39,000
SO I'M A SPIDER, SO WHAT?
NEXT EPISODE: I WILL DIE

421
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,458
STAY TUNED
