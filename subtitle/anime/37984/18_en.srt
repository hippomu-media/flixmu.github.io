1
00:00:38,125 --> 00:00:43,167
I worked very hard to recover my head.
My level is back to its original state.

2
00:00:43,167 --> 00:00:46,000
It's awesome to have a body.

3
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:49,458
Alright. I feel like I've floated very far away.

4
00:00:49,458 --> 00:00:51,625
Where is this?

5
00:00:51,625 --> 00:00:53,458
Clairvoyance.

6
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,000
It's a town.

7
00:00:57,792 --> 00:01:01,500
I wonder if I can get any food in the town.

8
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:04,333
I don't think so. I'm a spider after all.

9
00:01:06,208 --> 00:01:07,667
That is...

10
00:01:10,042 --> 00:01:12,583
The thing the vampire child was in.

11
00:01:16,625 --> 00:01:20,125
Many people are still targeting the child.

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,167
♫The alarm goes off. My name is Little Spider♫

34
00:03:00,208 --> 00:03:05,042
We're finally back safely.
I didn't know what to do out of a sudden.

35
00:03:05,875 --> 00:03:08,083
I didn't expect to be rescued by a monster.

36
00:03:08,083 --> 00:03:12,542
That must have been
the Mythical Beast sent by the Goddess.

37
00:03:12,542 --> 00:03:17,208
It was sent by the Goddess to protect us.

38
00:03:17,208 --> 00:03:20,167
The Mythical Beast?

39
00:03:20,167 --> 00:03:24,542
-Master, should we look into this spider?
-Hey, Sophia. You must be tired.

40
00:03:24,542 --> 00:03:26,833
-Although we just got back, please do it.
-Sleep.

41
00:03:26,833 --> 00:03:28,667
I get it.

42
00:03:28,667 --> 00:03:31,167
Let me know if you find out anything.

43
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,208
Master, she's born.

44
00:04:02,042 --> 00:04:06,417
My name is Negishi Shouko.
I'm born and raised in Japan.

45
00:04:06,417 --> 00:04:11,333
But when I regain consciousness,
I became a baby somewhere. Not in Japan.

46
00:04:11,333 --> 00:04:13,375
A healthy baby girl.

47
00:04:14,875 --> 00:04:17,333
So cute.

48
00:04:17,333 --> 00:04:18,958
Listen.

49
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:21,667
Grow up to be a beauty like your mother.

50
00:04:22,208 --> 00:04:25,708
-Be as smart as daddy, okay?
-I didn't understand it at the beginning.

51
00:04:25,708 --> 00:04:29,792
But I seems to have been reincarnated
as the daughter of a noble family.

52
00:04:30,917 --> 00:04:34,833
I don't know how this happened.

53
00:04:34,833 --> 00:04:39,958
The last thing I remember
was being in a literature class.

54
00:04:39,958 --> 00:04:42,833
Although I felt confused and uneasy at first,

55
00:04:42,833 --> 00:04:47,375
the life with my gentle parents
and butler is better than the previous one.

56
00:04:47,375 --> 00:04:49,208
I got used to it quickly.

57
00:04:49,208 --> 00:04:54,500
I thought I could keep living
so freely and happily.

58
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,417
Until that day...

59
00:04:58,292 --> 00:05:03,000
Sophia, we're almost home.

60
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,125
Sophia is my new name in this world.

61
00:05:07,125 --> 00:05:11,583
I don't understand the imposing matter of Ohts.

62
00:05:11,583 --> 00:05:15,250
The power difference
of their country and ours is obvious.

63
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:20,667
Perhaps it's related to the allies,
Renxandt Empire and Holy Kingdom of Alleius.

64
00:05:20,667 --> 00:05:24,833
With the support of that two countries,
it's understandable that they show such manners.

65
00:05:24,833 --> 00:05:31,542
I heard The Religion of God Words
caused the conflict between Ohts and Sariella.

66
00:05:31,542 --> 00:05:37,125
Because they think Goddess Religion is a cult.
There's no wonder.

67
00:05:37,125 --> 00:05:39,708
I don't know about religions.

68
00:05:39,708 --> 00:05:45,792
According to them, The Religion of God Words
has been hostile to us unilaterally.

69
00:05:45,792 --> 00:05:48,083
But isn't the doctrine of
The Religion of God Words.

70
00:05:48,083 --> 00:05:52,000
"If you want to hear the sound of God,
upgrade your level."?

71
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,500
Isn't it the same sound as
the sound system that says "level upgrade"?

72
00:05:56,500 --> 00:06:00,292
It doesn't sound right to believe in that voice.

73
00:06:04,208 --> 00:06:06,917
Master, please wait in the cart.

74
00:06:12,958 --> 00:06:14,625
Kill them!

75
00:06:25,958 --> 00:06:27,750
What?

76
00:06:30,375 --> 00:06:31,917
Spider?

77
00:06:31,917 --> 00:06:33,500
Mon...ster.

78
00:06:35,583 --> 00:06:37,458
Run!

79
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:44,000
There's such a monster in this world.

80
00:06:44,958 --> 00:06:47,417
Outside is scary.

81
00:06:47,417 --> 00:06:53,208
It wouldn't come into the town,
so we won't meet again.

82
00:06:58,708 --> 00:07:01,083
What's the matter?

83
00:07:01,083 --> 00:07:02,875
Master.

84
00:07:02,875 --> 00:07:03,833
What's going on?

85
00:07:03,833 --> 00:07:08,667
The taratect seems to
have built a nest in the forest.

86
00:07:08,667 --> 00:07:10,375
What are you talking about?

87
00:07:15,208 --> 00:07:17,500
Let's say goodbye here.

88
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,167
Thank you for your care.

89
00:07:20,708 --> 00:07:24,708
Can I really take away all the material
of the earth dragon?

90
00:07:24,708 --> 00:07:26,792
All these can be sold for great money.

91
00:07:26,792 --> 00:07:30,792
This journey was rushy.
Please take this as a thank you gift from us.

92
00:07:31,833 --> 00:07:34,417
I shall take it then.

93
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:40,750
Well, Mr. Basgath.
Could you please keep being with us...

94
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:44,792
Young man, I'm just a wee guide.

95
00:07:46,542 --> 00:07:50,333
Bringing you all the way here is my duty.

96
00:07:50,333 --> 00:07:53,667
From now on, you have to count on yourselves.

97
00:07:53,667 --> 00:07:56,917
I can't be of any good use.

98
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:02,875
I will pray for this world to be better.

99
00:08:07,083 --> 00:08:09,625
I will try my best.

100
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:15,250
Can we go into Elf Village directly?

101
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:18,792
We are passing by Sariella
before entering the village.

102
00:08:18,792 --> 00:08:23,042
Therefore we should buy Fei
a cloak before entering the village.

103
00:08:23,042 --> 00:08:26,875
Right. Fei's wings are too eye-catching.

104
00:08:26,875 --> 00:08:28,750
That's one of the reasons.

105
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:32,750
But the main problem is,

106
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:36,207
Sariella believes in Goddess Religion.

107
00:08:36,207 --> 00:08:39,874
It's said that Goddess has white wings.

108
00:08:39,875 --> 00:08:43,042
That means if they see Fei's wings,
they may worship her?

109
00:08:43,042 --> 00:08:44,917
That would have been better.

110
00:08:44,917 --> 00:08:49,708
But they may attack her
for imitating the Goddess as blasphemy.

111
00:08:51,333 --> 00:08:56,000
In other words, it's a country where nothing is
strange depending on their way of thought.

112
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,292
The doctrine of Goddess Religion is, "Only those
who present skills to the Goddess can be saved".

113
00:09:00,292 --> 00:09:05,333
But the other one believes, "If you want to
hear the sound of God, upgrade your level."

114
00:09:05,333 --> 00:09:06,833
Present skills?

115
00:09:06,833 --> 00:09:09,083
It's said they have
the skill of "skill removal".

116
00:09:09,083 --> 00:09:14,333
They seem to think by removing their skills,
they're presented to the Goddess.

117
00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:20,667
Just like we who have memory of previous
life think having skills are unbelievable?

118
00:09:20,667 --> 00:09:22,167
Both sides are suspicious.

119
00:09:22,167 --> 00:09:27,667
Yes. Goddess Religion and The Religion
of God Words are hostile to each other.

120
00:09:27,667 --> 00:09:30,750
They were even in wars.

121
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:37,542
Shun isn't a believer of God Words,
but Warriors have been manged by this religion.

122
00:09:37,542 --> 00:09:42,667
That means if my identity as the Warrior
is exposed, we will be drawn into conflicts?

123
00:09:42,667 --> 00:09:45,333
It's best not to draw attention.

124
00:09:45,333 --> 00:09:46,833
That's right.

125
00:09:49,667 --> 00:09:52,500
Isn't there a cuter one?

126
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,750
Pink or with polka-dots?

127
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:56,458
You shouldn't draw attention.

128
00:09:56,458 --> 00:09:58,542
I know.

129
00:09:58,542 --> 00:10:04,250
Present your skills to be saved.

130
00:10:05,667 --> 00:10:10,750
Although God Words are controlled by Hugo,
Goddess Religion can't be trusted either.

131
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:16,417
I'm afraid the pontiff of God Words, Dustin,
is controlled by Hugo by now.

132
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:19,417
The pontiff?

133
00:10:21,125 --> 00:10:24,458
Have you met the pontiff?

134
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:26,875
-Yes...
-Child, are you alright?

135
00:10:26,875 --> 00:10:30,625
Good. Don't cry. You're a good boy.

136
00:10:35,083 --> 00:10:39,625
May God bless you.

137
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:46,667
He seems like a kind person.

138
00:10:47,958 --> 00:10:54,250
If he's also brainwashed and made used of,
I must save him.

139
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:58,250
Yes. In order to save him, we have to hurry.

140
00:11:03,208 --> 00:11:08,167
Goddess Religion and
The Religion of God Words are both unreliable.

141
00:11:08,792 --> 00:11:12,500
We have to defeat Hugo with our own power.

142
00:11:13,125 --> 00:11:16,625
The latest Warrior, Hugo Baint Renxandt,

143
00:11:16,625 --> 00:11:19,917
is sending troops to fight the evil elves.

144
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,625
Just have Hugo fight for us.

145
00:12:18,417 --> 00:12:22,333
The latest skill is called
Clairvoyance Cursed Evil Eye.

146
00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:26,167
Striking an unavoidable
deadly hit from a distance.

147
00:12:26,167 --> 00:12:28,958
A power that even I'm afraid of.

148
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:34,417
If dead bodies are found at home,
it means I've been targeted.

149
00:12:34,417 --> 00:12:39,125
Saved and immediately killed again.
What an unworthy loss.

150
00:12:40,583 --> 00:12:46,250
Let's have a look at the marked person.
He must be back in his base now.

151
00:12:54,458 --> 00:12:57,125
Is that an elf? Yes, it is.

152
00:12:57,125 --> 00:12:59,500
He seems to be talking about something.

153
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:07,958
He's talking to himself. No, it's telepathy.

154
00:13:07,958 --> 00:13:11,458
But I didn't expect the elves to be ruffians.

155
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:17,792
The elves always give the impression
of a nature-loving and upright race.

156
00:13:17,792 --> 00:13:22,000
These elves are far from being upright.

157
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:27,625
The robbers who attacked the vampire child
seem to be the elves' accomplices.

158
00:13:27,625 --> 00:13:29,500
Why are they targeting her?

159
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:37,083
They're surely getting some benefit out of this.
The experience of humans is delicious.

160
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:39,667
I shall protect them then.

161
00:13:39,667 --> 00:13:44,625
I don't know why Devil is at
the Bottom Stratum of Great Elroe Labyrinth.

162
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:48,750
From there to here,
even the Devil may take a few days.

163
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:52,625
I think it's fine to rest here for awhile.

164
00:13:54,292 --> 00:13:58,083
I shall just stay here tonight. Good night.

165
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:01,375
Failed?

166
00:14:01,375 --> 00:14:02,375
Yes.

167
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:04,042
What's the reason?

168
00:14:04,042 --> 00:14:07,542
Obstructed by a taratect both times.

169
00:14:07,542 --> 00:14:10,375
This is no coincidence.

170
00:14:10,375 --> 00:14:13,750
What should we do from now on?

171
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:16,417
I shall go myself.

172
00:14:16,417 --> 00:14:18,458
Master Potimas, you want to do it yourself?

173
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:24,125
Keep monitoring the spider.
Report to me when there's any action.

174
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:30,583
A taratect... could it be one of Ariel?

175
00:14:30,583 --> 00:14:35,000
I should be the only one
who knows the existence of the reincarnations.

176
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:40,750
Besides Ariel, that man might have noticed too.

177
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:44,833
Although I keep trying to hide it from him,

178
00:14:44,833 --> 00:14:50,833
the location is bad. Keren County
happens to be at the center of his plan.

179
00:14:50,833 --> 00:14:54,542
I don't know if Dustin is aware of
the existence of the reincarnations.

180
00:14:54,542 --> 00:14:58,667
But if we keep acting boldly,
we will surely be targeted by him.

181
00:14:59,292 --> 00:15:03,458
The worst case scenario is having
to fight Ariel and Dustin at the same time.

182
00:15:03,458 --> 00:15:08,042
Ariel has powerful strength
while Dustin has the power of masses.

183
00:15:08,042 --> 00:15:10,500
It's tricky no matter which side we fight.

184
00:15:11,542 --> 00:15:18,000
But these are good chances.
I shall defeat them myself.

185
00:15:22,375 --> 00:15:23,250
Open eyes.

186
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:25,792
Okay. Let's cheer up today!

187
00:15:25,792 --> 00:15:29,375
Let's hunt the robbers!

188
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:37,625
Ritual? Are they praying?
I want to hunt them anyway.

189
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:44,708
Very good.
Maintain this spirit and keep killing.

190
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:47,500
They are praying again.

191
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,542
However, no matter how you pray,

192
00:15:49,542 --> 00:15:53,208
you can't deny the fact of genocide, robbers.

193
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:05,042
Are the robbers in this world as such? Or are
they a syndicate that pretends to be robbers?

194
00:16:05,042 --> 00:16:07,500
Even elves are becoming robbers.

195
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:12,042
Perhaps I've been in involved
in some unknown conspiracies.

196
00:16:12,042 --> 00:16:15,250
Follow the spies who pretend to be robbers.

197
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:16,542
I'm just kidding.

198
00:16:18,125 --> 00:16:22,292
The entire espionage department is annihilated?

199
00:16:22,292 --> 00:16:23,125
Yes.

200
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:29,000
Since the cross-dressed spies are not killed,
I think they're targeting the robbers.

201
00:16:30,167 --> 00:16:33,750
An unexpected obstruction showing up halfway.

202
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:39,167
I didn't expect the Nightmare of Labyrinth
to reside in Sariella now.

203
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:42,917
It's a monster supported by Master Ariel.

204
00:16:42,917 --> 00:16:46,750
Is she telling us to stop attacking Sariella?

205
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:51,375
No matter what, we shall just
be alert and keep observing.

206
00:16:51,375 --> 00:16:55,500
Besides, Master Ariel isn't
the only one we should guard against.

207
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:59,208
Did you find out where the robbers are from?

208
00:16:59,208 --> 00:17:04,500
They seem to be from
an international human trafficking organisation.

209
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:09,416
We also found out that
there are elves in the organisation.

210
00:17:09,416 --> 00:17:15,332
Cursed Potimas.
What he does is a disaster to the world.

211
00:17:15,333 --> 00:17:16,958
The report isn't complete yet.

212
00:17:16,958 --> 00:17:21,583
There are elves in Keren County.
Should we take care of them?

213
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:25,416
We still don't know
Potimas' intention in Keren County

214
00:17:25,416 --> 00:17:29,375
and of the human trafficking.

215
00:17:29,375 --> 00:17:32,750
Why did he kidnap so many children?

216
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:34,500
No. Is this the opposite?

217
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:39,500
Are they trying to use this as cover
for that one child they're aiming for?

218
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:42,083
There's too few information.

219
00:17:42,083 --> 00:17:43,500
Master Dustin.

220
00:17:44,458 --> 00:17:46,542
No, let them live for now.

221
00:17:46,542 --> 00:17:49,208
The urgent task now is
to defeat Goddess Religion.

222
00:17:49,208 --> 00:17:50,417
Roger.

223
00:17:50,417 --> 00:17:55,208
Keep monitoring. Assume the war has started.

224
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:56,917
I understand.

225
00:17:58,375 --> 00:18:02,875
It will be most fortunate if Master Ariel
and Potimas both suffer great losses.

226
00:18:02,875 --> 00:18:10,292
The leader of Keren County tried hard to avoid
wars but he's getting more and more warlike now.

227
00:18:10,292 --> 00:18:13,542
He doesn't know it was us who induced it.

228
00:18:13,542 --> 00:18:19,958
Goddess Religion hates us
and we see them as a cult.

229
00:18:19,958 --> 00:18:25,125
But both of us believe in the same God.
This is ridiculous.

230
00:18:25,125 --> 00:18:27,708
What's going on?

231
00:18:27,708 --> 00:18:33,958
There were more robbers who came to kidnap,
but they're missing now.

232
00:18:33,958 --> 00:18:36,375
Did the taratect kill them?

233
00:18:36,375 --> 00:18:38,208
I'm afraid, yes.

234
00:18:38,208 --> 00:18:42,375
My wife is preaching everywhere
in town that the monster is a Mythical Beast.

235
00:18:42,375 --> 00:18:46,917
The folks are starting to believe
that it's the Mythical Beast.

236
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:49,458
They don't know how worried I am.

237
00:18:49,458 --> 00:18:51,417
Although it's known as the Mythical Beast,

238
00:18:51,417 --> 00:18:55,458
it's still a monster came out
from Great Elroe Labyrinth.

239
00:18:55,458 --> 00:18:59,667
Ohts calls it the Nightmare of Labyrinth.
Everyone is afraid of it.

240
00:18:59,667 --> 00:19:03,958
I heard the fortress of Ohts
was destroyed in a second.

241
00:19:03,958 --> 00:19:06,500
The danger level is as high as S.

242
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:12,667
But since it only attacks the robbers,
perhaps it has high intelligence,

243
00:19:12,667 --> 00:19:16,042
can understand human language
or even communicate.

244
00:19:16,042 --> 00:19:20,083
Even if it has high intelligence,
it doesn't mean it can communicate.

245
00:19:20,083 --> 00:19:24,583
Can you communicate normally with
the people of The Religion of God Words?

246
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:28,917
What do you think about the Nightmare?

247
00:19:28,917 --> 00:19:32,583
Regarding this, I don't know.

248
00:19:32,583 --> 00:19:37,583
I think it's hard to be understood.
It's evil but it helps the weak.

249
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:42,958
Evil but helps the weak.
It's getting more and more confusing.

250
00:19:43,458 --> 00:19:44,708
Oh no.

251
00:19:44,708 --> 00:19:46,667
What's going on? What's with the noise?

252
00:19:46,667 --> 00:19:49,500
Nightmare saved a heavily-sick patient.

253
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:53,125
What's with the spider?

254
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:57,500
Seems like the robbers
in this area are all dead.

255
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:03,708
The leader seems to think I'm a danger.
I'm a monster after all.

256
00:20:03,708 --> 00:20:08,042
But Madam seems to like me.

257
00:20:08,042 --> 00:20:12,542
In the Goddess Religion
that this town believes in,

258
00:20:12,542 --> 00:20:18,750
spiders are holy creatures, the messengers
of the Goddess, like a mythical beast.

259
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:26,458
I remember the Devil also seems to
have such a title of Ancient Mythical Beast.

260
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:32,542
I'm a relative of Devil indeed.
But to be honest, I'm the Devil's enemy.

261
00:20:32,542 --> 00:20:37,333
But according to the Goddess,
isn't this a karma?

262
00:20:37,333 --> 00:20:39,958
I better stop thinking about this.

263
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,208
Someone is coming.

264
00:20:42,917 --> 00:20:48,500
Mythical Beast, please save my child.

265
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:54,958
You want me to save him? But I'm not
the Mythical Beast. You got the wrong spider.

266
00:20:56,792 --> 00:21:00,042
I will just try my best.

267
00:21:04,375 --> 00:21:09,583
Liver cancer? But he's still young.
Is it because of poverty?

268
00:21:09,583 --> 00:21:12,292
"MALNUTRITION"
Or did he just eat anything to fill his stomach?

269
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:16,458
"MALNUTRITION. POOR MUSCULAR AND INTERNAL ORGAN FUNCTIONS"
The mother's condition is also bad.

270
00:21:16,458 --> 00:21:18,083
Please!

271
00:21:18,083 --> 00:21:20,792
Since I have nothing to do, I shall heal them.

272
00:21:31,042 --> 00:21:38,417
Thank me! Take this as a lesson
to start a balance lifestyle and a healthy diet.

273
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,500
Thank you gift? You shouldn't have.
You do good too.

274
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,458
