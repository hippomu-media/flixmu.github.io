1
00:00:17,833 --> 00:00:20,333
Don't be too eager to win.

2
00:00:20,333 --> 00:00:21,375
Brother Hyrince.

3
00:00:21,375 --> 00:00:26,125
According to the elves,
the Imperial Army will arrive in two days.

4
00:00:26,125 --> 00:00:28,500
You won't last if you're already so tensed now.

5
00:00:30,167 --> 00:00:31,167
Alright.

6
00:00:32,917 --> 00:00:36,042
March!

7
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,167
♫The alarm goes off. My name is Little Spider♫

8
00:00:50,167 --> 00:00:52,583
EPISODE 21: SO I'M NOT IN THIS ONE, AM I?
♫The awakening survival skill♫

9
00:00:52,583 --> 00:00:53,167
EPISODE 21: SO I'M NOT IN THIS ONE, AM I?
♫No obstacles can stop me♫

10
00:00:53,167 --> 00:00:56,417
♫No obstacles can stop me♫

11
00:00:56,417 --> 00:00:57,958
♫Go! Dark clouds♫

12
00:01:08,875 --> 00:01:11,375
♫Sometimes I pretend it's fate♫

13
00:01:11,375 --> 00:01:14,125
♫The 3-D perspective street that
appears in the intersection of good and evil♫

14
00:01:14,125 --> 00:01:17,000
♫The labyrinth of nightmares is nothing to me♫

15
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,750
♫Common sense isn't useful here♫

16
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:24,833
♫Charging forward like a man is naive♫

17
00:01:24,833 --> 00:01:29,417

18

♫So you can jump right

29
00:02:18,125 --> 00:02:21,250
Hello, nice to meet you. I'm Kagawa Kunihiko.

30
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:23,125
I'm Kushitani Asaka.

31
00:02:23,125 --> 00:02:26,042
Are you Kunihiko and Asaka?

32
00:02:26,042 --> 00:02:31,250
Who's the one that defeated one
of the commander in the fight with Demon Clan?

33
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:33,333
That will be us.

34
00:02:33,333 --> 00:02:37,292
It wasn't just the two of us who defeated them.

35
00:02:37,292 --> 00:02:41,458
It's reassuring to have
two strong people in our team.

36
00:02:41,458 --> 00:02:42,958
Yes.

37
00:02:42,958 --> 00:02:46,625
They seem to be famous adventurers.

38
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:49,208
Are you envious?

39
00:02:49,208 --> 00:02:52,958
Yes. Because I haven't had any accomplishment.

40
00:02:52,958 --> 00:02:54,500
You will have them soon.

41
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:58,708
Are we going to survey the barrier now?
Let's go.

42
00:02:58,708 --> 00:03:01,083
Please lead the way.

43
00:03:03,208 --> 00:03:05,708
They should at least answer.

44
00:03:14,875 --> 00:03:16,875
This is the border.

45
00:03:16,875 --> 00:03:18,917
How is it underground?

46
00:03:18,917 --> 00:03:23,000
There are barriers underground and in the air.

47
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,750
I see. Can I check how strong they are?

48
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:29,917
Go ahead.

49
00:03:29,917 --> 00:03:33,625
Okay. Stay away.

50
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,917
Is that a magical sword?

51
00:03:50,542 --> 00:03:55,667
It's made of defeated dragons.
Same goes to Asaka's stick.

52
00:03:55,667 --> 00:04:01,000
Let me clarify this.
Kunihiko and I only joined the crusade team.

53
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,667
But this is powerful indeed.
It seems hard to destroy.

54
00:04:05,667 --> 00:04:06,917
Fei, what do you think?

55
00:04:06,917 --> 00:04:10,292
If that didn't work, I can't do anything either.

56
00:04:10,292 --> 00:04:13,250
This is the Iron Barrier the elves are proud of.

57
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:15,417
I wonder if Natsume can destroy it.

58
00:04:15,417 --> 00:04:18,458
Is there a need to destroy it?

59
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:21,708
The goal of the Imperial Army
is to suppress the elves.

60
00:04:21,708 --> 00:04:25,708
If the barrier is in the way,
just remove it from inside.

61
00:04:25,708 --> 00:04:27,292
How to remove it?

62
00:04:27,292 --> 00:04:33,833
It's simple. Just enter through
Teleport Formation like us and then remove it.

63
00:04:33,833 --> 00:04:36,917
Or have someone in here remove it.

64
00:04:36,917 --> 00:04:39,625
What you mean is, there may be a spy inside?

65
00:04:39,625 --> 00:04:41,875
I'm just saying it's possible.

66
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:47,750
Hugo who leads the Imperial Army knows
how to brainwash. If he uses it...

67
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:51,000
We will never give in to that kind of person.

68
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:57,083
True. But just in case, I think we should stop
the operation of the Teleport Formation for now.

69
00:04:57,083 --> 00:04:59,875
No need. No matter what trick he uses,

70
00:04:59,875 --> 00:05:03,708
we will not be fooled by a mere human.

71
00:05:05,042 --> 00:05:10,125
You are the one who shouldn't
make any stupid mistake.

72
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:12,000
The disgrace of our clan.

73
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,667
How dare you be back here?

74
00:05:14,667 --> 00:05:16,792
What do you mean?

75
00:05:18,542 --> 00:05:24,542
It doesn't matter, the barrier is verified.
We should get back to discuss the strategy.

76
00:05:24,542 --> 00:05:27,542
That's right. Let's go, Anna.

77
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:34,708
Do we have to protect these guys?

78
00:05:38,792 --> 00:05:41,917
We're so far away from where we stay.

79
00:05:41,917 --> 00:05:45,417
What should we do next? Look for everyone?

80
00:05:45,417 --> 00:05:46,792
No. I...

81
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:49,292
Teacher.

82
00:05:49,292 --> 00:05:52,958
Guards, just stop here. Let me do the rest.

83
00:05:52,958 --> 00:05:53,833
But...

84
00:05:53,833 --> 00:05:55,500
Everything will be fine.

85
00:06:02,417 --> 00:06:06,792
Before the battle,
I have something important to tell you.

86
00:06:06,792 --> 00:06:08,125
We shall go first.

87
00:06:09,125 --> 00:06:13,000
No need. In fact, I want to tell you two more.

88
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,875
What?

89
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:17,250
Perhaps you've noticed it.

90
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:23,458
We're reincarnations
who have memories of the other world.

91
00:06:24,583 --> 00:06:26,833
Reincarnations?

92
00:06:26,833 --> 00:06:28,208
Reincarnations have many skills

93
00:06:28,208 --> 00:06:31,792
and skill points since born.

94
00:06:31,792 --> 00:06:37,208
Because of these conditions,
Shun and I have extraordinary powers.

95
00:06:37,208 --> 00:06:42,208
But we didn't have these skills, levels
and so on in our original world.

96
00:06:42,208 --> 00:06:45,000
There were also no monsters and demons.

97
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,417
Although it wasn't a peaceful world,
it was a stable one.

98
00:06:50,667 --> 00:06:55,583
It's hard to believe it.
But seeing how you are now,

99
00:06:55,583 --> 00:06:57,542
I can understand.

100
00:06:57,542 --> 00:07:01,708
Even if this is real,
why did you end up in this world?

101
00:07:01,708 --> 00:07:08,708
I think someone did this intentionally.
The elves have an old legend.

102
00:07:08,708 --> 00:07:14,833
God will target on the lives of those
came from another world and take their powers.

103
00:07:16,417 --> 00:07:20,167
The elves call this God Admin.
They contend with It.

104
00:07:20,167 --> 00:07:22,958
The elves protect the reincarnations

105
00:07:22,958 --> 00:07:25,583
to prevent them from being killed by the admins

106
00:07:25,583 --> 00:07:28,875
and grab all their powers.

107
00:07:28,875 --> 00:07:31,833
God? Admin?

108
00:07:31,833 --> 00:07:36,042
It's far from the topic.

109
00:07:36,042 --> 00:07:39,042
I also don't think these are true.

110
00:07:39,042 --> 00:07:43,625
But the existence
of the so-called Admins is real.

111
00:07:45,542 --> 00:07:47,208
And the Admins wanted

112
00:07:47,208 --> 00:07:52,625
Hugo to kill the king of Analeit
and have the Imperial Army attack here.

113
00:07:52,625 --> 00:07:53,667
What?

114
00:07:53,667 --> 00:07:58,750
Hold on. You mean this is not caused by Hugo?

115
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:00,375
Natsume...

116
00:08:00,375 --> 00:08:02,708
Hugo was just used.

117
00:08:02,708 --> 00:08:07,208
The proof is Sophia, who's by his side.

118
00:08:07,208 --> 00:08:11,542
Sophia Keren.
Her name in the previous life is Negishi Shouko.

119
00:08:11,542 --> 00:08:14,917
She's one of the reincarnations
who's on the Admins' side.

120
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:24,292
I really don't want to see
my students killing each other.

121
00:08:25,417 --> 00:08:29,042
Please protect these children.

122
00:08:32,082 --> 00:08:37,166
Please, you must live.

123
00:08:42,082 --> 00:08:44,292
Let's sort out the intelligence.

124
00:08:44,292 --> 00:08:50,042
First, the barrier that protects
Elf Village is a huge protective screen.

125
00:08:50,042 --> 00:08:52,417
It's hard to be destroyed.

126
00:08:52,417 --> 00:08:58,542
If one were to invade the village, he will have
to use the Teleport Formation like Katia said.

127
00:08:58,542 --> 00:09:02,792
Although it's tightly guarded,
it's not impossible.

128
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:09,750
If we protect Teleport Formation well,
we can prevent Imperial Army from invading.

129
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:14,750
Which means we have to protect
Teleport Formation, right?

130
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:17,000
Are there any objections?

131
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,125
What if the elves are brainwashed?

132
00:09:20,125 --> 00:09:22,792
Then we will have no other ways.

133
00:09:22,792 --> 00:09:24,250
Seriously?

134
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:28,292
We have no time to identify all the elves.

135
00:09:28,292 --> 00:09:31,583
But it doesn't sound good if we do nothing.

136
00:09:31,583 --> 00:09:35,167
The worst situation would be
when they invade through Teleport Formation

137
00:09:35,167 --> 00:09:38,667
while the brainwashed elves start a riot.

138
00:09:38,667 --> 00:09:42,750
It's possible that the barrier
may be destroyed like that.

139
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:46,292
That would be bad.

140
00:09:46,292 --> 00:09:49,792
Have you forgotten the worst thing?

141
00:09:49,792 --> 00:09:55,542
The one who's harder to deal with
than Natsume is Negishi.

142
00:09:55,542 --> 00:10:00,250
Rihoko is now called Sophia, right?
Is she that tricky?

143
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:04,333
She has the ability to invalid magic.

144
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:06,917
What? That's too much.

145
00:10:06,917 --> 00:10:10,875
Yes. Can that be used against the barrier?

146
00:10:10,875 --> 00:10:12,250
I don't know.

147
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:14,792
This is not a game.

148
00:10:14,792 --> 00:10:19,750
Besides, Negishi isn't
the only reincarnation on their side.

149
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:24,708
What we know for sure is
these three are on the opposite side.

150
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:32,583
Besides, according to the teacher,
there are two more missing reincarnations.

151
00:10:37,417 --> 00:10:42,542
Kusama and Kyouya.
What's the chance of them on their side?

152
00:10:42,542 --> 00:10:43,917
Teacher mentioned,

153
00:10:43,917 --> 00:10:47,792
Negishi isn't the only reincarnations
on the Admin's side.

154
00:10:47,792 --> 00:10:52,042
That means,
either Kusama or Kyouya is on their side.

155
00:10:52,042 --> 00:10:55,250
Or perhaps both of them are.
We can't tell for sure.

156
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:58,292
Do you think Kyouya is also on Hugo's side?

157
00:10:58,292 --> 00:11:03,750
Considering his personality in the previous life
it's hard to believe he'll be on Hugo's side.

158
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:05,125
However...

159
00:11:05,125 --> 00:11:10,292
Yes. Kyouya might have changed too.

160
00:11:10,292 --> 00:11:13,583
Who can recall something about Kusama?

161
00:11:16,167 --> 00:11:19,750
Sorry, Kusama.
Honestly, I've forgotten about him.

162
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:21,417
That's true.

163
00:11:21,417 --> 00:11:27,500
If it's Shinobu, I think he's just running
errands without knowing the plot.

164
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:32,042
Besides Natsume and Negishi,
there are two more unknown reincarnations.

165
00:11:33,042 --> 00:11:35,417
I'm getting worried.

166
00:11:35,417 --> 00:11:39,042
Despite so, we have to do something.

167
00:11:39,042 --> 00:11:43,583
Excuse me for disrupting your conversation.
What's your point?

168
00:11:43,583 --> 00:11:44,458
What?

169
00:11:44,458 --> 00:11:48,500
This war is the battle between
the elves and the empire.

170
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:53,125
We're just here to help. Not to win for sure.

171
00:11:53,125 --> 00:11:55,250
But if we lose, the elves will...

172
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:57,542
Don't you mess up the priority.

173
00:11:57,542 --> 00:12:00,125
We will surely try our best to help them.

174
00:12:00,125 --> 00:12:05,458
But if you're going to die doing it,
please consider to retreat.

175
00:12:07,417 --> 00:12:11,792
I don't want to watch another
important person die again.

176
00:12:11,792 --> 00:12:14,542
Filimøs must think the same.

177
00:12:16,833 --> 00:12:18,583
I get it.

178
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:25,917
But I can't see people suffer.

179
00:12:25,917 --> 00:12:31,292
Didn't Julius say the same thing?
Do what your ability allows you.

180
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:32,583
Yes.

181
00:12:32,583 --> 00:12:38,375
Very well.
Let's protect Teleport Formation as proposed.

182
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:43,708
Since the elves wouldn't help us,
we have to try our best to survive.

183
00:12:43,708 --> 00:12:48,125
Tomorrow is the final battle.
Get ready for the battlefield.

184
00:12:48,125 --> 00:12:49,250
Yes.

185
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,083
How can a mere human destroy our barrier?

186
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:06,083
I would love to see that.

187
00:13:07,375 --> 00:13:11,375
Be it destroying the barrier
or invading through Teleport Formation,

188
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:14,542
no matter what they do, they will do it today.

189
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:20,000
Who are you? Where are you from?

190
00:13:20,542 --> 00:13:22,792
Hold on.

191
00:13:22,792 --> 00:13:24,542
What's going on?

192
00:13:24,542 --> 00:13:26,000
Behave yourself.

193
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,250
That was close. I might have died.
Do you want to kill me?

194
00:13:30,417 --> 00:13:34,167
Turns out you do want to kill me. I see.

195
00:13:34,167 --> 00:13:37,833
It's Shun and Kanata. And Kunihiko.
Long time no see.

196
00:13:37,833 --> 00:13:39,958
And the others.

197
00:13:39,958 --> 00:13:42,875
This tone... Could you be...

198
00:13:42,875 --> 00:13:44,125
Kusama?

199
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:47,167
Yes. How are you?

200
00:13:47,167 --> 00:13:52,708
Kusama. You know about us.
That means you're on the enemy's side, right?

201
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:57,667
Enemy? I think so.

202
00:13:57,667 --> 00:14:00,250
Okay. Catch him alive.

203
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:04,250
So many people are attacking at once.
How can I win?

204
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:06,542
Kusama. This skill...

205
00:14:06,542 --> 00:14:10,042
KUSAMA SHINOBU. NINJA.
Isn't it too obvious to be called ninja?

206
00:14:10,042 --> 00:14:11,208
Well...

207
00:14:13,375 --> 00:14:14,625
It's so scary.

208
00:14:18,333 --> 00:14:21,167
Hey, Shun. Do you want to kill me?

209
00:14:21,167 --> 00:14:23,542
Duplication and illusion.

210
00:14:23,542 --> 00:14:24,750
Surround him.

211
00:14:26,708 --> 00:14:28,042
Hold on.

212
00:14:28,042 --> 00:14:31,500
Charging at once is too cunning.

213
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:42,167
Cursed you. That old man lied to me
saying this is an easy task.

214
00:14:42,167 --> 00:14:43,542
Don't you try to escape.

215
00:14:45,292 --> 00:14:47,333
You should run faster.

216
00:14:51,083 --> 00:14:52,875
EXPLOSION SWORD

217
00:14:52,875 --> 00:14:55,083
Run, everyone!

218
00:14:55,083 --> 00:14:56,125
Shun!

219
00:14:57,583 --> 00:14:59,292
It's useless. Give up.

220
00:14:59,292 --> 00:15:00,500
How can I?

221
00:15:15,625 --> 00:15:17,875
Teleport Formation.

222
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:21,875
The magical sword detonated like a bomb.

223
00:15:21,875 --> 00:15:27,083
Kusama's goal was to trap us in the barrier.

224
00:15:33,125 --> 00:15:37,917
Take this time to conserve your energy.
The highlight is yet to come.

225
00:15:37,917 --> 00:15:38,583
No...

226
00:15:38,583 --> 00:15:40,000
What?

227
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,083
He didn't destroy Teleport Formation to trap us.

228
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:54,125
What's going on?

229
00:16:04,125 --> 00:16:06,167
Get ready to fight.

230
00:16:07,625 --> 00:16:09,208
The barrier...

231
00:16:12,042 --> 00:16:15,583
The barrier is gone.
Teleport Formation is useless as well.

232
00:16:15,583 --> 00:16:20,167
They can no longer escape.
Kill everyone of them.

233
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:37,458
This is the garden of the elves.

234
00:16:37,458 --> 00:16:39,583
I shall show them

235
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:42,958
how stupid it is to
fight the elves in the woods.

236
00:16:45,083 --> 00:16:48,250
The elves who rebel against God have to die.

237
00:16:49,042 --> 00:16:50,500
Attack!

238
00:16:56,958 --> 00:17:00,750
Hang in there, Yuri.

239
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:02,500
Skill. Student List.

240
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:03,250
STUDENT LIST

241
00:17:03,667 --> 00:17:06,583
KENGO NATSUME.
DIED IN A BATTLE IN THE ELF FOREST.

242
00:17:10,458 --> 00:17:12,833
How did this happen?

243
00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:18,667
I just wanted to save my students.

244
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:30,208
Oka, I'm so happy. You take the lead to meet me.

245
00:17:30,208 --> 00:17:33,042
I'm happy as well.

246
00:17:39,542 --> 00:17:40,708
Negishi.

247
00:17:40,708 --> 00:17:43,667
I told you not to call me by that name.

248
00:17:43,667 --> 00:17:47,292
Sophia, don't interrupt.

249
00:17:47,292 --> 00:17:50,875
Really? Then I shall watch the battle.

250
00:17:51,542 --> 00:17:57,083
Come on.
If you don't come down, I will get there.

251
00:17:57,792 --> 00:17:59,042
Dragon Wind.

252
00:18:03,667 --> 00:18:06,000
Such magic is useless.

253
00:18:12,708 --> 00:18:16,750
Was that the power of
the magical sword that offset my Dragon Wind?

254
00:18:18,792 --> 00:18:23,125
Do you think I'm still the trash
who you took away the power from?

255
00:18:23,125 --> 00:18:26,292
It was the power of your equipment
yet you dare to brag.

256
00:18:34,625 --> 00:18:38,292
Do you know the reason I became stronger?

257
00:18:43,208 --> 00:18:45,125
Don't be arrogant.

258
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,375
Hide!

259
00:18:50,333 --> 00:18:54,208
Elves are infidels. Infidels must die!

260
00:18:58,542 --> 00:19:01,083
You should know one of the points.

261
00:19:01,083 --> 00:19:06,625
The skill, Charm.
A great skill that helps me control others.

262
00:19:09,625 --> 00:19:15,500
I have another powerful skill, Avarice.

263
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:18,000
Avarice?

264
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,417
Yes. One of the seven sinful skills.

265
00:19:24,292 --> 00:19:27,250
It can take away the skills of someone you kill.

266
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:31,417
But one can only get a little bit of skills,
ability values and skill points.

267
00:19:31,417 --> 00:19:33,292
That's the way.

268
00:19:33,292 --> 00:19:35,583
Thanks to you, I've become stronger than before.

269
00:19:35,583 --> 00:19:38,042
Thank you, teacher.

270
00:19:38,042 --> 00:19:43,458
How many lives have you taken?

271
00:19:43,458 --> 00:19:45,625
How much have you sinned?

272
00:19:56,125 --> 00:19:59,750
Teacher, please take a nap.

273
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:06,333
It's okay. God will heal your poisoned mind.

274
00:20:12,292 --> 00:20:16,167
You did such things to a student.
You're not qualified as a teacher.

275
00:20:16,167 --> 00:20:19,958
You're not qualified to criticise me.

276
00:20:19,958 --> 00:20:22,167
What are you doing?

277
00:20:24,667 --> 00:20:29,625
It's a barrier.
Although it's not as big as Elf Village's,

278
00:20:30,708 --> 00:20:32,750
you can't crack it.

279
00:20:34,083 --> 00:20:35,792
Breath...

280
00:20:37,292 --> 00:20:42,833
It's different from the Elf Village's barrier.
The inside of the barrier slowly loses oxygen.

281
00:20:46,917 --> 00:20:51,833
It's over, Natsume. No, Hugo.

282
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:00,667
That's horrible.

283
00:21:00,667 --> 00:21:03,875
And you told me not to interrupt.

284
00:21:05,083 --> 00:21:07,250
Don't say that.

285
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:13,875
I didn't expect Oka
to have such a powerful skill.

286
00:21:14,958 --> 00:21:17,625
Negishi.

287
00:21:17,625 --> 00:21:21,042
But this is over like that.

288
00:21:24,917 --> 00:21:28,458
Can someone please tell me,

289
00:21:28,458 --> 00:21:32,958
if I've done my duty as a teacher?

290
00:21:37,083 --> 00:21:39,625
Sorry for being late, teacher.

291
00:21:42,167 --> 00:21:44,125
