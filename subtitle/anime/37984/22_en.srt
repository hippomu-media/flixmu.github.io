1
00:00:10,792 --> 00:00:13,167
They're in a war.

2
00:00:13,167 --> 00:00:14,833
Yes, we're right on site.

3
00:00:14,833 --> 00:00:20,458
We're near the battlefield.
No, we're right in the middle of it.

4
00:00:20,458 --> 00:00:25,792
Looking around, it's full of people here.

5
00:00:25,792 --> 00:00:28,125
It's warm. This heat.

6
00:00:28,125 --> 00:00:29,875
"SO I'M A CLOUD, SO WHAT?"
Isn't this the common scene

7
00:00:29,875 --> 00:00:34,833
that appears in the summer
and winter Comic Expo?

8
00:00:34,833 --> 00:00:40,375
If I get myself involved,
I may get dizzy in the crowd.

9
00:00:40,375 --> 00:00:43,542
Anyone has anything against dizziness?

10
00:00:45,208 --> 00:00:46,875
The gust of explosion is so strong.

11
00:00:46,875 --> 00:00:51,917
If I don't pay attention,
my body may not stand it.

12
00:00:53,458 --> 00:00:55,708
Rain of blood that's flowing this way.

13
00:00:55,708 --> 00:00:59,208
I predict the scene will get bloodier.

14
00:00:59,208 --> 00:01:03,917
Audience at home,
please do not leave home to join the battle.

15
00:01:03,917 --> 00:01:04,708
That's the report from...

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,167
♫The alarm goes off. My name is Little Spider♫

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,750
♫Common sense isn't useful here♫

♫So you can jump right

38
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:41,042
On one side,
there's Sariella with a 42,000-strong army.

39
00:02:41,042 --> 00:02:43,750
Go, go, Sariella!

40
00:02:45,375 --> 00:02:48,875
On the other side,
there's Ohts Alliance with 53,000 people.

41
00:02:48,875 --> 00:02:50,917
Go, Ohts!

42
00:02:51,583 --> 00:02:55,167
It's about half the scale
of the battle of Sekihara.

43
00:02:55,167 --> 00:03:00,000
So it's not a decisive battle,
but a half-decisive battle?

44
00:03:01,583 --> 00:03:04,875
Fight, fight harder.

45
00:03:04,875 --> 00:03:05,958
Go!

46
00:03:05,958 --> 00:03:08,375
Here it comes. Did he cross the line?

47
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:13,750
Even such a poor young man have to fight?

48
00:03:14,708 --> 00:03:17,125
Why did this happen?

49
00:03:17,125 --> 00:03:19,958
What's the reason? Why must there be wars?

50
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:24,750
That's right. I seem to be the reason.

51
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:29,000
Because I accidentally killed
that repulsive fatso.

52
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,792
That fatso was a diplomatic envoy of Ohts.
Oh no.

53
00:03:32,792 --> 00:03:35,000
I seem to have caused a war.

54
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
But it's not my fault.

55
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,583
They're too hot-tempered
to start a war so suddenly.

56
00:03:40,583 --> 00:03:44,167
No matter what, you fight because of me, right?

57
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:49,333
Stop the war. Don't fight because of me.

58
00:03:49,333 --> 00:03:50,458
I'm just kidding.

59
00:03:50,458 --> 00:03:51,875
To think about it,

60
00:03:51,875 --> 00:03:56,583
when I fought the Devil,
my strength wasn't strong enough.

61
00:03:56,583 --> 00:04:01,583
In order to stop this world from collapsing,
I have to upgrade my level.

62
00:04:01,583 --> 00:04:06,458
Okay. How's the situation over there with Devil?
Please tell us.

63
00:04:06,458 --> 00:04:09,000
Okay. This is the Great Elroe Labyrinth.

64
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,042
Devil is now fighting with
a very powerful earth dragon.

65
00:04:13,042 --> 00:04:18,250
Great. Now is the golden opportunity.

66
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:21,875
Human experience levels are more
and yummier than those of the monsters'.

67
00:04:21,875 --> 00:04:24,625
War is a delicious feast.

68
00:04:24,625 --> 00:04:27,333
I see a experience-value clump.

69
00:04:28,167 --> 00:04:31,417
Time to upgrade my experience level.

70
00:04:32,125 --> 00:04:37,542
First of all, Sariella worships me
and the vampire child is also on this side.

71
00:04:37,542 --> 00:04:41,167
I want to join Sariella in the war.

72
00:04:42,708 --> 00:04:44,625
There are many people indeed.

73
00:04:45,375 --> 00:04:46,625
I'm becoming dizzy.

74
00:04:47,042 --> 00:04:48,417
However...

75
00:04:48,417 --> 00:04:52,333
Experience level!

76
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:54,792
I received them all.

77
00:04:57,417 --> 00:04:58,542
Odd.

78
00:05:06,375 --> 00:05:08,208
Have I gone too far?

79
00:05:10,542 --> 00:05:12,792
My level has been upgraded indeed.

80
00:05:13,458 --> 00:05:15,167
The sharp stare of the humans.

81
00:05:15,167 --> 00:05:17,750
I should leave as soon as possible.

82
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Terminator... No, not him.

83
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,833
Someone teleported here.

84
00:05:30,833 --> 00:05:33,458
I have a bad feeling.

85
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:39,000
How is this possible?

86
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:57,333
You're very stubborn.
You've obviously been destroyed.

87
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:02,375
Look at how hard you're breathing.

88
00:06:02,375 --> 00:06:05,875
Therefore, Good Morning Star!

89
00:06:09,417 --> 00:06:11,667
Good morning.

90
00:06:11,667 --> 00:06:14,042
What a special name.

91
00:06:14,042 --> 00:06:15,583
You're wordy.

92
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:18,833
It was a slip of tongue.

93
00:06:18,833 --> 00:06:23,042
Forget it. This is your chance to escape. Go.

94
00:06:23,042 --> 00:06:26,625
If you take another strike from me
in this condition, you'll be dead.

95
00:06:26,625 --> 00:06:32,292
If you say yes, I'll retreat.

96
00:06:32,292 --> 00:06:34,542
Ancient monsters...

97
00:06:35,292 --> 00:06:38,292
You're talking about eliminating the antiques?

98
00:06:38,292 --> 00:06:41,625
So you're planning to pass
everything to the newcomers?

99
00:06:41,625 --> 00:06:43,083
What a joke.

100
00:06:43,083 --> 00:06:47,875
Yes. The antiques that
should be eliminated include us.

101
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:51,083
So you're not going to retreat?

102
00:06:51,083 --> 00:06:53,583
The obstacle of ancient monsters.

103
00:06:53,583 --> 00:06:58,542
There's nothing better than
dying from perseverance.

104
00:06:58,542 --> 00:07:01,083
Keep enjoying this.

105
00:07:01,083 --> 00:07:05,292
I just want to swallow everything.

106
00:07:05,292 --> 00:07:08,667
With this skill that I took from Mother...

107
00:07:09,958 --> 00:07:12,875
It seems you've been badly nibbled.

108
00:07:15,875 --> 00:07:17,125
Body.

109
00:07:27,125 --> 00:07:28,375
Is it done?

110
00:07:28,375 --> 00:07:31,792
It's about time for me to finish as well.

111
00:07:31,792 --> 00:07:35,167
Why don't you mention the special name again?

112
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:36,333
Shut up!

113
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:43,750
Well done.

114
00:07:47,083 --> 00:07:49,958
That's what I want to say.

115
00:07:49,958 --> 00:07:54,625
I haven't met such a tricky opponent
like you for awhile.

116
00:07:54,625 --> 00:07:57,333
Just as I wish.

117
00:08:03,708 --> 00:08:07,292
Another ancient monster has disappeared.

118
00:08:07,292 --> 00:08:11,042
It's not that I agree with what you told me,

119
00:08:11,042 --> 00:08:15,917
but when I killed this earth dragon
that had been around since forever,

120
00:08:15,917 --> 00:08:18,833
I can't help but think...

121
00:08:18,833 --> 00:08:22,708
I have to eat up this huge body.

122
00:08:22,708 --> 00:08:25,583
Wasting food is against my principle.

123
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:33,458
Hold on. Do I have such a principle?

124
00:08:35,542 --> 00:08:37,000
Okay, whatever.

125
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,917
No, this is not good as well.

126
00:08:39,917 --> 00:08:43,750
My way of thinking is
very different from the original me.

127
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:44,917
What's going on?

128
00:08:44,917 --> 00:08:48,167
Something seems to have invaded my soul

129
00:08:48,167 --> 00:08:50,125
and it's planning to fuse into me.

130
00:08:53,917 --> 00:08:56,833
The sense of violation is fusing with me.

131
00:08:56,833 --> 00:08:58,958
It's as if it has infiltrated into my body.

132
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:02,333
Forget it. Whatever.

133
00:09:03,667 --> 00:09:07,958
I'm afraid that I'm thinking this.

134
00:09:07,958 --> 00:09:13,750
But no matter what,
I have to eat this earth dragon in front of me.

135
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:18,667
Besides, I'm hungry after the war.

136
00:09:18,667 --> 00:09:20,083
I shall start eating.

137
00:09:20,083 --> 00:09:21,708
No way.

138
00:09:22,542 --> 00:09:24,458
Gülie?

139
00:09:24,458 --> 00:09:27,667
Which side do you belong now?

140
00:09:27,667 --> 00:09:30,167
What do you mean?

141
00:09:30,167 --> 00:09:34,417
You should feel that
you have a sense of violation, right?

142
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:36,125
Hello.

143
00:09:36,125 --> 00:09:39,083
Which side do you think I'm on now?

144
00:09:39,083 --> 00:09:42,458
On both sides or on neither side.

145
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:48,792
You're too confused now to judge
which side you belong.

146
00:09:48,792 --> 00:09:52,000
Your consciousness is leaning to Ariel's side.

147
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,958
It's indeed so.

148
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:56,958
But your way of thinking
is biased towards the other side.

149
00:09:56,958 --> 00:09:59,708
What's going on?

150
00:09:59,708 --> 00:10:06,083
It's the result of resistance
after your soul being corroded by the person,

151
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:09,167
which leads to the fusion of
both yours and that person's soul.

152
00:10:09,167 --> 00:10:10,625
I knew it.

153
00:10:10,625 --> 00:10:17,542
No wonder I've become odd and eager to fight.
I was a careful person.

154
00:10:17,542 --> 00:10:19,500
In other word, coward.

155
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,042
Cut the crap.

156
00:10:21,042 --> 00:10:23,958
Anyway, who's that person?

157
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:29,708
Just explore the memory of your union
with that person's soul to find out.

158
00:10:32,542 --> 00:10:34,333
Reincarnation.

159
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:37,875
But what's a reincarnation?

160
00:10:37,875 --> 00:10:44,667
They're guests invited by Admin D into
this world. This is maybe the best description.

161
00:10:44,667 --> 00:10:47,250
Invited?

162
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:51,750
Admin D's rank is higher than you, right?

163
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:54,792
She's a god with strong powers.

164
00:10:55,667 --> 00:11:01,083
That means this god brought in new souls
from another world at this critical moment?

165
00:11:01,083 --> 00:11:05,208
Right. In order to change this world
which is going to be destroyed.

166
00:11:05,208 --> 00:11:10,333
So the new wind that Gakia
mentioned is already blowing?

167
00:11:10,333 --> 00:11:13,417
You don't have to know that now.

168
00:11:13,417 --> 00:11:19,000
That's right. I don't want
to know what Admin D's plan is.

169
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:24,833
To be honest, because of her soul,
my fighting spirit dropped sharply.

170
00:11:24,833 --> 00:11:29,083
But I have to ask back what she owes me.

171
00:11:29,083 --> 00:11:30,583
Really?

172
00:11:30,583 --> 00:11:32,417
Don't try to stop me.

173
00:11:32,417 --> 00:11:35,208
I will send you to her.

174
00:11:36,125 --> 00:11:38,958
What do you have in mind?

175
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:42,542
Take it as a sorry for the trouble
caused by my subordinate.

176
00:11:57,708 --> 00:12:01,083
Sorry to disturb you.

177
00:12:01,083 --> 00:12:05,208
Can you please die first?

178
00:12:05,208 --> 00:12:07,708
"DEATH PENALTY DECLARED"
What?

179
00:12:09,583 --> 00:12:11,542
I'm so tired. This expression.

180
00:12:11,542 --> 00:12:12,458
I said it wrong.

181
00:12:12,458 --> 00:12:13,875
How did this happen?

182
00:12:13,875 --> 00:12:16,750
Why is my arch enemy, Devil, here?

183
00:12:18,667 --> 00:12:22,500
What should I do in this worst situation?
Flee, of course.

184
00:12:25,458 --> 00:12:28,667
It hurts. What's going on?

185
00:12:28,667 --> 00:12:34,375
I wanted to teleport but as if
I've ran into a wall and I'm back here.

186
00:12:34,375 --> 00:12:38,208
Oh no. Could she have set a barrier?

187
00:12:54,583 --> 00:12:58,083
Hold on. This is not a joke.

188
00:12:58,917 --> 00:13:01,417
I intentionally aimed wrongly.

189
00:13:01,417 --> 00:13:03,458
No. That was a lie.

190
00:13:03,458 --> 00:13:05,125
I will play with you later.

191
00:13:05,125 --> 00:13:07,333
I don't need it.

192
00:13:07,333 --> 00:13:08,833
Here she comes.

193
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:13,708
Seriously?

194
00:13:13,708 --> 00:13:18,083
This barrier can stop Teleport and magic?

195
00:13:18,083 --> 00:13:19,333
Liar!

196
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,042
Do you think I would say that?

197
00:13:22,042 --> 00:13:26,542
My ability value increased a lot
after the takeover from mother.

198
00:13:26,542 --> 00:13:34,250
I'm no longer that me
who can be destroyed by just a hit.

199
00:13:35,542 --> 00:13:38,542
Although I can only defend.

200
00:13:45,708 --> 00:13:51,208
Oh my, the surrounding disaster is so serious.
It's as if a huge typhoon swept by.

201
00:13:58,708 --> 00:14:02,542
So simple magic can be used?

202
00:14:03,042 --> 00:14:07,208
Okay. I shall fight back with
the low-resistance Light Magic.

203
00:14:09,625 --> 00:14:14,083
Got it. I've become stronger indeed.

204
00:14:16,083 --> 00:14:19,000
The speed of reborn is so fast.

205
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Come on.

206
00:14:28,625 --> 00:14:31,000
It's so scary.

207
00:14:32,667 --> 00:14:34,750
Don't come close.

208
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,292
So fast. Run now.

209
00:14:38,292 --> 00:14:39,208
So fast.

210
00:14:39,208 --> 00:14:41,417
I have not thought of a strategy.

211
00:14:41,417 --> 00:14:43,917
Her expression hasn't changed.

212
00:14:43,917 --> 00:14:48,458
She's chewing. As if she's eating something.

213
00:14:49,292 --> 00:14:52,583
She swallowed something to recover her SP value.

214
00:14:52,583 --> 00:14:55,792
This can't be the devastating skill, right?

215
00:14:57,250 --> 00:15:01,167
That means Devil can eat anything.

216
00:15:01,167 --> 00:15:03,875
Doesn't matter if it's soil or anything.

217
00:15:03,875 --> 00:15:06,500
Your bowel is very strong indeed.

218
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:09,667
You can even recover from it.
I really have no way now.

219
00:15:10,792 --> 00:15:11,708
Oh no!

220
00:15:12,583 --> 00:15:15,875
It's like a fight in manga.

221
00:15:18,917 --> 00:15:24,167
It feels like I'm crushing
bubble wrap under my body.

222
00:15:24,167 --> 00:15:28,167
Experience level obtained. Recover. Peel.

223
00:15:28,167 --> 00:15:29,500
Hold on, Devil.

224
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:32,625
Are you sure you didn't confuse
the reason for your debut?

225
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:37,875
It's as if a protagonist of a manga
is appearing in the real world.

226
00:15:40,042 --> 00:15:43,625
Experience level obtained. Recover. Peel.

227
00:15:44,542 --> 00:15:48,917
I could upgrade level and recover all because
of the experience levels of the dead soldiers.

228
00:15:48,917 --> 00:15:52,333
Sorry, unknown soldiers. Thank you so much.

229
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:56,167
But I've peeled so much
that my body is in pain now.

230
00:16:03,667 --> 00:16:05,125
Oh no. Will I be screwed?

231
00:16:05,125 --> 00:16:07,917
Monsters. Let me be your opponent.

232
00:16:10,083 --> 00:16:10,917
What?

233
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:14,500
Lad, what do you want to do?

234
00:16:16,042 --> 00:16:18,542
What? What's going on?

235
00:16:18,542 --> 00:16:20,917
Why isn't Devil moving?

236
00:16:21,458 --> 00:16:24,333
Could Devil like young boys?

237
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:29,750
And me? I'm a monster indeed.

238
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,833
Someone please tell me what's going on.

239
00:16:33,833 --> 00:16:36,500
Who is this kid? My name is...

240
00:16:37,958 --> 00:16:41,292
Warrior. A warrior appears after Devil?

241
00:16:41,292 --> 00:16:46,500
His ability value is more suitable for
a fantasy novel compared to those of Devil's.

242
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,958
He's too weak.

243
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:53,708
He's very excellent for a kid
and way better than the soldiers.

244
00:16:53,708 --> 00:16:57,083
But the Devil is obviously careful about him.

245
00:16:57,083 --> 00:17:00,917
Why? He's a child. You can easily defeat him.

246
00:17:03,542 --> 00:17:05,958
What's with this odd triangle?

247
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:10,083
Talking about triangle. It should be
about a snake, a frog and a slug, right?

248
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:12,416
We're are none of them.

249
00:17:12,416 --> 00:17:14,957
Okay. Activate Wisdom secretly.

250
00:17:14,958 --> 00:17:17,083
Search Warrior.

251
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:18,000
HIDDEN EFFECT OF THE TITLE. HAVE THE ABILITY
TO DEFEAT DEVIL IN A SPLIT SECOND.

252
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,041
That's it.

253
00:17:19,041 --> 00:17:21,957
Turns out to be a selfish setting
because of the system.

254
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:24,375
Because of this guarding effect,

255
00:17:24,375 --> 00:17:25,833
Devil doesn't dare to attack this boy... No,

256
00:17:25,833 --> 00:17:29,208
I mean she doesn't dare
to attack the young Warrior.

257
00:17:29,208 --> 00:17:32,333
This is the only trump card against Devil.

258
00:17:32,333 --> 00:17:36,542
Can I make good use of it in this situation?

259
00:17:36,542 --> 00:17:39,833
Think quickly!

260
00:17:40,917 --> 00:17:43,000
Who's being busybody?

261
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:43,875
You're interrupting...

262
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:47,208
No. You're planning to destroy Warrior and us?

263
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:52,083
Little Warrior, if you're distracted now...

264
00:17:52,083 --> 00:17:53,167
Oh no!

265
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:59,167
This is Abyss Magic. Immortality wouldn't work.

266
00:17:59,167 --> 00:18:04,375
Oh no! I will surely be dead.

267
00:18:15,708 --> 00:18:17,042
Shoot!

268
00:18:24,708 --> 00:18:29,167
I didn't expect to see you besides Oka.
This is touching.

269
00:18:29,167 --> 00:18:33,500
Sadly, I didn't come to touch you.

270
00:18:34,458 --> 00:18:37,417
Why else are you here?

271
00:18:37,417 --> 00:18:39,500
I came to defeat you.

272
00:18:40,292 --> 00:18:43,375
What a joke. You want to defeat me?

273
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:46,917
How can you possibly do that?

274
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:48,750
Is Yuri fine?

275
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:52,500
I'm treating her. She won't die.

276
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,125
Don't you think you can take her away.

277
00:18:54,125 --> 00:18:56,667
I don't mind keeping her.

278
00:18:56,667 --> 00:19:01,125
But the children you affected
because of the fight have nothing to do with me.

279
00:19:01,125 --> 00:19:03,417
Don't ignore me.

280
00:19:03,417 --> 00:19:06,083
Hey, Natsume. Long time no see.

281
00:19:06,083 --> 00:19:07,750
What? Who are you?

282
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:10,792
It's me. Kagawa Kunihiko.

283
00:19:10,792 --> 00:19:14,750
Kagawa Kunihiko? Kagawa?

284
00:19:15,708 --> 00:19:17,208
Is he pretending?

285
00:19:17,208 --> 00:19:20,458
Doesn't look like it. He doesn't look right.

286
00:19:20,458 --> 00:19:23,375
Could he have forgotten?

287
00:19:23,375 --> 00:19:24,958
Whoever you are,

288
00:19:24,958 --> 00:19:27,958
I'm here for Shun and Oka.

289
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:29,458
Outsiders please keep quiet.

290
00:19:29,458 --> 00:19:30,958
You said I'm an outsider?

291
00:19:30,958 --> 00:19:32,875
It seems you don't plan to retreat.

292
00:19:32,875 --> 00:19:36,958
Of course. I want to defeat you here.

293
00:19:36,958 --> 00:19:42,333
I will drag Oka and run until she
start crying and begging. I want you to suffer.

294
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:44,500
I get it.

295
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:47,292
Hold on a second.

296
00:19:47,292 --> 00:19:54,000
I will deal with Hugo myself.
Don't you interrupt.

297
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,917
I don't care.

298
00:19:55,917 --> 00:19:57,333
Shun.

299
00:19:57,333 --> 00:19:59,333
Anna, please treat the teacher.

300
00:19:59,333 --> 00:20:00,625
Hold on.

301
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:02,917
Teacher.

302
00:20:02,917 --> 00:20:05,583
This is not your problem only.

303
00:20:05,583 --> 00:20:10,875
Just like you. I have to have an end with Hugo.

304
00:20:10,875 --> 00:20:13,083
I shall hand teacher and Anna to you.

305
00:20:13,708 --> 00:20:16,625
Sophia, don't interrupt.

306
00:20:16,625 --> 00:20:18,208
Again?

307
00:20:18,208 --> 00:20:21,333
Even if you die this time, I won't save you.

308
00:20:21,333 --> 00:20:24,542
So be it. All of you go to the front line.

309
00:20:24,542 --> 00:20:25,583
But...

310
00:20:25,583 --> 00:20:27,542
You're in my way.

311
00:20:27,542 --> 00:20:30,833
Cut the crap and kill all the elves.

312
00:20:30,833 --> 00:20:32,458
Roger.

313
00:20:32,458 --> 00:20:35,000
All of you too. Please don't interrupt.

314
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,458
Uncoordinated ability values.

315
00:20:39,458 --> 00:20:44,042
Although the overall ability values are low,
there are many skills.

316
00:20:44,042 --> 00:20:48,333
This is the strength Hugo collected via Avarice.

317
00:20:48,333 --> 00:20:52,708
Some powerful skills must
have been obtained through the title.

318
00:20:52,708 --> 00:20:55,375
What's concerning is Devil's skills.

319
00:20:55,375 --> 00:21:02,167
Yes. The skills of Devil and Warrior can
obtain many skill points and proficiency.

320
00:21:02,167 --> 00:21:08,125
I don't think the self-proclaimed Warrior,
Hugo, will get Devil's skills intentionally.

321
00:21:08,125 --> 00:21:10,750
So did he get it via the proficiency?

322
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:17,292
I don't know how he accumulated proficiency,
but he did it.

323
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:25,250
He increased his ability value
with Warfare Magic and Divinity Magic?

324
00:21:26,083 --> 00:21:31,000
You have no way to turn back.

325
00:21:32,667 --> 00:21:33,542
I'm coming!

326
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:35,083

The two who have been competing for a long time,

346
00:23:27,083 --> 00:23:30,333
who will get the victory?

347
00:23:30,333 --> 00:23:32,000
Or...

348
00:23:36,333 --> 00:23:41,458

NEXT EPISODE: FRIENDS, WHY? STAY TUNED
