1
00:00:03,417 --> 00:00:06,250
When did I fall asleep?

2
00:00:06,958 --> 00:00:09,625
Miss Voice-from-the-Sky.

3
00:00:09,625 --> 00:00:13,750
You should have told me that
I would lose conscious during evolution.

4
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:17,125
Is the evolution over?

5
00:00:17,125 --> 00:00:21,167
But it seems my appearance hasn't changed much.

6
00:00:21,167 --> 00:00:23,000
I should identify now.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
SMALL TARATECT. NAMELESS.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,458
The species name has changed.
I think it was successful.

9
00:00:28,458 --> 00:00:29,958
"LEVEL ONE: WEAK"
But...

10
00:00:29,958 --> 00:00:31,792
Level one?

11
00:00:31,792 --> 00:00:35,292
That means I have to start from level one again
once I've evolved?

12
00:00:35,292 --> 00:00:38,333
My stamina is almost up.

13
00:00:38,333 --> 00:00:40,042
That's the reason.

14
00:00:40,042 --> 00:00:44,167
I have been feeling tired and hungry
since just now.

15
00:00:49,958 --> 00:00:53,750
I'm so hungry yet this is so nasty.

16
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:56,625
But I must recover first.

17
00:00:56,625 --> 00:00:59,042
I want to eat. I want to eat it.

18
00:00:59,042 --> 00:01:01,292
In order to survive.

19
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:10,375
I eat very little in my previous life.

20
00:01:10,375 --> 00:01:13,500
And now I have to be a greedy eater.

21
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,042
If I were to join an eating competition now,

22
00:01:16,042 --> 00:01:17,792
I will surely win.

23
00:01:17,792 --> 00:01:19,708
I still can eat.

24
00:01:22,125 --> 00:01:26,125
Seriously?
I'm just 80% full after eating so much.

25
00:01:26,125 --> 00:01:28,167
Evolution is tiring.

26
00:01:28,167 --> 00:01:31,042
Okay. Since I've done eating,

27
00:01:31,042 --> 00:01:33,250
I have no reason to keep staying here.

28
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:36,542
I shall step onto the next journey to find prey.

29
00:01:36,542 --> 00:01:39,125
I have slept and eaten enough.

30
00:01:42,375 --> 00:01:45,042
Thank you for letting me recover for now.

31
00:01:45,042 --> 00:01:46,292
I shall go now.

32
00:01:46,292 --> 00:01:47,583
Goodbye.

33
00:01:48,083 --> 00:01:52,125

SO I'M A SPIDER, SO WHAT?

58
00:03:18,208 --> 00:03:21,333
SILK CONTROL. INVESTIGATION.

59
00:03:21,333 --> 00:03:24,917
These are the only two skills I can have now.

60
00:03:24,917 --> 00:03:28,958
Silk control is about
controlling silks, I supposed?

61
00:03:29,667 --> 00:03:33,625
It's an essential for me
whose main force is the spider silks.

62
00:03:33,625 --> 00:03:37,500
If I can improve my silk control skill,

63
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,750
one day...

64
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:40,833
I can also be like my good neighbour
in New York.

65
00:03:40,833 --> 00:03:43,958
Using my spider silks gracefully.

66
00:03:44,875 --> 00:03:46,500
And this one...

67
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,083
This is the one, investigation.

68
00:03:48,083 --> 00:03:49,875
I can find out the existence of enemies
in advance.

69
00:03:49,875 --> 00:03:51,792
It's an important strategy skill.

70
00:03:51,792 --> 00:03:55,125
Okay. I want both of them.

71
00:03:55,125 --> 00:03:58,875
Please obtain the silk control
and investigation skills with your points.

72
00:03:58,875 --> 00:04:03,292
Great! Let's start investigating.

73
00:04:05,083 --> 00:04:08,500
It hurts! What's going on?

74
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:11,125
It hurts! My head is exploding!

75
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:12,958
Stop it now!

76
00:04:14,458 --> 00:04:18,041
What's with this horrible headache?

77
00:04:18,041 --> 00:04:19,124
I have decided

78
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:20,291
that the investigation skill

79
00:04:20,291 --> 00:04:22,375
shall be permanently sealed temporarily.

80
00:04:22,375 --> 00:04:23,458
Okay, next!

81
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:25,917
Silk controlling skill.

82
00:04:27,083 --> 00:04:29,833
Wow, the silks move so quickly.

83
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:32,833
If I keep improving this skill,

84
00:04:32,833 --> 00:04:35,542
I can surely have more uses of it.

85
00:04:36,375 --> 00:04:39,000
A spider-silk protective suit
or something similar.

86
00:04:42,208 --> 00:04:44,292
My dreams become bigger.

87
00:04:47,083 --> 00:04:48,458
Enemy.

88
00:04:49,292 --> 00:04:50,500
Jump!

89
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,875
Is my enemy there?

90
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:53,417
I lied to you!

91
00:04:55,125 --> 00:04:58,917
Upgrade from level one to two.

92
00:04:58,917 --> 00:05:00,333
Hooray!

93
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:02,958
Proficiency achieved a certain level.

94
00:05:02,958 --> 00:05:06,750
Identification skill upgraded to level six.

95
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:09,208
Identification skill is upgraded.

96
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:11,917
Assuming the upper limit of the level is ten,

97
00:05:11,917 --> 00:05:14,958
there must surely be a lot of useful functions.

98
00:05:14,958 --> 00:05:15,958
I assume.

99
00:05:21,042 --> 00:05:22,958
Miss Identification, tell me.

100
00:05:22,958 --> 00:05:27,000
LEVEL TWO SMALL TARATECT. NAMELESS.

101
00:05:27,458 --> 00:05:28,958
What is this? Great!

102
00:05:28,958 --> 00:05:32,208
The speed shows 348. This is awesome!

103
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:35,333
This must be the so-called ability values.

104
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:39,917
It should be.
I can finally see the ability values.

105
00:05:42,958 --> 00:05:46,208
I must find something to eat first.

106
00:05:46,208 --> 00:05:48,958
Level upgrade is awesome.

107
00:05:48,958 --> 00:05:53,125
These monsters are no longer my opponent.

108
00:05:53,125 --> 00:05:55,458
Those in front of me are not my enemy.

109
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:02,208
I have a bad hunch.

110
00:06:04,375 --> 00:06:06,792
It's not in front of me, it's behind!

111
00:06:06,792 --> 00:06:11,000
And they obviously are coming for me.

112
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,042
But the evolved me

113
00:06:13,042 --> 00:06:15,333
won't be defeated so easily.

114
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:16,708
First, identify.

115
00:06:16,708 --> 00:06:20,458
"HUMAN. LEVEL 29. NAME: GORDON."
Human. Level 29. Named Gordon.

116
00:06:20,458 --> 00:06:23,333
"FAIL TO IDENTIFY ABILITY VALUES"
Fail to identify ability values.

117
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:25,083
How can I beat them, silly?

118
00:06:25,083 --> 00:06:29,708
They're level 29.
There's no way I can beat them.

119
00:06:31,125 --> 00:06:32,292
Seriously?

120
00:06:32,292 --> 00:06:35,000
Such a sudden encounter. How can I beat them?

121
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,167
There's a snake ahead and humans behind.

122
00:06:37,167 --> 00:06:39,542
How can I take such attacks from both sides?

123
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:43,375
Why are they chasing me?

124
00:06:43,375 --> 00:06:46,750
My speed is 348.

125
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:48,750
They're so quick. Oh no!

126
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:51,292
Humans are scarier than I thought.

127
00:06:51,292 --> 00:06:53,625
Help me!

128
00:06:55,125 --> 00:06:58,542
And there are three monsters at such moment.

129
00:06:58,542 --> 00:07:01,875
I have no way to run at all.

130
00:07:01,875 --> 00:07:05,792
What should I do? I have no time to hesitate.

131
00:07:05,792 --> 00:07:08,000
Just give it a go.

132
00:07:11,458 --> 00:07:13,333
Success! I have succeeded.

133
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:15,333
This is the sudden explosive force when fleeing.

134
00:07:15,333 --> 00:07:17,750
The best trick, rock climbing, has succeeded.

135
00:07:21,792 --> 00:07:23,458
What's going on?

136
00:07:23,458 --> 00:07:24,792
Although I don't know what's going on,

137
00:07:24,792 --> 00:07:27,667
I'm sorry, three passer-by monsters.

138
00:07:27,667 --> 00:07:30,250
This is the fate of survival of the fittest.

139
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:33,458
You must be sacrificed in my place.

140
00:07:33,458 --> 00:07:36,375
I will pray for you. Weird.

141
00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:40,000
Hold on. I can't stop.

142
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:48,375
Here you go.

143
00:07:48,375 --> 00:07:50,500
Sorry, brother.

144
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:53,042
Sue, you're learning so seriously. Impressive.

145
00:07:53,042 --> 00:07:54,958
Yes, brother.

146
00:07:57,083 --> 00:07:58,792
I'm so sleepy.

147
00:08:06,167 --> 00:08:09,083
Excuse me, that's my seat.

148
00:08:09,083 --> 00:08:13,208
History and theory of magic and so on. I really
can't listen to these boring things anymore.

149
00:08:13,208 --> 00:08:16,000
Sorry. There's an empty seat over there.

150
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,792
But that's my seat.

151
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:22,583
Natsume...

152
00:08:22,583 --> 00:08:26,083
He's exactly like how he was
in the previous life.

153
00:08:26,083 --> 00:08:27,750
I can't stand him.

154
00:08:29,167 --> 00:08:30,750
Everyone, please take your sword

155
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:33,957
and gather at the forest in the west.

156
00:08:33,957 --> 00:08:35,957
Isn't this class about
the introduction to magic?

157
00:08:35,957 --> 00:08:38,791
It seems there's a practical lesson today.

158
00:08:38,792 --> 00:08:40,500
That's only right.

159
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:44,792
We won't know our true strength
without practical fights.

160
00:08:49,708 --> 00:08:52,625
It seems he sees you as his opponent.

161
00:08:52,625 --> 00:08:54,000
I guess so.

162
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,375
What's going on?

163
00:08:55,375 --> 00:08:56,875
No, nothing.

164
00:08:56,875 --> 00:09:00,917
If you have any trouble,
you should listen to the sound of God.

165
00:09:00,917 --> 00:09:01,500
What?

166
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:04,500
I heard the sound of God this morning too.

167
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,875
Once the level is upgraded,

168
00:09:05,875 --> 00:09:07,833
I can surely hear the sound of God
day and night.

169
00:09:07,833 --> 00:09:09,417
Let's go.

170
00:09:09,417 --> 00:09:12,375
The forest in the west
is quite some distance from here.

171
00:09:12,375 --> 00:09:14,292
Here, your sword.

172
00:09:15,208 --> 00:09:17,750
I think she has gone through a lot as well.

173
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:20,542
Didn't hesitate to comfort brother.

174
00:09:39,458 --> 00:09:41,792
You're a prince indeed.

175
00:09:41,792 --> 00:09:45,167
It's unlike the school supplies.
What a stylish sword.

176
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:49,417
Your sword is very stylish too, Hugo.

177
00:09:49,417 --> 00:09:53,542
However, the inner beauty is
more important than the outer.

178
00:09:53,542 --> 00:09:54,917
Yamada.

179
00:09:56,208 --> 00:09:59,333
He's Schlain Zagan Analeit,

180
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:01,750
the prince of the Kingdom of Analeit.

181
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:06,917
That was rude of me, Prince Schlain.

182
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:10,833
How dare you be so rude to my brother?

183
00:10:10,833 --> 00:10:12,083
Sue.

184
00:10:14,708 --> 00:10:16,167
Natsume...

185
00:10:16,167 --> 00:10:18,458
It's Hugo Baint Renxandt.

186
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:20,292
That's the right name, Your Highness.

187
00:10:20,292 --> 00:10:21,917
There are people watching here.

188
00:10:21,917 --> 00:10:24,458
You should call him by his name here.

189
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:26,250
Okay, sorry.

190
00:10:27,667 --> 00:10:31,625
Everyone, please get a magic wand each.

191
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:37,708
We're going to use
the magic wands we just distributed

192
00:10:37,708 --> 00:10:39,458
to carry out the practical class.

193
00:10:39,458 --> 00:10:41,083
For safety reasons,

194
00:10:41,083 --> 00:10:44,583
we're using magic wands filled with Water Magic.

195
00:10:44,583 --> 00:10:45,917
Water?

196
00:10:45,917 --> 00:10:48,917
To have the ability of magic induction
and magic control.

197
00:10:48,917 --> 00:10:49,417
Yes.

198
00:10:49,417 --> 00:10:51,542
Focus your magic power

199
00:10:51,542 --> 00:10:53,917
and focus it on the magic wand.

200
00:10:59,667 --> 00:11:03,625
Each one of you shoot a water bomb
towards the target.

201
00:11:03,625 --> 00:11:06,625
Remember, never target others.

202
00:11:13,833 --> 00:11:16,792
Please beware of how much
magic power you have left.

203
00:11:16,792 --> 00:11:19,500
I won't be responsible
if you faint trying to flaunt your superiority.

204
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:22,000
So irresponsible.

205
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,792
What was that?

206
00:11:27,792 --> 00:11:31,125
Fei, you scared everyone. Don't do that.

207
00:11:45,625 --> 00:11:49,125
You're just talking,
yet you didn't hit the target even once.

208
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:51,125
Water Magic?

209
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:54,708
I hope we could practise Earth Magic instead.

210
00:11:54,708 --> 00:11:56,083
Fei is an earth dragon.

211
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:58,167
You must be very good in Earth Magic.

212
00:11:58,167 --> 00:12:00,667
Even when I've practised very powerful magic,

213
00:12:00,667 --> 00:12:03,792
it will go to waste without usage.

214
00:12:03,792 --> 00:12:05,417
Don't worry.

215
00:12:05,417 --> 00:12:10,125
The school has magic tools that can be used
for all kinds of magic.

216
00:12:10,125 --> 00:12:12,583
I'm not good in using water,

217
00:12:12,583 --> 00:12:14,708
but better in using fire.

218
00:12:14,708 --> 00:12:19,667
What a coincidence.
I'm better in using fire than water as well.

219
00:12:19,667 --> 00:12:23,667
Level upgrade...

220
00:12:23,667 --> 00:12:26,292
Is it okay for her to shoot like that?

221
00:12:26,292 --> 00:12:27,750
Alright, Oka...

222
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:30,917
Oh no, Filimøs isn't here again?

223
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:33,708
Yes. She's always absent in class.

224
00:12:33,708 --> 00:12:35,250
I wonder what she's doing.

225
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:37,333
She'll just ignore me if I ask.

226
00:12:37,333 --> 00:12:40,458
Out of energy? You have no perseverance.

227
00:12:41,292 --> 00:12:44,000
Sue, are you not going to practise?

228
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,250
Seeing how these trash are astonished
by your perfect magic

229
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:52,375
and how they adore you is my happiest moment.

230
00:12:52,375 --> 00:12:54,542
I will practise secretly later.

231
00:12:56,625 --> 00:12:59,042
Level upgrade...

232
00:12:59,042 --> 00:13:00,958
In order to hear the sound of God.

233
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:02,417
Level upgrade...

234
00:13:02,417 --> 00:13:05,042
-She's working very hard to upgrade her level.
-Level upgrade...

235
00:13:05,042 --> 00:13:05,583
Look at her.

236
00:13:05,583 --> 00:13:09,125
Brother, so powerful. Crack shot.

237
00:13:09,125 --> 00:13:13,583
She's good in Light and Water Magic after all.

238
00:13:13,583 --> 00:13:16,125
Brother is perfect.

239
00:13:16,708 --> 00:13:20,542
I don't have to practise magic
that I'm not good at.

240
00:13:21,292 --> 00:13:25,083
It's more efficient to practise the field
that I'm good in.

241
00:13:33,583 --> 00:13:37,000
That fellow has obtained
the skill of Fire Magic?

242
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,833
Magic is only useful at such level.

243
00:13:41,833 --> 00:13:44,458
I can't upgrade my level anymore.

244
00:13:44,458 --> 00:13:48,750
This is the best time to show your strength.

245
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:51,583
But he has gone too far.

246
00:13:58,458 --> 00:14:00,375
I admit that you have actual strength.

247
00:14:00,375 --> 00:14:04,000
But showing off like that is not praise-worthy.

248
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,208
Hugo.

249
00:14:05,208 --> 00:14:06,750
Is that so?

250
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:10,083
This is not a battlefield.
This is the learning field of the school.

251
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:11,792
Pick up your magic wand.

252
00:14:12,625 --> 00:14:16,292
Who knows when this will
turn into a battlefield?

253
00:14:16,792 --> 00:14:18,125
This guy...

254
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:20,458
He's exactly like
how he was in the previous life.

255
00:14:20,458 --> 00:14:23,000
He's even worse than before.

256
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:26,583
What's going on?

257
00:14:26,583 --> 00:14:29,417
Didn't you hear that?

258
00:14:31,417 --> 00:14:32,750
What?

259
00:14:53,708 --> 00:14:55,250
Retreat!

260
00:14:58,083 --> 00:14:59,375
Teacher!

261
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,083
It's coming.

262
00:15:27,542 --> 00:15:29,083
It's earth dragon.

263
00:15:31,208 --> 00:15:32,583
Awesome!

264
00:15:32,583 --> 00:15:35,458
It's finally my time to perform.

265
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:36,792
Watch!

266
00:15:36,792 --> 00:15:40,208
I can deal with this fellow easily
with my power.

267
00:15:40,208 --> 00:15:42,000
No! Come back!

268
00:15:47,958 --> 00:15:50,250
I'll burn you down.

269
00:15:52,875 --> 00:15:54,083
What?

270
00:15:56,458 --> 00:15:58,542
It neutralised magic.

271
00:15:58,542 --> 00:16:00,208
It's the skill of a imperial wrath.

272
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:01,958
Are you kidding me?

273
00:16:01,958 --> 00:16:03,792
Another strike!

274
00:16:07,792 --> 00:16:09,208
Hugo!

275
00:16:13,542 --> 00:16:15,125
Killed?

276
00:16:15,125 --> 00:16:18,542
Is this death?

277
00:16:24,125 --> 00:16:25,625
Julius.

278
00:16:25,625 --> 00:16:27,000
Brother.

279
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:32,333
At such moment, Brother Julius

280
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,625
will surely fight bravely!

281
00:16:38,167 --> 00:16:39,708
Brother.

282
00:16:40,542 --> 00:16:42,083
Shun.

283
00:16:43,875 --> 00:16:45,875
We'll all die if this goes on.

284
00:16:45,875 --> 00:16:48,167
Fei, take care of Sue.

285
00:16:48,167 --> 00:16:49,333
Shun.

286
00:16:49,333 --> 00:16:51,000
Katia. Yuri.

287
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,875
There's no other way.

288
00:16:52,875 --> 00:16:55,958
God would want us to fight together.

289
00:16:55,958 --> 00:16:57,292
Brother.

290
00:16:57,292 --> 00:16:58,625
Sue, retreat!

291
00:16:58,625 --> 00:17:00,917
Hold on! Stop!

292
00:17:02,417 --> 00:17:03,458
Don't come along.

293
00:17:03,458 --> 00:17:04,291
No.

294
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:05,749
I want to come with you.

295
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:07,208
Run!

296
00:17:13,958 --> 00:17:15,958
Good. Sue, Yuri.

297
00:17:15,958 --> 00:17:17,416
Cooperate with me.

298
00:17:17,416 --> 00:17:18,749
Okay.

299
00:17:30,958 --> 00:17:32,792
Bres, retreat.

300
00:17:32,792 --> 00:17:34,833
Those behind us will be hit if you keep going.

301
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:37,000
Magic power.

302
00:17:37,833 --> 00:17:39,042
Air power.

303
00:17:39,833 --> 00:17:41,417
Magic of Light?

304
00:17:43,125 --> 00:17:45,208
Brother!

305
00:17:48,625 --> 00:17:50,458
Get off!

306
00:17:50,458 --> 00:17:52,875
Stop! You may hit Sue and the rest.

307
00:17:52,875 --> 00:17:54,875
That's why I told you to get off.

308
00:17:54,875 --> 00:17:56,333
You silly!

309
00:18:00,542 --> 00:18:01,917
Oh my.

310
00:18:01,917 --> 00:18:03,542
A bunch of overconfident lads.

311
00:18:09,208 --> 00:18:10,417
Fei.

312
00:18:32,167 --> 00:18:33,542
Brother.

313
00:18:33,542 --> 00:18:34,417
Are you okay?

314
00:18:34,417 --> 00:18:35,458
Are you injured?

315
00:18:35,458 --> 00:18:36,792
I'm fine.

316
00:18:41,417 --> 00:18:42,875
You saved us.

317
00:18:43,625 --> 00:18:45,625
Thank you, Fei.

318
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:50,417
Respond to everyone's cheering.

319
00:19:10,667 --> 00:19:15,250
It seems there's one person who's not grateful.

320
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:17,417
Fei, what's going on?

321
00:19:17,417 --> 00:19:19,625
Try identifying me.

322
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:20,750
Identify?

323
00:19:23,708 --> 00:19:26,083
CANNIBAL.

324
00:19:26,083 --> 00:19:28,833
Cannibal?

325
00:19:29,875 --> 00:19:31,417
Seriously?

326
00:19:31,417 --> 00:19:34,208
Just like what you thought.

327
00:19:34,208 --> 00:19:38,000
This is your parent?

328
00:19:44,042 --> 00:19:45,667
Brother.

329
00:19:45,667 --> 00:19:46,875
-Shun.
-Are you alright?

330
00:19:46,875 --> 00:19:48,208
-Shun.
-Brother.

331
00:19:48,208 --> 00:19:49,583
-Come on, Shun.
-Brother, get up.

332
00:19:49,583 --> 00:19:50,375
Shun.

333
00:19:50,375 --> 00:19:52,292
-Shun.
-Brother.

334
00:19:56,083 --> 00:19:57,333
Do you know? This is the prelude.

335
00:19:57,333 --> 00:19:59,625
The life of a spider.

336
00:19:59,625 --> 00:20:01,208
I'm going to start singing.

♫Bring it on♫

368
00:20:57,708 --> 00:20:59,000
♫I can do anything♫

369
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,292
♫Just go on if there's no other way♫

370
00:21:00,292 --> 00:21:01,500
♫Use all kind of skills♫

371
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:04,000
♫I don't care even if I'm destroyed♫

372
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,250
♫I don't want to die♫

373
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:06,500
♫I want to live♫

374
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:07,750
♫I must keep living♫

375
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:09,083
♫Take this♫

376
00:21:09,083 --> 00:21:10,292
♫I don't want horrible game life♫

377
00:21:10,292 --> 00:21:11,625
♫Life should be better after reincarnation♫

378
00:21:11,625 --> 00:21:12,917
♫Why is my beginning so miserable?♫

379
00:21:12,917 --> 00:21:14,125
♫I will not forgive you, admin D♫

380
00:21:14,125 --> 00:21:15,292
♫The big labyrinth is just as dark today♫

381
00:21:15,292 --> 00:21:16,458
♫Keep living or die trying♫

382
00:21:16,458 --> 00:21:17,708
♫Although this kind of life
is quite interesting♫

383
00:21:17,708 --> 00:21:19,458
♫I still can't accept why♫

384
00:21:19,458 --> 00:21:22,333
♫I am a spider♫

385
00:21:26,167 --> 00:21:29,917
Silk... Spider silk, come out quickly.

386
00:21:35,667 --> 00:21:38,542
Although I didn't fall to death, it still hurt.

387
00:21:38,542 --> 00:21:41,417
This is the punishment of being on cloud nine.

388
00:21:41,417 --> 00:21:43,750
Okay, I'll reflect on myself.

389
00:21:46,417 --> 00:21:48,667
I said, I will reflect on myself.
Why are there more things coming?

390
00:21:48,667 --> 00:21:49,542
FINJICOTE. LEVEL FIVE.

391
00:21:49,542 --> 00:21:51,583
Don't look my way. Let me go.

392
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:54,667
Sorry.

393
00:21:54,667 --> 00:21:55,708
Landed.

394
00:21:56,542 --> 00:21:58,583
Oh no...

395
00:21:58,583 --> 00:22:01,667
The situation is bad right now.

396
00:22:01,667 --> 00:22:03,042
What's going on now?

397
00:22:03,042 --> 00:22:05,000
It feels like there's one disaster
after another.

398
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,500
I have a bad hunch.

399
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:10,000
Snake.

400
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,625
And there are three of them.

401
00:22:11,625 --> 00:22:14,167
I'm in trouble.

402
00:22:14,167 --> 00:22:17,042
It would be horrible
if I were in a pincer attack again.

403
00:22:22,417 --> 00:22:23,875
Great!

404
00:22:23,875 --> 00:22:26,125
They're enjoying the baits.

405
00:22:26,125 --> 00:22:28,167
I should take this chance to run.

406
00:22:28,167 --> 00:22:30,792
What should this situation be called?

407
00:22:30,792 --> 00:22:32,000
The third party is profited.

408
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,417
You can't have it all.

409
00:22:34,417 --> 00:22:35,833
They're both not right.

410
00:22:35,833 --> 00:22:38,792
Whatever it is, as long as they don't find me.

411
00:22:39,375 --> 00:22:42,375
The fight of monsters.

412
00:22:42,375 --> 00:22:44,917
"THE FIGHT OF MONSTERS"
Now it's the chance to run!

413
00:22:50,458 --> 00:22:54,083
"ARABA EARTH DRAGON LEVEL 31"
What is this?

414
00:23:17,042 --> 00:23:18,333
What?

415
00:23:18,333 --> 00:23:20,083
What is that?

416
00:23:22,583 --> 00:23:23,625
Oh no!

417
00:23:23,625 --> 00:23:27,083
Oh no, run...

418
00:23:35,042 --> 00:23:36,292
Oh no!

419
00:23:36,292 --> 00:23:39,000
SO I'M A SPIDER, SO WHAT?
NEXT EPISODE: MONKEY, HOAR?

420
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,458
STAY TUNED
