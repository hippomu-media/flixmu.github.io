00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:28,750
Fei.

46
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,000
Seriously?

47
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,250
Sorry.

48
00:02:34,875 --> 00:02:38,208
You've left school for almost a month, right?

49
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:40,167
Yes.

50
00:02:40,167 --> 00:02:44,333
The people still don't know about your brother.

51
00:02:45,958 --> 00:02:52,250
Your brothers gave the league of Demon Clan
a big blow. They can't do anything for now.

52
00:02:53,458 --> 00:02:57,208
Is Hyrince coming back to the country soon?

53
00:02:57,208 --> 00:03:00,250
He's the only survivor of the Warrior team.

54
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:04,833
What happened to your brother?
What kind of enemy was that?

55
00:03:04,833 --> 00:03:07,333
He will surely tell you.

56
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:11,375
After all, as the Warrior,
you have to fight against those people.

57
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:14,500
The Warrior?

58
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,375
What's wrong?

59
00:03:16,375 --> 00:03:20,625
I feel uneasy
taking over Brother Julius' position.

60
00:03:20,625 --> 00:03:25,625
Unlike before, I can no longer
be in battles with Sue nor Katia.

61
00:03:25,625 --> 00:03:30,750
But Yuri is assigned as the Saint,
she might come with me.

62
00:03:33,292 --> 00:03:34,375
I think,

63
00:03:35,208 --> 00:03:37,042
you should make a contract with me.

64
00:03:37,042 --> 00:03:38,083
What?

65
00:03:38,083 --> 00:03:40,000
What do you mean?

66
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,167
Isn't it convenient
if you can summon me anytime?

67
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:50,750
But I want to be on an equal footing with you.

68
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:55,292
Besides, after signing a contract,
I can summon you forcefully.

69
00:03:55,292 --> 00:03:56,958
Is that okay as well?

70
00:03:56,958 --> 00:04:00,292
If it weren't an emergency,
you wouldn't do that, right?

71
00:04:00,292 --> 00:04:02,917
That's right.

72
00:04:02,917 --> 00:04:07,292
When you're in danger,
you can summon me immediately.

73
00:04:07,292 --> 00:04:11,792
Will you be less worried like that?

74
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:13,833
Thank you.

75
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:17,250
But how should we make a contract?

76
00:04:19,875 --> 00:04:22,000
Fei, give me your hand.

77
00:04:22,708 --> 00:04:24,000
Like this?

78
00:04:37,792 --> 00:04:41,083
Okay, the contract is made.

79
00:04:41,083 --> 00:04:43,458
That's it?

80
00:04:43,458 --> 00:04:46,083
Turns out it can be done so easily.

81
00:04:46,083 --> 00:04:50,833
It's easy to make a contract
but it's hard to rescind it.

82
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:53,125
Really?

83
00:04:53,125 --> 00:04:54,375
Fei.

84
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:56,458
What's going on?

85
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:05,250
Fei?

86
00:05:07,417 --> 00:05:08,708
EVOLUTION IN PROGRESS

87
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:10,208
Evolution?

88
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:13,792
My mood is terrible.

89
00:05:13,792 --> 00:05:16,667
What make me so irritated is...

90
00:05:16,667 --> 00:05:17,958
LEVEL 10 FORBIDDEN SKILL

91
00:05:17,958 --> 00:05:20,208
Forbidden skill...

92
00:05:20,208 --> 00:05:25,417
Perhaps to people in this world, it's forbidden.

93
00:05:25,417 --> 00:05:27,083
After knowing this,

94
00:05:28,083 --> 00:05:34,250
and when the forbidden skill is upgraded
to level 10, much information was downloaded.

95
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:36,250
The origin of this world.

96
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:37,917
Things happened in the past.

97
00:05:37,917 --> 00:05:40,667
The secret of skills and ability values.

98
00:05:40,667 --> 00:05:45,917
To be honest,
my brain can't understand all the information.

99
00:05:45,917 --> 00:05:51,375
The person in charge of information is
processing and interpreting it slowly.

100
00:05:51,375 --> 00:05:56,000
There's one thing for sure,

101
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,458
which is...

102
00:05:57,458 --> 00:06:02,333
This world is destined to perish
if it continues like this.

103
00:06:07,042 --> 00:06:11,125
Since I know about this,
I can't just await death here.

104
00:06:11,125 --> 00:06:12,542
I must figure a way out.

105
00:06:12,542 --> 00:06:14,083
That's right.

106
00:06:14,083 --> 00:06:17,208
I don't want to die with the perishing world.

107
00:06:17,208 --> 00:06:20,042
It will be annoying
if I can no longer eat delicious food.

108
00:06:20,833 --> 00:06:25,083
In that case, I shall then improve
my skills to make myself stronger.

109
00:06:25,083 --> 00:06:30,167
Even if we become stronger,
we can't stop the world from perishing.

110
00:06:30,167 --> 00:06:33,000
Even the admins can't do that.

111
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,375
I don't know.

112
00:06:34,375 --> 00:06:38,167
But all we can do now is to make us stronger.

113
00:06:38,167 --> 00:06:42,875
If anything happens,
we can't do anything without strengths.

114
00:06:42,875 --> 00:06:44,000
Indeed.

115
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,375
If we want to defeat enemies in this world,
we must be strong.

116
00:06:47,375 --> 00:06:50,708
Hence the next one we must defeat is...

117
00:06:52,417 --> 00:06:54,417
the earth dragon, Araba.

118
00:06:58,542 --> 00:07:00,333
Don't be afraid!

119
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:02,958
You want to challenge that monster?
Are you insane?

120
00:07:02,958 --> 00:07:04,375
Yes.

121
00:07:04,375 --> 00:07:06,375
You silly ones!

122
00:07:07,042 --> 00:07:08,792
What are you doing?

123
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:14,875
Do you think I want to fight it?

124
00:07:14,875 --> 00:07:16,833
What do you mean?

125
00:07:16,833 --> 00:07:19,375
How long are you going to turn a blind eye?

126
00:07:19,375 --> 00:07:22,917
Don't you want to
overcome the psychological trauma?

127
00:07:22,917 --> 00:07:25,458
We would like to overcome it if we can.

128
00:07:25,458 --> 00:07:28,458
It's called a psychological trauma
because it's hard to overcome.

129
00:07:28,458 --> 00:07:29,292
Right?

130
00:07:29,292 --> 00:07:30,333
Yes.

131
00:07:31,917 --> 00:07:34,708
Alright. Listen to me, clones.

132
00:07:34,708 --> 00:07:38,083
If we can't even overcome
our psychological trauma,

133
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:43,292
how are we going to
save the world from this crisis?

134
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:49,917
You finally understood.

135
00:07:49,917 --> 00:07:53,125
So we've decided on what needs to be done.

136
00:07:53,125 --> 00:07:55,875
Defeat Araba!

137
00:07:57,333 --> 00:08:00,250
Now that it's decided,
let's investigate the enemy situation.

138
00:08:01,792 --> 00:08:03,542
Don't you be scared!

139
00:08:03,542 --> 00:08:04,958
"TELEPORT"
Go!

140
00:08:04,958 --> 00:08:07,167
I'm at the Lower Stratum now.

141
00:08:13,208 --> 00:08:14,500
What?

142
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,458
Not Araba.

143
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:20,542
So big!

144
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:25,333
"ELROE BARAGGISH. LEVEL 25"
It's big with intimidating ability values.

145
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:28,625
I will surely be killed by such an opponent.

146
00:08:28,625 --> 00:08:30,167
Please forgive me.

147
00:08:40,082 --> 00:08:45,917
There are monsters beyond
my imagination living in the Lower Stratum.

148
00:08:45,917 --> 00:08:49,125
The investigation of Araba has to be delayed.

149
00:08:52,292 --> 00:08:54,667
What? What was that?

150
00:08:54,667 --> 00:08:57,000
From the direction where the snake left...

151
00:08:59,417 --> 00:09:00,958
TELESCOPE

152
00:09:18,875 --> 00:09:21,125
It's Gravitational Magic.

153
00:09:38,667 --> 00:09:42,750
From now on, it's no longer a battle.

154
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:50,375
The powerful snake is violently ravaged
by an even more powerful dragon.

155
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:59,500
I think this scene
of overwhelming violence is beautiful.

156
00:10:01,583 --> 00:10:06,667
I'm longing for
the powerful strength of the dragon.

157
00:10:24,167 --> 00:10:28,708
It's what I have to surpass.

158
00:10:29,375 --> 00:10:32,000
Earth Dragon Araba.

159
00:10:45,667 --> 00:10:48,458
Sorry for the wait.

160
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:52,417
Don't be. Long time no see, Brother Hyrince.

161
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:57,042
Shun, I'm sorry.

162
00:11:01,958 --> 00:11:07,167
Julius should have survived instead of me.

163
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:09,833
What do you mean?

164
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:16,625
This is...

165
00:11:16,625 --> 00:11:23,958
This is the feather of Immortal Bird
that can help the holder to escape death once.

166
00:11:23,958 --> 00:11:28,875
Julius, as the Warrior, should have had it.

167
00:11:28,875 --> 00:11:33,833
But he said, I who in charge
of defense should take it instead.

168
00:11:33,833 --> 00:11:35,750
He gave it to me.

169
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:37,458
That means...

170
00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:42,875
I could survive because of this tool.

171
00:11:42,875 --> 00:11:46,708
But he was the one who should have survived.

172
00:11:48,792 --> 00:11:51,667
Brother Hyrince, you don't have to apologise.

173
00:11:52,208 --> 00:11:55,625
Brother Julius insisted that you should take it.

174
00:11:58,208 --> 00:12:02,708
And said, "I will not die, so it's okay."

175
00:12:04,333 --> 00:12:06,833
We're brothers indeed.

176
00:12:06,833 --> 00:12:10,333
Please tell me
what happened before brother died.

177
00:12:14,375 --> 00:12:20,708
Julius was about to fight the enemy's general.
When he persuaded him to surrender,

178
00:12:20,708 --> 00:12:22,833
it appeared.

179
00:12:26,208 --> 00:12:27,708
A white...

180
00:12:27,708 --> 00:12:30,625
A completely white girl.

181
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:43,042
That's all I remember.

182
00:12:44,167 --> 00:12:49,000
When I was conscious again,
I realised I fell on the floor.

183
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:54,167
Judging from the situation,
I hadn't fainted for too long.

184
00:12:55,792 --> 00:13:00,083
But everything has ended at that moment.

185
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:10,667
This is brother's?

186
00:13:10,667 --> 00:13:14,875
I only know one possibility
that could cause that phenomenon.

187
00:13:14,875 --> 00:13:16,958
Which is corrosive attack.

188
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:19,208
Corrosive attack?

189
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:24,750
It's said to be a destruction property
that can control death.

190
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:30,250
When one is attacked by that move,
his body will turn into ash and die.

191
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:31,792
How could it...

192
00:13:33,333 --> 00:13:34,667
Sorry.

193
00:13:34,667 --> 00:13:37,125
This is the only thing I could bring back.

194
00:13:37,125 --> 00:13:42,042
No. Thank you very much.

195
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:46,417
Hello, nice to meet you.

196
00:13:46,417 --> 00:13:50,750
I'm your brother, Julius.

197
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:53,125
Despite looking so, I'm actually the Warrior.

198
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:58,083
Schlain, I heard you have
a girlfriend from the Duke's family.

199
00:13:58,083 --> 00:14:01,083
You two even have nicknames for each other.

200
00:14:01,083 --> 00:14:04,417
May I call you Shun as well?

201
00:14:04,917 --> 00:14:10,583
Warrior is the people's hope.
Hence I can't disappoint them.

202
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:11,917
Never.

203
00:14:12,792 --> 00:14:15,125
What's important is the aim.

204
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:21,167
To create a world with laughter and peace.
That's the dream I pursue.

205
00:14:22,583 --> 00:14:24,208
Until death stops me.

206
00:14:25,125 --> 00:14:30,167
I can't be an excellent Warrior
like Brother Julius.

207
00:14:31,625 --> 00:14:36,833
But I want to carry on his dream.

208
00:14:37,958 --> 00:14:41,667
Shun. No, Warrior Schlain.

209
00:14:42,458 --> 00:14:47,333
I couldn't protect Julius. Let me protect you.

210
00:14:49,542 --> 00:14:53,250
Thank you. Please guide me.

211
00:14:54,292 --> 00:14:59,583
I can only imitate Brother Julius
and be an impure Warrior.

212
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:02,083
But that's okay.

213
00:15:02,083 --> 00:15:05,792
That's my consciousness as Warrior.

214
00:15:07,458 --> 00:15:09,917
I want to upgrade.

215
00:15:15,167 --> 00:15:17,708
I can't defeat Araba now.

216
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:20,583
I must upgrade and draw up a battle plan.

217
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,625
Destruction Evil Eye!

218
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,792
Although I predicted it,
Destruction Evil Eye is a suicidal attack.

219
00:15:36,792 --> 00:15:37,375
CORROSION

220
00:15:37,375 --> 00:15:42,667
Destruction Evil Eye obtained together
with corrosive attack during evolution

221
00:15:42,667 --> 00:15:44,875
can't be used so easily.

222
00:15:46,583 --> 00:15:50,083
But it can be the killer attack at emergencies.

223
00:15:52,292 --> 00:15:54,625
Casting Healing Magic.

224
00:15:57,250 --> 00:16:00,208
Okay. Continue upgrading.

225
00:16:03,875 --> 00:16:06,625
EARTH DRAGON KAGNA. LEVEL 26.
EARTH DRAGON GEHRE. LEVEL 24.

226
00:16:06,625 --> 00:16:10,333
What? Earth dragon? Two of them?

227
00:16:10,333 --> 00:16:12,500
How can I defeat them? Retreat!

228
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:12,792
TELEPORT

229
00:16:12,792 --> 00:16:15,625
Earth dragons are scary.

230
00:16:15,625 --> 00:16:18,333
But I've made markings.

231
00:16:18,333 --> 00:16:19,667
"EARTH DRAGON GEHRE. EARTH DRAGON KAGNA"
As long as I've made markings,

232
00:16:19,667 --> 00:16:21,542
"EARTH DRAGON GEHRE. EARTH DRAGON KAGNA"
I know their whereabouts.

233
00:16:21,542 --> 00:16:23,667
I can even identify.

234
00:16:23,667 --> 00:16:26,792
I made markings on the humans last time.

235
00:16:26,792 --> 00:16:31,000
The target of those people
is outside the labyrinth.

236
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,625
As long as I catch up with them,
I can find the exit.

237
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:39,208
But before leaving the labyrinth,
let me deal with Araba first.

238
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:41,042
"EARTH DRAGON ARABA"
As long as the marking is made,

239
00:16:41,042 --> 00:16:43,500
"BEDROOM OF ARABA"
I can take the opportunity to attack it.

240
00:16:44,208 --> 00:16:45,792
Take this!

241
00:16:47,125 --> 00:16:51,500
Even if I have a great prank to wake it,
I can't actually defeat it.

242
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,667
Since I can't defeat it the right way,

243
00:16:53,667 --> 00:16:57,667
I shall just come up with
the wrong ways to defeat it.

244
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:02,125
Okay. I don't come here for anything else,

245
00:17:02,125 --> 00:17:06,833
but to destroy the chaotically-flying bees
who think this is their home.

246
00:17:06,833 --> 00:17:08,958
As for why...

247
00:17:08,958 --> 00:17:13,541
I'm going to fight Araba here.
These guys are in the way.

248
00:17:13,541 --> 00:17:19,749
When fighting Araba,
it's too risky to be on the ground.

249
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:26,458
Because it's very good in
magical attack and defense in narrow caves.

250
00:17:27,166 --> 00:17:32,792
If I keep being on the ground,
I have to be responsible of the risks.

251
00:17:32,792 --> 00:17:34,833
What should I do then?

252
00:17:35,458 --> 00:17:39,500
I can fly!

253
00:17:41,167 --> 00:17:44,333
Yes. I just have to keep being in the air.

254
00:17:44,333 --> 00:17:48,750
I won't touch the earthen spears
when I'm off the ground.

255
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:53,375
Even if I touch it,
I will have time to escape easily.

256
00:17:53,375 --> 00:17:57,625
The spitting can be avoided by
paying attention to the movement before attack.

257
00:17:59,125 --> 00:18:03,625
But first of all, the bees shouldn't disturb me.

258
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:08,083
Okay. Quickly chase them out...

259
00:18:08,083 --> 00:18:09,042
It hurts!

260
00:18:10,167 --> 00:18:12,792
Taratect's shoulder fall!

261
00:18:16,042 --> 00:18:17,333
What a scary fellow.

262
00:18:17,333 --> 00:18:22,500
It could sting me without
being detected by the identification skill.

263
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:25,958
If it were the old me, I would have been dead.

264
00:18:25,958 --> 00:18:28,167
But now, this is nothing.

265
00:18:28,833 --> 00:18:30,375
It hurts!

266
00:18:31,125 --> 00:18:33,708
Taratect's invincible hot wheels!

267
00:18:36,083 --> 00:18:42,042
Is it because these guys aren't dangerous enough
that's why they're not detectable?

268
00:18:42,833 --> 00:18:43,958
"FINJICOTE. LEVEL ONE."
Indeed.

269
00:18:43,958 --> 00:18:46,167
"FINJICOTE. LEVEL ONE."
They're food at most.

270
00:18:46,167 --> 00:18:49,375
Despite so, they're too annoying. Hurry up...

271
00:18:49,375 --> 00:18:50,875
It hurts!

272
00:18:51,833 --> 00:18:54,458
Enough is enough.

273
00:18:56,583 --> 00:19:00,625
Okay. Since you're provocative...

274
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:02,958
I'm going to start destroying.

275
00:19:03,792 --> 00:19:06,500
Activate Spatial Mechanism.

276
00:19:19,542 --> 00:19:20,875
Once again.

277
00:19:20,875 --> 00:19:23,375
Proficiency achieved a certain level.

278
00:19:23,375 --> 00:19:26,000
Magic of Wind is upgraded to level three.

279
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,083
Earth Magic is upgraded to level two.

280
00:19:29,083 --> 00:19:31,458
Two kinds of magic are upgraded.

281
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,750
There's no end to this.

282
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:35,500
If that's the case...

283
00:19:36,458 --> 00:19:38,333
Diablo Bullets!

284
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,792
Let's revise magic.

285
00:19:50,792 --> 00:19:52,208
Okay.

286
00:19:52,208 --> 00:19:56,708
The strongest magic I possess is Abyss Magic.

287
00:19:56,708 --> 00:20:01,583
But it's slow and tough to cast this magic.

288
00:20:01,583 --> 00:20:05,292
Compared to the speedy Araba,
we can't use this while fighting it.

289
00:20:06,833 --> 00:20:11,500
Next up, there are Magic of Wind
and Magic of Water that I copied.

290
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:21,500
Having Wisdom and Ultimate Magic, it's easy
for me to copy the enemies' killer move.

291
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:22,542
Amazing!

292
00:20:22,542 --> 00:20:25,542
After meeting Araba, I obtained Earth Magic.

293
00:20:27,208 --> 00:20:31,667
But since the level of the skill is too low,
it's useless against Araba.

294
00:20:32,958 --> 00:20:37,042
At this time, we have to use Black Magic.

295
00:20:37,917 --> 00:20:41,458
"SHADOW MAGIC. DARK MAGIC. BLACK MAGIC."
Unlike the magic learnt on the spot,

296
00:20:41,458 --> 00:20:46,708
this is a move with gradual increasing level
after obtaining Ultimate Magic.

297
00:20:46,708 --> 00:20:50,458
Although the magic can
only move shadows at the beginning,

298
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:53,625
it will become extremely
powerful after evolution.

299
00:20:53,625 --> 00:20:57,208
At the battle with Araba,
we will use Black Magic as the main force,

300
00:20:57,208 --> 00:21:00,875
in addition to Spatial Magic,
Gaido Magic and so on.

301
00:21:01,417 --> 00:21:04,000
That's all for today's class.

302
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,500
Thank you, everyone.

303
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:12,833
Look. Bees are like rubbish.

304
00:21:15,958 --> 00:21:18,500
It seems a new bee appeared.

305
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:23,000
"GENERAL FINJICOTE. LEVEL FOUR."
A creature with a higher rank than High Finjicote.

306
00:21:30,708 --> 00:21:33,417
"GAIDO MAGIC, DELUSION."
It's an after-image.

307
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:34,958
Just kidding.

308
00:21:36,167 --> 00:21:38,500
Bee swarm. That means...

309
00:21:39,917 --> 00:21:42,958
Is that the beehive? It's huge!

310
00:21:47,542 --> 00:21:49,792
Sorry for bothering you to protect it.

311
00:21:49,792 --> 00:21:52,917
Because it's too troublesome,
I have to destroy it in one go.

312
00:21:55,167 --> 00:21:56,875
Take this!

313
00:21:56,875 --> 00:21:59,875
Diablo Gun!

314
00:22:11,625 --> 00:22:14,500
Experience achieved a certain target.

315
00:22:15,542 --> 00:22:17,458
Landed safely.

316
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:24,542
It has finally ended.

317
00:22:24,542 --> 00:22:27,958
I thought there would be honey, but there isn't.

318
00:22:28,958 --> 00:22:30,667
Useless.

319
00:22:31,417 --> 00:22:35,875
Okay. Let's draw up a battle plan with Araba.

320
00:22:37,917 --> 00:22:41,167
Okay, I'm prepared.

321
00:22:41,167 --> 00:22:45,042
I'll use the skill points left
to redeem new skills.

322
00:22:45,042 --> 00:22:48,375
"LAZINESS"
I wonder if this can come in handy.

323
00:22:48,375 --> 00:22:50,917
I've done everything I can.

324
00:22:59,208 --> 00:23:00,333
Is it here?

325
00:23:02,917 --> 00:23:04,417
Wonderful.

326
00:23:04,417 --> 00:23:07,333
It's right to feel fear now.

327
00:23:08,083 --> 00:23:10,375
"EARTH DRAGON ARABA. LEVEL 32."
You're very strong.

328
00:23:10,375 --> 00:23:12,542
I'm very afraid.

329
00:23:12,542 --> 00:23:14,792
But I'm very happy.

330
00:23:14,792 --> 00:23:20,375
Your identification skill is so great,
you must have detected that I survived.

331
00:23:21,208 --> 00:23:24,875
When you noticed it,
you thought I'm an unimportant person.

332
00:23:24,875 --> 00:23:26,500
So you let me go.

333
00:23:27,917 --> 00:23:32,000
I will make you regret your arrogance.

334
00:23:33,875 --> 00:23:36,333
EDE SAINE. LEVEL 26. NAMELESS.

335
00:23:36,333 --> 00:23:39,000
SO I'M A SPIDER, SO WHAT?
NEXT EPISODE: MY BATTLE IS ABOUT TO BEGIN.

336
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,458
STAY TUNED
