1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:01,500
Perhaps it's too late to talk about this now.

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:03,958
My luck is really bad.

3
00:00:03,958 --> 00:00:07,458
I even think, God hates me.

4
00:00:07,458 --> 00:00:10,292
First,
I'm mysteriously reincarnated as a spider.

5
00:00:10,292 --> 00:00:14,792
Up until now, I've gone through many obstacles
in this ridiculous spider life.

6
00:00:14,792 --> 00:00:16,417
I've tried my best.

7
00:00:16,417 --> 00:00:18,292
But my struggle...

8
00:00:21,375 --> 00:00:24,792
shouldn't be repaid like this.

9
00:00:24,792 --> 00:00:28,000
It's hot! I can't stay here.

10
00:00:28,875 --> 00:00:30,625
My spider silk is on fire!

11
00:00:31,667 --> 00:00:33,083
It's on fire!

12
00:00:33,083 --> 00:00:34,208
Extinguish it!

13
00:00:34,208 --> 00:00:36,250
If not, just cut it off.

14
00:00:37,458 --> 00:00:41,250
I literally almost burnt my behind.

15
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:44,083
Something appears.

16
00:00:44,083 --> 00:00:46,083
I can see the ability value so quickly.

17
00:00:46,083 --> 00:00:48,000
I think my identification skill is upgraded.

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,250
It's so clear and written in such details.

19
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:51,375
This is useful.

20
00:00:51,375 --> 00:00:53,792
"ELROE GUNERUSH. LEVEL 7"
It can even swim in lava?

21
00:00:55,583 --> 00:00:56,667
"MIDDLE STRATUM OF GREAT ELROE LABYRINTH"
Seriously?

22
00:00:56,667 --> 00:00:57,917
"THIS IS A HOT TERRAIN AREA WITH FLOWING LAVA."
Fire resistance?

23
00:00:57,917 --> 00:00:59,042
INHABITED BY MANY FIRE-RESISTING MONSTERS.

24
00:01:00,042 --> 00:01:01,000
No!

25
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,958
It's despicable of them to hide in lava.

26
00:01:02,958 --> 00:01:04,125
The second strike is coming.

27
00:01:04,125 --> 00:01:05,917
I must attack before it does.

28
00:01:05,917 --> 00:01:07,292
Spider silk!

29
00:01:08,292 --> 00:01:10,000
It's on fire!

30
00:01:10,667 --> 00:01:12,625
A spider who can't use its spider silks

31
00:01:12,625 --> 00:01:15,583
is like Natto beans without Natto bacteria.

32
00:01:15,583 --> 00:01:18,375
They're just spoiled beans.

33
00:01:18,375 --> 00:01:20,292
No! The Middle stratum is so scary.

34
00:01:20,292 --> 00:01:23,042
I'm doomed.

35
00:01:23,042 --> 00:01:27,083

♫Wait and see♫

59
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:53,167
SO I'M A SPIDER, SO WHAT?

60
00:02:53,667 --> 00:02:56,542
I shall first find refuge in the Lower Stratum.

61
00:02:56,542 --> 00:02:59,708
According to the ability values,
they aren't unbeatable opponents.

62
00:02:59,708 --> 00:03:03,042
But I don't know what else to do
if I can't use spider silks.

63
00:03:03,042 --> 00:03:04,375
Cleverly,

64
00:03:04,375 --> 00:03:05,667
they took advantage of me.

65
00:03:05,667 --> 00:03:07,167
I can't reconciled to this.

66
00:03:07,167 --> 00:03:09,583
Although I just expressed myself in haiku,

67
00:03:09,583 --> 00:03:13,000
I still can't figure a way to fight the lava.

68
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,250
What should I do?

69
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:17,500
But can I reach
Upper Stratum via Middle Stratum?

70
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:20,000
Can I climb up the hole
where the bees fell from?

71
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,333
No way!

72
00:03:21,333 --> 00:03:22,750
Impossible. I don't want it.

73
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:24,833
Should I find another ground hole?

74
00:03:24,833 --> 00:03:27,917
Is there really a hole where I can pass easily?

75
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:30,792
Although it's not impossible,

76
00:03:30,792 --> 00:03:33,083
it doesn't seem plausible.

77
00:03:33,083 --> 00:03:35,542
What should I do?

78
00:03:35,542 --> 00:03:37,792
Anyway, ignore the situation for now.

79
00:03:37,792 --> 00:03:39,500
Let's evolve first.

80
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,292
After defeating the apes, my level upgraded.

81
00:03:41,292 --> 00:03:42,917
I'll practise after I evolve.

82
00:03:42,917 --> 00:03:43,917
When I become stronger,

83
00:03:43,917 --> 00:03:46,917
I'll challenge
the Middle Stratum again, confidently.

84
00:03:47,583 --> 00:03:50,250
Okay, that's the plan.

85
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:52,208
I want to evolve into...

86
00:03:52,208 --> 00:03:53,625
"SMALL SPIDER MONSTER"
Not bad.

87
00:03:53,625 --> 00:03:55,542
It's a rare species and it's very venomous.

88
00:03:55,542 --> 00:03:57,708
Please evolve me into this.

89
00:03:57,708 --> 00:03:59,125
Good night.

90
00:04:00,125 --> 00:04:01,667
EVOLUTION

91
00:04:01,667 --> 00:04:04,625
Good morning. Announce the result.

92
00:04:04,625 --> 00:04:05,500
SMALL SPIDER MONSTER

93
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,792
"LEVEL ONE. NAMELESS."
I've evolved.

94
00:04:07,792 --> 00:04:09,000
Three-digit numbers.

95
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,333
The values have increased so much.

96
00:04:11,333 --> 00:04:13,708
I can have a good fight
with the seahorse just now.

97
00:04:13,708 --> 00:04:18,708
As usual, my speed value is unbelievably high.

98
00:04:18,708 --> 00:04:21,083
It seems that
even the skill points are displayed.

99
00:04:21,083 --> 00:04:24,208
Good job, Miss Identification.

100
00:04:24,208 --> 00:04:27,042
What is this?
Is this the reward of the level upgrade?

101
00:04:27,042 --> 00:04:29,125
I can even read all the skills.

102
00:04:29,125 --> 00:04:30,667
There are so many skills.

103
00:04:31,458 --> 00:04:36,833
I guess this is the list of skills
which I can redeem with my skill points.

104
00:04:36,833 --> 00:04:40,167
Miss Identification is awesome.

105
00:04:41,208 --> 00:04:47,000
Let's see if there's any skill that
can be used to break through Middle Stratum,

106
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,333
since I can't use my spider silks.

107
00:04:50,083 --> 00:04:52,042
ARROGANCE

108
00:04:52,042 --> 00:04:53,542
"100 POINTS REQUIRED"
Arrogance?

109
00:04:53,542 --> 00:04:59,792
Arrogance... 60, 70, 80 thousands.

110
00:04:59,792 --> 00:05:02,792
What is a feel-good skill?

111
00:05:03,583 --> 00:05:07,000
The n% power of not wanting to be god.

112
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:13,458
Experience and proficiency will be significantly
improved after obtaining this skill.

113
00:05:13,458 --> 00:05:16,333
At the same time, I can override the system

114
00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:19,458
and have the right to interfere MA area.

115
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:21,750
I see.

116
00:05:22,625 --> 00:05:23,917
I don't understand at all.

117
00:05:23,917 --> 00:05:26,500
"RIGHT TO INTERFERE. MOVIE TICKET"
Right to interfere and movie tickets

118
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:30,167
can be obtained just by watching a movie.

119
00:05:32,292 --> 00:05:33,708
Even if I make a joke silently,

120
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:35,583
no one would complain.

121
00:05:35,583 --> 00:05:38,583
This is my lonely daily life.

122
00:05:38,583 --> 00:05:40,750
However, let's ignore that.

123
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:44,000
I know that increased experience and proficiency

124
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,875
can help me grow.

125
00:05:46,875 --> 00:05:48,042
That's great.

126
00:05:48,042 --> 00:05:49,042
However,

127
00:05:49,042 --> 00:05:51,708
everyone knows that arrogance is
one of the Seven Deadly Sins.

128
00:05:51,708 --> 00:05:53,000
It's a serious sin.

129
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,875
It's a title
which only the head of demons will have.

130
00:05:56,875 --> 00:05:59,667
If this title appeared in a game,

131
00:05:59,667 --> 00:06:01,417
it might indicate the final boss

132
00:06:01,417 --> 00:06:03,583
or the name of a cursed weapon.

133
00:06:03,583 --> 00:06:05,208
It's not a good thing.

134
00:06:06,083 --> 00:06:09,708
I think I've seen n% and W somewhere.

135
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:12,417
"n%=W"
That's it.

136
00:06:12,417 --> 00:06:14,667
The mysterious skill.

137
00:06:14,667 --> 00:06:16,125
This must be relevant.

138
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:17,708
It has to be relevant.

139
00:06:17,708 --> 00:06:19,583
Although I'm not entirely sure,

140
00:06:19,583 --> 00:06:21,375
I have a hunch.

141
00:06:21,917 --> 00:06:23,917
I must get this skill.

142
00:06:23,917 --> 00:06:28,833
You may redeem
the arrogance skill with 100 points.

143
00:06:28,833 --> 00:06:30,542
Would you like to redeem it?

144
00:06:30,542 --> 00:06:31,250
"ARROGANCE"
Yes.

145
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:33,333
Arrogance obtained.

146
00:06:33,333 --> 00:06:35,375
Yes, I got it!

147
00:06:35,375 --> 00:06:37,875
"ARROGANCE SKILL OBTAINED"
Proficiency achieved a certain target.

148
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:41,625
"EXCLUSION UPGRADED FROM LEVEL TWO TO FOUR."
Exclusion skill upgraded to level four.

149
00:06:41,625 --> 00:06:43,167
What? Exclusion?

150
00:06:43,167 --> 00:06:44,750
I forgot about that.

151
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:47,833
That's the skill I got after eating my comrades

152
00:06:47,833 --> 00:06:51,000
and obtaining the Cannibal title.
"EXCLUSION. LEVEL ONE"

153
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,583
"THOSE COMMITTED TABOOS WILL GET THE EXCLUSION SKILL."
This bad skill is upgraded.

154
00:06:53,583 --> 00:06:55,875
"NEVER LET IT UPGRADE"
I ruined it.

155
00:06:55,875 --> 00:06:57,667
"CONDITIONS FULFILLED"
Conditions fulfilled.

156
00:06:57,667 --> 00:07:01,458
"TITLE: THE RULER OF ARROGANCE"
The title, The Ruler of Arrogance, is obtained.

157
00:07:01,458 --> 00:07:04,333
"AS AN EFFECT OF THE NEW TITLE"
As an effect of the new title,

158
00:07:04,333 --> 00:07:06,833
"SKILL: ABYSS MAGIC LEVEL TEN AND UNDERWORLD"
Abyss Magic level ten and Underworld obtained.

159
00:07:06,833 --> 00:07:07,708
This is awesome!

160
00:07:07,708 --> 00:07:11,042
I got many powerful skills.

161
00:07:11,042 --> 00:07:12,292
Abyss Magic.

162
00:07:12,292 --> 00:07:15,208
It sounds like a high-level magic.

163
00:07:15,208 --> 00:07:18,958
Let's identify the new skills first.

164
00:07:20,833 --> 00:07:24,250
I think the values have increased
100 points averagely.

165
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:26,875
What is this?
This is also an effect of Arrogance?

166
00:07:26,875 --> 00:07:29,667
I have nothing against the increase in value.

167
00:07:29,667 --> 00:07:33,167
Good job, Arrogance, good job.

168
00:07:33,167 --> 00:07:35,708
"ABYSS MAGIC. MAGIC OF THE HIGHEST LEVEL."
Let's see. Abyss Magic.

169
00:07:35,708 --> 00:07:40,083
It looks very powerful. Underworld series.

170
00:07:40,083 --> 00:07:42,625
"UNDERWORLD"
This has nothing to do with the magical effect.

171
00:07:42,625 --> 00:07:44,625
Who made such skills?

172
00:07:45,292 --> 00:07:47,750
Forget it. Underworld?

173
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:50,708
"MAKE UNDERWORLD APPEAR"
This doesn't look too well.

174
00:07:50,708 --> 00:07:53,500
But even bad skills can perhaps be useful.

175
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,292
Just give it a try.

176
00:07:55,917 --> 00:07:57,333
Show up.

177
00:07:57,333 --> 00:08:01,208
Underworld!

178
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,625
Nothing happened.

179
00:08:05,625 --> 00:08:08,458
My interest has fallen into the Underworld.

180
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,667
I can't even imagine
the appearance of Underworld.

181
00:08:13,667 --> 00:08:14,667
Forget it.

182
00:08:14,667 --> 00:08:17,708
In short, if I want to defeat Middle Stratum,

183
00:08:17,708 --> 00:08:19,958
I must train my new skills quickly

184
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:24,375
and become heat resistant against the lava.

185
00:08:24,375 --> 00:08:27,417
After all, I have so many skills...

186
00:08:27,417 --> 00:08:30,375
"DEVIL. LEVEL ONE."
What? Devil? There's Devil.

187
00:08:30,375 --> 00:08:33,042
There's such a skill.

188
00:08:33,042 --> 00:08:35,332
Devil and Arrogance...

189
00:08:35,332 --> 00:08:37,707
It feels like I'm moving towards
the goal of the Great Devil.

190
00:08:37,707 --> 00:08:40,791
No. My goal is to pass Middle Stratum first.

191
00:08:40,792 --> 00:08:42,625
Train my skills.

192
00:08:42,625 --> 00:08:44,458
Let's practise.

193
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:48,500
This time... I can really...

194
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:53,333
call myself Devil, right?

195
00:08:54,542 --> 00:08:58,917
My identity is Spider Devil.

196
00:08:58,917 --> 00:09:00,958
Just kidding.

197
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:04,417
Hey...

198
00:09:04,417 --> 00:09:05,167
SO I'M A SPIDER, SO WHAT?

199
00:09:05,167 --> 00:09:07,458
Again.
"SO I'M A SPIDER, SO WHAT?"

200
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,333
It hurts.

201
00:09:12,333 --> 00:09:15,667
Don't climb up suddenly.

202
00:09:15,667 --> 00:09:18,042
I'm sorry.

203
00:09:18,042 --> 00:09:20,792
But it feels like...

204
00:09:20,792 --> 00:09:22,625
you've grown.

205
00:09:22,625 --> 00:09:24,750
That's because I've evolved.

206
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:27,000
This is still considered small.

207
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,917
When I evolve to another level higher,

208
00:09:28,917 --> 00:09:31,375
I'll become even bigger.

209
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:34,333
Wouldn't you be bigger than this room then?

210
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:36,625
That would be bad.

211
00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:38,792
May I identify your ability values?

212
00:09:38,792 --> 00:09:40,417
You may.

213
00:09:42,375 --> 00:09:45,917
Your ability values are averagely 700 and above.

214
00:09:46,667 --> 00:09:48,083
You've surpassed me.

215
00:09:48,083 --> 00:09:49,125
I'm a monster after all.

216
00:09:49,125 --> 00:09:52,750
My ability values increase faster than humans'.

217
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:55,917
This is considered as low level for dragons.

218
00:09:55,917 --> 00:09:57,833
If I keep evolving,

219
00:09:57,833 --> 00:10:00,250
the values may exceed 1000.

220
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:01,958
Just by looking at the ability values,

221
00:10:01,958 --> 00:10:06,208
you might have already
caught up with Brother Julius.

222
00:10:06,208 --> 00:10:08,667
Fei, you're not an ordinary monster.

223
00:10:08,667 --> 00:10:10,875
You have the perseverance of humans
after reincarnation.

224
00:10:11,708 --> 00:10:14,792
If all the monsters in the world were like you,

225
00:10:14,792 --> 00:10:18,042
all human beings and demons
might be demolished.

226
00:10:18,042 --> 00:10:21,417
This is not a compliment for a girl.

227
00:10:21,417 --> 00:10:24,375
If there's a monster like you,

228
00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:27,583
a monster that has humans' wisdom...

229
00:10:27,583 --> 00:10:33,125
But such extraordinary existences
wouldn't be seen everywhere.

230
00:10:33,125 --> 00:10:34,708
Since you've grown,

231
00:10:34,708 --> 00:10:38,000
we shall have them prepare
table and chair specially for you.

232
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,208
I've reincarnated as a dragon,

233
00:10:40,208 --> 00:10:42,083
yet I still have to go to school.

234
00:10:42,083 --> 00:10:44,458
The reincarnation makes no difference.

235
00:10:45,583 --> 00:10:46,875
Good morning, Your Highness.

236
00:10:47,625 --> 00:10:56,417
Good morning.

237
00:10:56,417 --> 00:10:58,333
Ever since you defeated the earth dragon,

238
00:10:58,333 --> 00:11:02,042
every student looks at you admirably.

239
00:11:02,042 --> 00:11:05,917
But it was Fei who defeated it in the end.

240
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:08,583
I'm so proud.

241
00:11:08,583 --> 00:11:10,875
You're the hero of the school.

242
00:11:10,875 --> 00:11:12,792
No, it's the warrior!

243
00:11:12,792 --> 00:11:15,292
Don't do that, Sue.

244
00:11:15,292 --> 00:11:18,000
But there's someone who's jealous of you.

245
00:11:21,167 --> 00:11:22,875
Although he's finding flaws intentionally,

246
00:11:22,875 --> 00:11:24,708
he looks like he's harbouring evil intentions.

247
00:11:24,708 --> 00:11:25,875
You must be careful.

248
00:11:25,875 --> 00:11:27,917
I hope he doesn't bother me.

249
00:11:27,917 --> 00:11:30,083
Good morning, Shun.

250
00:11:30,083 --> 00:11:32,750
-Good morning...
-Do you want to join The Religion of God's Words?

251
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:34,625
It's about this matter again.

252
00:11:34,625 --> 00:11:37,042
In order to hear more words of God,

253
00:11:37,042 --> 00:11:39,458
one must upgrade his skill level.

254
00:11:39,458 --> 00:11:41,500
That's the doctrine
of The Religion of God's Words, right?

255
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,167
That's right.

256
00:11:42,167 --> 00:11:45,500
I heard many words of God yesterday.

257
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:50,583
Ever since I joined the religion,
God's words have been important to me.

258
00:11:50,583 --> 00:11:53,292
You have many skills, right?

259
00:11:53,292 --> 00:11:55,458
You must upgrade them from now on

260
00:11:55,458 --> 00:11:57,500
so you can hear the words of God.

261
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:58,167
No...

262
00:11:58,167 --> 00:11:59,958
You can identify as well, right?

263
00:11:59,958 --> 00:12:02,250
If you find people who use forbidden skills,

264
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:03,167
please tell me.

265
00:12:03,167 --> 00:12:03,958
Forbidden...

266
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:07,042
Because it's unforgivable to have

267
00:12:07,042 --> 00:12:09,042
forbidden skills.

268
00:12:09,042 --> 00:12:11,000
They're unforgivable

269
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,708
and don't deserve to live.

270
00:12:12,708 --> 00:12:14,042
They should be destroyed.

271
00:12:14,042 --> 00:12:15,458
You mean, destroyed...

272
00:12:15,458 --> 00:12:17,208
So you must tell me.

273
00:12:17,208 --> 00:12:18,458
It's our promise.

274
00:12:18,458 --> 00:12:21,583
Forbidden, okay? Remember that.

275
00:12:22,417 --> 00:12:25,208
So, do you want to join the religion?

276
00:12:25,208 --> 00:12:26,667
That's too close.

277
00:12:26,667 --> 00:12:27,958
-Well...
-Do you want to join?

278
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:30,917
Sorry, I'm an atheist.

279
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:33,792
You shouldn't say things like that.

280
00:12:33,792 --> 00:12:37,750
Because The Religion of God's Words
is supporting warriors as well.

281
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:38,750
Warriors?

282
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:39,625
That's right.

283
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:43,125
That means, your respected warrior, Mr. Julius,

284
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:45,083
is under the protection of our religion too.

285
00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:46,292
That's the case.

286
00:12:46,292 --> 00:12:48,250
Warrior...

287
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:50,000
Brother Julius as well?

288
00:12:50,833 --> 00:12:52,833
Let's talk next time.

289
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,083
Forbidden. Don't forget.

290
00:12:56,083 --> 00:12:57,583
Tell me when you find them.

291
00:12:57,583 --> 00:12:59,042
I need to destroy them.

292
00:12:59,042 --> 00:13:00,917
Okay, I'll remember it.

293
00:13:00,917 --> 00:13:02,833
Yuri... No.

294
00:13:02,833 --> 00:13:06,167
Hasebe wasn't like that.

295
00:13:06,167 --> 00:13:09,083
Perhaps this is the result
of her growth environment.

296
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:11,250
I heard she was abandoned as a baby

297
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:13,833
and brought up in the church.

298
00:13:13,833 --> 00:13:16,208
To have the memory of her previous life

299
00:13:16,208 --> 00:13:18,083
and being abandoned by her parents.

300
00:13:18,083 --> 00:13:20,000
Growing up in such situations,

301
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,708
there's no wonder that she doesn't trust humans

302
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:24,375
and put all her hope in a religion.

303
00:13:28,542 --> 00:13:33,042
Today's class is about
the physical effect of magic.

304
00:13:33,042 --> 00:13:36,708
I would like to use magic.

305
00:13:38,167 --> 00:13:42,167
If someone invited me to become a magical girl,

306
00:13:42,167 --> 00:13:44,625
I would definitely say yes.

307
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:46,708
The magic of spiders.

308
00:13:46,708 --> 00:13:49,000
The unbelievable magic of spiders.

309
00:13:51,167 --> 00:13:55,208
After training, my HP value
recovered to level five automatically.

310
00:13:55,208 --> 00:13:57,333
If I can improve my fire-resistance skill,

311
00:13:57,333 --> 00:14:01,500
I will be able to resist
the heat damage of Middle Stratum.

312
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:07,375
But the biggest problem is,
I must fight the monsters in lava.

313
00:14:07,375 --> 00:14:08,542
If I can use magic,

314
00:14:08,542 --> 00:14:11,708
I may win even without spider silks.

315
00:14:11,708 --> 00:14:15,583
However, I must first have
the conditional skills to use the magic.

316
00:14:15,583 --> 00:14:17,708
It seems, the most plausible...

317
00:14:17,708 --> 00:14:19,583
MAGIC INDUCTION AND MAGIC CONTROL

318
00:14:19,583 --> 00:14:22,208
Induct magic, then control...

319
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:27,125
I'm sure I can't use magic
without these two skills.

320
00:14:27,125 --> 00:14:29,000
Should I redeem it?

321
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:34,833
No. The strong headache I experienced
when using the investigation skill

322
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:39,917
made me understand the feelings of Monkey King
when his head was tightened.

323
00:14:39,917 --> 00:14:43,250
Since then, the investigation skill
is temporarily sealed forever.

324
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:47,458
If it's a skill like the investigation skill,
it will be useless to redeem it.

325
00:14:47,458 --> 00:14:48,583
But if I don't redeem it,

326
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:52,542
Abyss Magic and other similar skills
will be useless too.

327
00:14:52,542 --> 00:14:54,792
Such an unsolvable loop.

328
00:14:54,792 --> 00:14:57,042
Thinking makes me hungry.

329
00:14:57,792 --> 00:15:00,417
I shall go hunt first.

330
00:15:08,583 --> 00:15:12,625
EARTH DRAGON KAGNA. LEVEL 26.

331
00:15:12,625 --> 00:15:13,958
What?

332
00:15:13,958 --> 00:15:16,583
It's a different kind of
earth dragon than Araba.

333
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,458
Oh, no! It wants to attack again.

334
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:22,708
All its ability values have four-digit numbers.

335
00:15:22,708 --> 00:15:24,083
I can't defeat it.

336
00:15:24,083 --> 00:15:26,708
Oh, no! What should I do?

337
00:15:27,667 --> 00:15:30,250
I can only go that way.

338
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:31,625
Run!

339
00:15:32,417 --> 00:15:34,042
I'm coming, Middle Stratum.

340
00:15:34,042 --> 00:15:34,917
Yeah!

341
00:15:34,917 --> 00:15:37,625
Next, I'm going to pass through Middle Stratum.

342
00:15:37,625 --> 00:15:39,083
Yeah!

343
00:15:40,208 --> 00:15:43,250
If I don't boost my own spirit,
I won't be able to go on.

344
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:46,792
As I thought, I can indeed resist heat damage

345
00:15:46,792 --> 00:15:49,375
with fire-resistance skill
and automatic recovery.

346
00:15:49,375 --> 00:15:52,375
But it's just as hot.

347
00:15:54,083 --> 00:15:55,667
This fireball...

348
00:15:55,667 --> 00:15:58,167
Is this the seahorse from last time?

349
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:03,458
This speed can no longer defeat me.

350
00:16:03,458 --> 00:16:05,750
See? I'm much faster.

351
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:09,500
Even this game character can't keep up
with my dodging skill.

352
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:12,208
But I have no way to get into the lava.

353
00:16:12,208 --> 00:16:13,708
Without using spider silks,

354
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:16,042
I can't even fight back.

355
00:16:16,042 --> 00:16:18,083
We're desperate on both sides.

356
00:16:19,458 --> 00:16:22,625
Odd, its MP value seems to have decreased.

357
00:16:22,625 --> 00:16:25,792
It looks like shooting fireballs
decreases its MP level.

358
00:16:25,792 --> 00:16:27,292
It's going to be exhausted soon.

359
00:16:27,292 --> 00:16:28,833
It launched again.

360
00:16:29,958 --> 00:16:31,875
Its MP value has been used up.

361
00:16:31,875 --> 00:16:34,542
What would it do next?

362
00:16:35,792 --> 00:16:37,833
It's coming out of the lava.

363
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:39,250
What?

364
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:40,708
It's so slow.

365
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:41,917
It's so stupid.

366
00:16:41,917 --> 00:16:42,708
If it were me,

367
00:16:42,708 --> 00:16:46,583
I would retreat before my MP value is used up.

368
00:16:46,583 --> 00:16:48,083
Dodged easily.

369
00:16:48,083 --> 00:16:50,917
The final skill, venomous strike!

370
00:16:50,917 --> 00:16:52,667
It's hot.

371
00:16:55,708 --> 00:16:57,625
First battle, clear.

372
00:17:00,458 --> 00:17:02,917
It tastes horrible.

373
00:17:02,917 --> 00:17:04,166
It's so hard.

374
00:17:04,166 --> 00:17:07,541
It's as if I'm eating a tire.

375
00:17:10,916 --> 00:17:13,207
Is that another seahorse?

376
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,208
"ELROE GUNESEVEN"
Is that a catfish?

377
00:17:20,208 --> 00:17:21,833
Powerful.

378
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:25,208
EATING EVERYTHING WITH ITS ENORMOUS MOUTH.

379
00:17:25,208 --> 00:17:27,500
I think so too.

380
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,625
It's powerful.

381
00:17:29,625 --> 00:17:30,792
I shouldn't flaunt my superiority.

382
00:17:30,792 --> 00:17:33,083
Although I'm in a high spirit from the victory,

383
00:17:33,083 --> 00:17:36,208
I may suffer if I go wild with joy now.

384
00:17:36,208 --> 00:17:38,833
Mr. Seahorse, sorry for not eating you up.

385
00:17:38,833 --> 00:17:41,375
I must learn my lesson.

386
00:17:42,458 --> 00:17:45,083
Don't find me.

387
00:17:48,708 --> 00:17:51,583
That's not how it supposed to be.

388
00:17:51,583 --> 00:17:53,167
I didn't go wild with joy,

389
00:17:53,167 --> 00:17:54,917
yet I ended up in a crisis.

390
00:17:57,125 --> 00:17:58,500
Jump backwards.

391
00:17:59,167 --> 00:18:00,583
That was close.

392
00:18:01,167 --> 00:18:03,500
What creature is this? It has limbs!

393
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,625
It's hot.

394
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:07,292
What? The one just now crawled out as well.

395
00:18:07,292 --> 00:18:09,625
You should at least mention
that you're leaving the pool.

396
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:12,500
I'm surrounded. I'm surrounded on both sides.

397
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:15,875
I have to beat the first one quickly.

398
00:18:15,875 --> 00:18:17,333
Venomous spider silks.

399
00:18:19,292 --> 00:18:22,500
They're useless here
as they're burnt off almost immediately.

400
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:25,458
Please, swallow at least a little.

401
00:18:28,083 --> 00:18:30,583
It's indeed burnt off immediately.

402
00:18:31,917 --> 00:18:34,083
But their HP values have also reduced a little.

403
00:18:34,083 --> 00:18:38,167
I learned how to use
venomous spider silks by training.

404
00:18:38,167 --> 00:18:40,708
You shall be killed by
my venomous spider silks slowly.

405
00:18:40,708 --> 00:18:42,417
Great! Second strike!

406
00:18:43,167 --> 00:18:44,792
EATING EVERYTHING WITH ITS ENORMOUS MOUTH.

407
00:18:46,167 --> 00:18:48,250
It can swallow anything indeed.

408
00:18:49,125 --> 00:18:50,917
Synthesised venom!

409
00:18:50,917 --> 00:18:53,458
Next, jump backwards.

410
00:18:53,458 --> 00:18:55,708
That was really a crucial moment.

411
00:18:59,542 --> 00:19:00,417
How was it?

412
00:19:00,417 --> 00:19:03,000
It was a venom that could even kill the big ape.

413
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,917
Now I've improved it into
a strong spider venom through training.

414
00:19:07,917 --> 00:19:10,417
But I didn't expect it to be so strong either.

415
00:19:10,417 --> 00:19:13,042
It's a power that even I'm afraid of.

416
00:19:13,042 --> 00:19:14,625
This is not the time to slack.

417
00:19:14,625 --> 00:19:16,542
I have another one to deal with.

418
00:19:16,542 --> 00:19:19,083
It's afraid.

419
00:19:19,083 --> 00:19:22,833
There's no wonder, since it saw
how horribly its comrade died.

420
00:19:22,833 --> 00:19:24,750
I'm rather powerful.

421
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:27,000
It's okay that I go a little wild with joy.

422
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,083
Kill it first.

423
00:19:29,083 --> 00:19:32,708
It's hot.

424
00:19:33,292 --> 00:19:35,500
Continuous victories should
upgrade my ability values, right?

425
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:38,833
"THE RULER OF ARROGANCE"
Since the identification skill is upgraded,

426
00:19:38,833 --> 00:19:41,875
"MAY IMPROVE MP, MAGIC, PATIENCE AND SO ON."
my title is shown.

427
00:19:42,583 --> 00:19:46,458
What is the class privilege of a ruler?

428
00:19:46,458 --> 00:19:48,917
What is this? May I use it now?

429
00:19:48,917 --> 00:19:53,708
You still don't have the authority
to exercise The Ruler of Arrogance.

430
00:19:53,708 --> 00:19:55,042
I'm not allowed?

431
00:19:55,042 --> 00:19:58,583
But this looks more fleshy than the seahorse.

432
00:19:58,583 --> 00:20:01,750
It would be even better if it tastes good.

433
00:20:13,833 --> 00:20:17,000
It's so tasty!

434
00:20:18,708 --> 00:20:19,917
Good.

435
00:20:19,917 --> 00:20:22,250
Catfish tastes good indeed.

436
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:26,958
This is awesome.

437
00:20:26,958 --> 00:20:29,875
It tastes better than
all the monsters I've eaten.

438
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:33,875
Bland white meat with just enough fats.

439
00:20:33,875 --> 00:20:36,583
The tenderness of the fish skin

440
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:38,417
and fish meat is perfect.

441
00:20:38,417 --> 00:20:41,833
This combination creates a feast of taste.

442
00:20:41,833 --> 00:20:45,958
This is a labyrinth of food.

443
00:20:45,958 --> 00:20:47,000
This is awesome.

444
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,375
It's warm. I would like to have rice with it.

445
00:20:53,958 --> 00:20:55,917
A bowl of hot rice with catfish.

446
00:20:55,917 --> 00:20:57,875
I can eat five bowls of rice easily.

447
00:20:57,875 --> 00:21:00,333
Bread would do too.

448
00:21:00,333 --> 00:21:01,708
Catfish burger.

449
00:21:01,708 --> 00:21:03,333
Catfish spaghetti.

450
00:21:03,333 --> 00:21:06,000
Catfish with soba noodles.

451
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,042
What a mistake.

452
00:21:08,042 --> 00:21:11,833
If I knew it tastes so good,
I wouldn't let the other one escape.

453
00:21:12,583 --> 00:21:15,583
I'll just enjoy this catfish for now.

454
00:21:15,583 --> 00:21:17,083
It's so delicious.

455
00:21:17,083 --> 00:21:19,375
I'm so lucky to be born in this world.

456
00:21:24,417 --> 00:21:26,417
Okay, let's catch catfish.

457
00:21:26,417 --> 00:21:27,708
Even if they're strong opponents.

458
00:21:27,708 --> 00:21:29,625
Even if I may risk my life.

459
00:21:29,625 --> 00:21:33,500
Catfish...

460
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,083
Hooray, catfish!

461
00:21:35,083 --> 00:21:35,875
Hooray!

462
00:21:35,875 --> 00:21:37,250
Wait and see, catfish.

463
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:39,375
I'll eat you up.

464
00:21:39,375 --> 00:21:43,292
Catfish! Hooray! Let's shout together.

465
00:21:46,125 --> 00:21:47,375
Do you know? This is the prelude.

466
00:21:47,375 --> 00:21:49,667
The life of a spider.

467
00:21:49,667 --> 00:21:51,250
I'm going to start singing.
