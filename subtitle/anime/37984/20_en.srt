1
00:00:02,917 --> 00:00:06,042
So many delicious food.

2
00:00:06,042 --> 00:00:08,583
It isn't too bad to help people.

3
00:00:13,542 --> 00:00:14,708
What's going on?

4
00:00:15,958 --> 00:00:19,167
Are you the Nightmare of the Labyrinth?

5
00:00:19,167 --> 00:00:20,750
Who is this?

6
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:25,458
It's hard to believe that
this insect destroyed the fortress.

7
00:00:25,458 --> 00:00:26,833
Whatever.

8
00:00:26,833 --> 00:00:30,000
Insect? He must be talking about me.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,958
Although I only understand words,
I get what he's talking about.

10
00:00:33,958 --> 00:00:36,625
Destroy the fortress?

11
00:00:36,625 --> 00:00:39,625
What is this?

12
00:00:50,833 --> 00:00:55,042
It's not good to kill them all of a sudden.
I should control my strength.

13
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,583
You asked for this.

14
00:01:09,083 --> 00:01:10,375
That's what he meant.

15
00:01:10,375 --> 00:01:14,375
I accidentally blew up that place
and the people there?

16
00:01:14,375 --> 00:01:20,167
You should be proud.
We, Ohts, are planning to rear you.

17
00:01:20,167 --> 00:01:23,250
What is he talking about? I don't want that.

18
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:25,375
What are you talking about?

19
00:01:25,375 --> 00:01:27,292
How could you be so rude to the Mythical Beast?

20
00:01:27,292 --> 00:01:28,417
Shut up.

21
00:01:31,125 --> 00:01:37,000
How dare you point at me with weapons.
I'm the official envoy of Ohts.

22
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,875
You should know what that means.

23
00:01:40,875 --> 00:01:45,958
This thing belongs to Ohts.
We will treat it however we please.

24
00:01:45,958 --> 00:01:50,750
The face of this fatso is repelling.

25
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:54,833
You have no right to refuse. Come with me.

26
00:01:57,375 --> 00:01:59,958
What are you doing?

27
00:02:03,917 --> 00:02:05,750
Where are you going?

28
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:11,250
How dare this worthless insect despise me?
It must die!

29
00:02:12,292 --> 00:02:15,583
This fellow is a typical bad guy.

53

We got another letter.

54
00:03:54,958 --> 00:03:57,917
How many have we gotten this month?

55
00:03:57,917 --> 00:04:03,208
Including the diplomats
and nobles living in this house,

56
00:04:03,208 --> 00:04:05,542
this is the 10th one.

57
00:04:06,708 --> 00:04:08,875
This is really endless.

58
00:04:08,875 --> 00:04:13,958
I'm not sure if this is the credit or fault
of the Nightmare of the Labyrinth.

59
00:04:13,958 --> 00:04:18,958
Although our network is getting wider,
we have attracted many guests.

60
00:04:20,291 --> 00:04:22,417
Cursed you...

61
00:04:22,417 --> 00:04:25,833
This annoying insect. How dare it despise me?

62
00:04:27,958 --> 00:04:30,708
This is exactly the kind of guests
we don't want to provoke.

63
00:04:30,708 --> 00:04:36,500
After all, he's the official envoy of Ohts.
We can't despise him.

64
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
What should we do?

65
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,750
Grab it by force to show them our power.

66
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:48,625
What method should we use?

67
00:04:48,625 --> 00:04:52,417
It doesn't matter how you do it,
get me that thing.

68
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:54,833
I understand.

69
00:05:00,292 --> 00:05:05,208
In order to avoid wars with Ohts, I worked hard
to maintain the diplomacy of both countries.

70
00:05:05,208 --> 00:05:08,625
If the Nightmare of the Labyrinth
causes the two countries to fight,

71
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:11,583
a real nightmare will come true.

72
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,125
I may talk too much.

73
00:05:15,125 --> 00:05:21,208
But I don't know what Ohts is thinking
by sending that man here.

74
00:05:21,208 --> 00:05:24,167
Same goes to the tariffs and the bandits.

75
00:05:24,167 --> 00:05:27,250
Are they trying to start a war?

76
00:05:28,625 --> 00:05:33,333
We must not let the war happen.
Let's handle this carefully.

77
00:05:39,958 --> 00:05:44,583
That fatso seems to be
in the house of the vampire child.

78
00:05:50,375 --> 00:05:54,375
This is so annoying.
I should just move far away from here.

79
00:05:54,375 --> 00:05:57,958
But the vampire child might be in danger.

80
00:05:57,958 --> 00:06:02,792
Besides, I will have to give up
the endless delicious fruits.

81
00:06:02,792 --> 00:06:04,625
This is a tricky situation.

82
00:06:06,167 --> 00:06:11,583
But no matter what,
when Devil comes I have to leave.

83
00:06:11,583 --> 00:06:14,458
I wonder what Devil is doing.

84
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:15,375
CLAIRVOYANCE

85
00:06:30,792 --> 00:06:33,125
What is that? It's so scary.

86
00:06:33,125 --> 00:06:37,833
Although I don't know what's going on,
Devil is fighting a very strong earth dragon.

87
00:06:37,833 --> 00:06:39,417
Go away, evil spirit.

88
00:06:39,417 --> 00:06:42,583
I hope the Devil
in the faraway land will never bother me.

89
00:06:42,583 --> 00:06:45,792
No matter what, thank you for buying me time.

90
00:06:45,792 --> 00:06:49,667
Work hard, earth dragon. I'm on your side.

91
00:06:51,083 --> 00:06:51,917
What's going on?

92
00:06:54,125 --> 00:06:55,167
This fellow...

93
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:59,042
The one who appeared
after I defeated the fire dragon.

94
00:06:59,042 --> 00:07:02,750
He appears again. What does he want?

95
00:07:03,917 --> 00:07:06,917
I'm not planning to do anything to you.

96
00:07:06,917 --> 00:07:12,917
So he's not trying to make trouble.
Is that what he means?

97
00:07:12,917 --> 00:07:16,083
It seems this is
our first time chatting like this.

98
00:07:16,083 --> 00:07:19,083
I'm admin Güliedistodiez.

99
00:07:19,083 --> 00:07:24,167
Gülie what? That's too long.
I shall call him Gülie.

100
00:07:24,167 --> 00:07:25,958
I want to ask for your favour.

101
00:07:25,958 --> 00:07:27,292
My favour?

102
00:07:27,292 --> 00:07:29,958
Can you stop fighting Ariel?

103
00:07:29,958 --> 00:07:31,750
What?

104
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:34,833
By Ariel he means Devil, right?

105
00:07:34,833 --> 00:07:40,083
I didn't fight her.
She was the one who attacked me first.

106
00:07:40,083 --> 00:07:44,667
I know what I suggested is very selfish.

107
00:07:44,667 --> 00:07:48,958
Hence I wouldn't complain
even if you reject my request.

108
00:07:51,042 --> 00:07:54,625
You're making this hard for me by saying that.

109
00:07:54,625 --> 00:07:57,542
I'm fleeing everywhere.
How can I be fighting Devil?

110
00:07:58,875 --> 00:08:00,500
Could it be that guy?

111
00:08:01,875 --> 00:08:03,583
-The previous person in charge of body.
-Body.

112
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:07,417
-Oh, right. That fellow went to the Devil.
-Body.

113
00:08:07,417 --> 00:08:14,208
We lost contact ever since mother died.
I don't know what she's up to.

114
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:15,417
I get it now.

115
00:08:15,417 --> 00:08:19,833
I thought Devil pursues me to revenge mother.

116
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:24,250
But it's because the previous person in charge
of body is attacking her spiritually.

117
00:08:25,417 --> 00:08:26,875
What do you say?

118
00:08:26,875 --> 00:08:32,292
Because I'm used to living alone,
I fall into my own world unintentionally.

119
00:08:32,292 --> 00:08:33,500
Excuse me.

120
00:08:36,917 --> 00:08:39,167
I can't do it.

121
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:40,332
Why?

122
00:08:40,332 --> 00:08:43,666
How do I say this?
The person who's attacking her now

123
00:08:43,667 --> 00:08:47,958
is my parallel will. Like a clone.

124
00:08:47,958 --> 00:08:53,375
I can't contact her at the moment. Therefore...

125
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:55,583
I see.

126
00:08:56,083 --> 00:09:00,375
I didn't know your situation
and made things tough for you. I'm sorry.

127
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:03,792
That's good news.

128
00:09:03,792 --> 00:09:09,667
Which means if I keep fleeing, the previous
person in charge of body will defeat Devil.

129
00:09:09,667 --> 00:09:12,000
I want to ask for another favour.

130
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:16,000
I hope you will never involve
yourself with the humans again.

131
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,792
Can you find a hidden place to live there?

132
00:09:18,792 --> 00:09:19,667
What?

133
00:09:19,667 --> 00:09:23,333
I'm sorry for getting you involved
in the matters of this world.

134
00:09:23,333 --> 00:09:26,250
But your power is too strong.

135
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:30,750
Oh my, even if you compliment me,
I won't be persuaded easily.

136
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:34,958
As soon as you take any action,
you cause a huge wave that can't be ignored.

137
00:09:35,958 --> 00:09:38,875
This may cause chaos in this world.

138
00:09:38,875 --> 00:09:44,917
I know that's a lot to ask.
But can you please consider it?

139
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:49,792
Since he asked me so sincerely,
I'd better answer him seriously.

140
00:09:51,167 --> 00:09:54,125
I deny.

I can't just do nothing and ignore it.

158
00:10:11,208 --> 00:10:14,625
I'm planning to do it according to my own will.

159
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,667
Do you insist?

160
00:10:21,292 --> 00:10:22,583
Really?

161
00:10:23,542 --> 00:10:28,125
To the people of Isekai,
my doings are laughable?

162
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:33,583
I can't answer that
because it's none of my business. But...

163
00:10:36,208 --> 00:10:39,208
Just do whatever you want.

164
00:10:40,208 --> 00:10:43,125
I see. I understand now.

165
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:47,875
After all, I can only
do things according to my will.

166
00:10:47,875 --> 00:10:51,125
That's all for today. Goodbye.

167
00:10:53,708 --> 00:10:57,625
I haven't talked to someone
so seriously for a long while. It's tiring.

168
00:10:57,625 --> 00:11:00,375
It seems hard to be an admin.

00:11:11,583 --> 00:11:13,083
You trash!

173
00:11:19,708 --> 00:11:23,250
The experience level of humans
is delicious as usual.

174
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:28,500
I remember this guy.
Isn't he the subordinate of the fatso?

175
00:11:29,875 --> 00:11:34,125
Unforgivable! How dare he harm me?
Although he didn't do it himself,

176
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:36,292
he should die just by having the thought.

177
00:11:36,292 --> 00:11:37,667
CLAIRVOYANCE EVIL EYE

178
00:11:39,292 --> 00:11:41,292
This irritating insect

179
00:11:41,292 --> 00:11:44,708
shall be used by me before being killed...

180
00:11:52,042 --> 00:12:00,250
Okay. After cleaning up the trash,
I shall get some sleep. Good night.

181
00:12:08,792 --> 00:12:11,042
Things are getting troublesome.

182
00:12:11,042 --> 00:12:12,875
Yes.

183
00:12:12,875 --> 00:12:18,417
Sudden death without any trauma. That is...

184
00:12:18,417 --> 00:12:21,125
It must have been
the Nightmare of the Labyrinth.

185
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:26,250
There have been corpses like this in the house.

186
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:31,250
This is no simple death. A human can't do this.

187
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:36,250
Judging from the timing, it has to be
the Nightmare of the Labyrinth who has done it.

188
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:42,167
But I really don't understand the reason
this city and Sariella support it.

189
00:12:42,167 --> 00:12:45,833
You mean the Mythical Beast of the legend?

190
00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:52,083
If that's the case, we could stop thinking
and be more open. But that's not the case.

191
00:12:53,417 --> 00:12:59,625
This is a big trouble.
The official envoy of Ohts died in our country.

192
00:12:59,625 --> 00:13:02,417
They will never let this go easily.

193
00:13:02,417 --> 00:13:08,750
He tried to harm the monster so he was killed.
It would be good if Ohts believed that.

194
00:13:09,792 --> 00:13:11,750
How did Ohts reply?

195
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:14,000
We haven't received it yet.

196
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:19,375
The letter was sent out a few days ago.
It's worrying that there's no reply.

197
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:25,167
I hope they won't do anything stupid
after seeing that man's behaviour.

198
00:13:25,917 --> 00:13:27,667
What's wrong?

199
00:13:28,583 --> 00:13:32,708
That man had never behaved like an envoy.

200
00:13:32,708 --> 00:13:35,417
Yes. You're right.

201
00:13:35,417 --> 00:13:39,667
I wonder if they really want to start a war.

202
00:13:39,667 --> 00:13:43,292
Having that man cause trouble
so they have an excuse...

203
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:49,958
How could that be? We're way stronger than Ohts.

204
00:13:49,958 --> 00:13:52,458
They have no way to win.

205
00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:56,958
That's right.
Logically they wouldn't do such a stupid thing.

206
00:13:56,958 --> 00:13:57,917
However...

207
00:13:57,917 --> 00:14:02,292
Report. Ohts has declared a war on our country.

208
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:16,375
Even Renxandt Empire and Holy Kingdom
of Alleuis sent troops to back Ohts up.

209
00:14:16,375 --> 00:14:20,333
How could that be? An alliance?

210
00:14:21,917 --> 00:14:22,917
OHTS. RENXANDT EMPIRE.
HOLY KINGDOM OF ALLEUIS.

211
00:14:22,917 --> 00:14:23,708
53,000 COALITION FORCES

212
00:14:23,708 --> 00:14:28,333
Did I cause the war by killing that fatso?

213
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:31,167
Let's see how the lord is.

214
00:14:32,833 --> 00:14:35,417
He's obviously in distress.

215
00:14:35,417 --> 00:14:37,833
I've caused trouble.

216
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:40,167
But I don't regret it.

217
00:14:40,167 --> 00:14:44,083
An eye for an eye. That's how I do it.

218
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:45,500
Despite so...

219
00:14:46,625 --> 00:14:50,875
Looking at how the lord is,
does it mean this country will lose?

220
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,167
Okay. Since I have to take care of
the vampire child and I've caused the war,

221
00:14:57,167 --> 00:14:59,375
I shall help this country.

222
00:15:01,042 --> 00:15:07,458
Besides, I can kill all the humans
with delicious experience values in the war.

223
00:15:07,458 --> 00:15:11,208
This is not my goal.

224
00:15:11,208 --> 00:15:14,708
Let's battle!

225
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:07,000
I want to kill you.

226
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,875
Wait for it, Shun.

227
00:16:14,625 --> 00:16:17,833
Brother Julius, watch this.

228
00:16:20,708 --> 00:16:23,917
Come on, Hugo.

229
00:16:37,833 --> 00:16:42,458
Eventually I still led the students to danger.

230
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:51,875
When I woke up, I realised
I've reincarnated in Isekai.

231
00:16:58,333 --> 00:17:03,917
What surprised me more was,
the people around me have long ears.

232
00:17:05,333 --> 00:17:10,375
According to my otaku knowledge,
I quickly recognised they're elves.

233
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,083
I also knew my own situation.

234
00:17:16,791 --> 00:17:20,332
I was a teacher in my previous life.

235
00:17:20,333 --> 00:17:25,541
To be a teacher who laughs
with her students was my dream.

236
00:17:25,541 --> 00:17:34,292
Game, manga, novels. I learned
all the topics that may interest the kids.

237
00:17:34,292 --> 00:17:37,250
In order to make them like me,
I changed the way I talked.

238
00:17:38,833 --> 00:17:43,875
All these effort made me think
I've become an approachable teacher.

239
00:17:45,833 --> 00:17:51,958
Is it really my dream to laugh
with my disguised self?

240
00:17:52,708 --> 00:18:00,917
I've doubted that too.
But my life as a teacher was quite well.

241
00:18:05,958 --> 00:18:07,500
However...

242
00:18:17,542 --> 00:18:22,292
I'm a weak person.
I can't be like the main character of a novel,

243
00:18:22,292 --> 00:18:26,417
to start a new second life.

244
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:30,125
I can't get rid of myself from my previous life.

245
00:18:30,125 --> 00:18:35,042
In my chaotic mind, the only thing
I can hold onto is my identity as a teacher.

246
00:18:36,083 --> 00:18:38,042
I'm a teacher.

247
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:43,333
A teacher should always make her students first.

248
00:18:43,333 --> 00:18:44,833
ELF. LEVEL ONE.
NAME: FILIMØS HARRIFENAS

249
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:50,083
Fortunately, I've gotten skills that suit me.

250
00:18:50,083 --> 00:18:51,750
STUDENT LIST

251
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:54,833
The inherit skill, Student List,

252
00:18:55,917 --> 00:19:03,375
is a simple record about the past and
future of the students who reincarnated like me.

253
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:11,167
In the future column, the estimated time
and cause of death of each student are stated.

254
00:19:12,583 --> 00:19:14,333
I was in despair.

255
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:16,000
OOSHIMA KANATA. DIED FROM DEPRIVED OF SKILLS.
NATSUME KENGO. DIED IN A WAR IN THE ELF FOREST.

256
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,792
It's stated that most students

257
00:19:17,792 --> 00:19:20,917
will died in 20 years.

258
00:19:31,167 --> 00:19:34,542
"TELEPATHY"
Telepathy skill obtained.

259
00:19:34,542 --> 00:19:36,417
Points left...

260
00:19:37,708 --> 00:19:40,000
Please help me.

261
00:19:48,208 --> 00:19:50,875
Please help my students.

262
00:19:52,417 --> 00:19:55,708
I told Potimas everything.

263
00:19:55,708 --> 00:20:00,250
I told him the memory
of the previous life and the Student List.

264
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:04,583
Okay. I will protect them.

265
00:20:05,542 --> 00:20:10,708
Although it was a dangerous bet,
I had no one else to rely on.

266
00:20:11,833 --> 00:20:16,375
Some were bought, some were kidnapped.

267
00:20:17,625 --> 00:20:21,375
Fortunately the cause
and time of death could be changed.

268
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:27,292
But there are two limitations to my skills.

269
00:20:27,292 --> 00:20:29,833
I can't read my own information

270
00:20:29,833 --> 00:20:35,042
and I can't reveal the information
on the Student List to the students.

271
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:41,875
Despite being hated
for trapping them in the village,

272
00:20:41,875 --> 00:20:45,750
it's better than having them dead.

273
00:20:46,792 --> 00:20:54,083
Because I'm a teacher.
I became so today because of my students.

274
00:20:56,500 --> 00:21:00,208
Why did things turn out like this?

275
00:21:01,542 --> 00:21:04,125
Is what I did right?

276
00:21:05,333 --> 00:21:07,500
Did I do something wrong?

277
00:21:09,042 --> 00:21:15,333
Have I indeed fulfilled my duty as a teacher?

Yes, master. Everything is ready.

00:23:03,208 --> 00:23:07,042
Everything is according to plan, right?

298
00:23:08,583 --> 00:23:11,750
We should be able to make a big fuss this time.

299
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:13,292
Others as well.

300
00:23:30,917 --> 00:23:33,667
Okay. Let's begin.

301
00:23:36,333 --> 00:23:41,458
SO I'M A SPIDER, SO WHAT?
