00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,042
EPISODE 12: MY BATTLE HAS, ONLY JUST BEGUN?

2
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:41,958
♫Looking at the end of the entangled karma♫

3
00:00:41,958 --> 00:00:44,333
♫Even my back is full of enemies♫

4
00:00:44,333 --> 00:00:45,708
♫Thousand of creatures♫

5
00:00:45,708 --> 00:00:47,292
♫who are arrogant and ready to charge♫

6
00:00:47,292 --> 00:00:48,375
♫Dive for alive♫

7
00:00:48,375 --> 00:00:49,500
♫Climb for life♫

8
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:52,042
♫A chaotic state that no one can survive♫

9
00:00:52,042 --> 00:00:56,333
♫Take this as my stage♫

10
00:00:56,333 --> 00:00:57,750
♫Is this over?♫

11
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:59,833
♫But I'm not done♫

12
00:00:59,833 --> 00:01:02,708
♫Even if you didn't see the fatal silk♫

13
00:01:02,708 --> 00:01:07,833
♫you'll be eaten by me if you fall into the web♫

14
00:01:07,833 --> 00:01:10,417
♫Deeper... inside♫

15
00:01:12,333 --> 00:01:14,583
♫Spider pride made a cruel mark♫

16
00:01:14,583 --> 00:01:17,000
♫in this chest again♫

17
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,167
♫Finding the perfect way isn't enough♫

18
00:01:19,167 --> 00:01:21,583
♫The shredded life must be reformed♫

19
00:01:21,583 --> 00:01:24,000
♫Think desperately♫

20
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,250
♫Fight desperately♫

21
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:28,542
♫The so-called reality. Feel a bit cold♫

22
00:01:28,542 --> 00:01:31,292
♫Keep living the spider way♫

23
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:40,417
♫Keep living the spider way♫

24
00:01:41,625 --> 00:01:42,625
♫Wait and see♫

25
00:01:42,625 --> 00:01:48,125
SO I'M A SPIDER, SO WHAT?

26
00:02:02,625 --> 00:02:04,500
What a scary guy.

27
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,333
The person in charge of magic No.1 and No.2.

28
00:02:06,333 --> 00:02:07,250
Roger!

29
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:08,667
Here I come!

30
00:02:09,292 --> 00:02:12,042
Charge!

31
00:02:16,458 --> 00:02:18,708
Although it was hit a little,

32
00:02:18,708 --> 00:02:21,875
according to Araba's HP value,
that was just abrasions.

33
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:25,000
It will heal automatically very quickly.

34
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,750
No killer attack... for now.

35
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:33,792
That's why I thought Araba is an opponent
that I must defeat with all my heart.

36
00:02:35,167 --> 00:02:36,292
Here it comes.

37
00:02:40,375 --> 00:02:43,250
Sorry for the sneak attack when you're shooting.

38
00:02:45,458 --> 00:02:47,208
Take this!

39
00:02:51,542 --> 00:02:52,333
Very well.

40
00:02:56,417 --> 00:02:57,625
Magic?

41
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,958
Shooting war is just what I want.

42
00:03:08,667 --> 00:03:09,500
So quick.

43
00:03:14,375 --> 00:03:16,292
How can I escape this?

44
00:03:17,083 --> 00:03:20,292
Irregular shooting is a foul!

45
00:03:23,042 --> 00:03:24,667
Oh no!

46
00:03:32,792 --> 00:03:34,917
Close combat doesn't work.

47
00:03:34,917 --> 00:03:37,333
Distant combat isn't beneficial either.

48
00:03:37,792 --> 00:03:39,083
Curse you.

49
00:03:39,083 --> 00:03:43,458
I've been using various Evil Eyes
but none of them worked.

50
00:03:44,292 --> 00:03:48,583
Only Destructive Evil Eye isn't used yet.

51
00:03:48,583 --> 00:03:51,583
Using that corrosive skill may hurt my eye.

52
00:03:51,583 --> 00:03:53,500
I should only use it when it's really necessary.

53
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,833
I'm found.

54
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:13,667
The nest built beforehand.

55
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:19,500
But it managed to stop its action.
The result is quite good.

56
00:04:20,416 --> 00:04:22,833
Venom Synthesis.

57
00:04:31,542 --> 00:04:33,625
Take this!

58
00:04:33,625 --> 00:04:36,250
Venom waterfall.

59
00:04:39,542 --> 00:04:42,625
Isn't my venom delicious?

60
00:04:48,167 --> 00:04:50,500
There are holes all over the spider web.

61
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,833
I must fix this first...

62
00:04:58,833 --> 00:05:00,083
or not.

63
00:05:00,083 --> 00:05:01,375
This is never ending.

64
00:05:01,375 --> 00:05:06,042
This is not only for repairing.

65
00:05:12,042 --> 00:05:14,583
Its precaution is right.

66
00:05:14,583 --> 00:05:20,333
No matter how great he is,
it's hard for him to escape these silks.

67
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:23,625
Your precaution is just to my liking.

68
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,625
Welcome! Sorry for the wait.

69
00:05:39,375 --> 00:05:41,667
What is this?

70
00:05:47,167 --> 00:05:48,625
Too late.

71
00:05:53,792 --> 00:05:55,292
I knew this will happen.

72
00:06:05,292 --> 00:06:07,667
Delusional pain of Gaido magic.

73
00:06:07,667 --> 00:06:12,250
Although it can't cause harm,
it can cause one to feel pain.

74
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:16,750
But for you, who can greatly reduce pain,

75
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:18,958
this should be a long-lost pain, right?

76
00:06:23,458 --> 00:06:25,458
The catch is complete.

77
00:06:25,458 --> 00:06:29,375
It will attack
with self-harm consciousness soon.

78
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:31,333
However, before that...

79
00:06:35,167 --> 00:06:38,208
I will use all the magic to attack you.

80
00:06:52,708 --> 00:06:56,250
Although I knew it will use
spurting attack to escape,

81
00:07:02,042 --> 00:07:04,167
I didn't expect...

82
00:07:04,167 --> 00:07:04,667
MAGIC OF FIRE. LEVEL 10.

83
00:07:04,667 --> 00:07:05,208
MAGIC OF FLAME. LEVEL 10.

84
00:07:05,208 --> 00:07:05,708
MAGIC OF INFERNO. LEVEL ONE.

85
00:07:05,708 --> 00:07:06,333
FLAME ENHANCEMENT. LEVEL ONE.

86
00:07:06,333 --> 00:07:07,417
FIRE RESISTANCE. LEVEL ONE.
ANTI-DARKNESS. LEVEL ONE.

87
00:07:07,417 --> 00:07:08,542
SPATIAL PERCEPTION

88
00:07:08,875 --> 00:07:13,375
It obtained skills to fight against me.

89
00:07:13,375 --> 00:07:18,250
My weakness. The highest level of
Magic of Flame and Fire Resistance.

90
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:21,250
And the countermeasure for Teleport.

91
00:07:22,167 --> 00:07:25,500
Although I've met opponents who plan strategies,

92
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:28,583
they have never been so perfect.

93
00:07:28,583 --> 00:07:33,667
There were more than 40,000
and now only 100 left.

94
00:07:33,667 --> 00:07:38,833
It has used up almost all the skill points
he collected over a long time

95
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:42,125
just to fight me alone.

96
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:50,042
This is not good.

97
00:07:50,042 --> 00:07:50,875
However,

98
00:07:50,875 --> 00:07:55,792
that means Araba recognises me as an opponent.

99
00:07:55,792 --> 00:07:59,917
So I have to try my best
to respond to your expectation.

100
00:08:08,125 --> 00:08:10,875
Okay. What should I do?

101
00:08:22,875 --> 00:08:26,958
How could it turn
the world upside down so easily?

102
00:08:26,958 --> 00:08:28,250
This is too much!

103
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:31,250
What's the point of me
choosing to fight in a hole?

104
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:32,750
Since its body is on fire,

105
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:35,625
can I just run away and destroy myself?

106
00:08:37,832 --> 00:08:40,666
Yes, even self-healing has been strengthened.

107
00:08:40,667 --> 00:08:42,457
Almost unscathed.

108
00:08:42,457 --> 00:08:44,417
This is cheating! Cheating!

109
00:08:51,708 --> 00:08:52,917
This should end now.

110
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:57,583
Below is the hell of flame.
I can only go upwards.

111
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:05,083
Proficiency achieved a certain target.

112
00:09:05,083 --> 00:09:11,250
Level-ten Speed Thinking upgraded
to level-one High-Speed Thinking.

113
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:15,833
Level-ten Foresight upgraded
to level-one Future Sight.

114
00:09:15,833 --> 00:09:17,708
Very good. However...

115
00:09:20,167 --> 00:09:25,333
My level-upgrade is a good thing,
but it also obtained new skills.

116
00:09:25,333 --> 00:09:27,958
If we both keep growing, this will have no end.

117
00:09:34,042 --> 00:09:36,083
It even obtained anti-Gaido characteristic.

118
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:40,042
Gaido magic is useless against it.
It's safer to think that.

119
00:09:46,708 --> 00:09:48,917
Oh no. Is that the ceiling?

120
00:09:51,042 --> 00:09:53,292
I've been forced into a dead end.

121
00:09:53,292 --> 00:09:56,667
Is escaping through
the scorching hell the only way?

122
00:09:58,625 --> 00:10:00,375
Aren't you an earth dragon?

123
00:10:00,375 --> 00:10:04,917
How can you use flame
like a fire dragon so easily?

124
00:10:08,792 --> 00:10:12,458
Hot! It's burning!

125
00:10:12,917 --> 00:10:14,292
Medicine Synthesis!

126
00:10:18,083 --> 00:10:20,333
This is the medicine version of Venom Synthesis.

127
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:24,458
I didn't expect to use this to extinguish fire
while fighting against Araba.

128
00:10:27,542 --> 00:10:29,375
I can only go.

129
00:10:41,083 --> 00:10:42,417
What is this?

130
00:10:42,417 --> 00:10:45,625
This is too difficult.

131
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:48,917
I can't do anything.
But I will die if I don't do anything.

132
00:10:48,917 --> 00:10:49,875
Hot!

133
00:10:52,167 --> 00:10:57,083
If I'm distracted by the spurting attack
and fragments, I'll be swallowed by flames.

134
00:10:57,083 --> 00:10:58,708
I must distinguish the fire quickly...

135
00:10:59,917 --> 00:11:02,000
Cursed you. It's so tricky.

136
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,167
If I'm hit directly, I'll be dead.

137
00:11:05,167 --> 00:11:06,417
Right there!

138
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:09,500
Oh... no!

139
00:11:21,875 --> 00:11:25,583
I have no choice now. Let's perish together.

140
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,167
Destructive Evil Eye!

141
00:11:31,083 --> 00:11:32,292
My eye!

142
00:11:35,667 --> 00:11:41,333
Cursed you! Even if I can't shoot silks,
it's better than being dead.

143
00:11:55,333 --> 00:11:57,042
I'm getting closer to the ground.

144
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,750
Now is the worst situation
at the moment of life and death.

145
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:04,375
Only by staying in the air, I can try to fight.

146
00:12:04,375 --> 00:12:08,250
Even when sticking on the wall just now
I ended up in a miserable situation.

147
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:11,750
If I fight it on the ground,
I will be dead in an instant.

148
00:12:13,875 --> 00:12:19,583
My only choice is to go over
the angry Araba and reach its head.

149
00:12:21,625 --> 00:12:25,458
Although it's difficult, I have to do it.

150
00:12:32,542 --> 00:12:34,250
It's hot...

151
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:39,333
But I won't be burnt to death, right?

152
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:41,917
Short-distance teleporting.

153
00:12:41,917 --> 00:12:43,917
Okay. Keep going up like this...

154
00:12:53,708 --> 00:12:55,250
I'm torn.

155
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:58,500
It used Spatial Perception
to find my teleporting destination.

156
00:12:59,417 --> 00:13:05,708
Oh no! If this goes on,
my MP value will be used up soon.

157
00:13:06,292 --> 00:13:09,417
Take this! Corrosive attack!

158
00:13:18,042 --> 00:13:19,542
Medicine Synthesis!

159
00:13:27,708 --> 00:13:30,542
I must move quickly.

160
00:13:31,458 --> 00:13:33,458
Oh... no!

161
00:13:34,375 --> 00:13:39,833
If I'm hit by such attacks,
I will disappear with my ash.

162
00:13:39,833 --> 00:13:41,958
Is that it?

163
00:13:41,958 --> 00:13:47,333
You've done good enough.
You fought Araba up to this point.

164
00:13:48,083 --> 00:13:49,250
There's no regret...

165
00:13:53,167 --> 00:13:54,500
Or not!

166
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,292
This is not over yet. Before the last...

167
00:13:57,292 --> 00:14:00,667
Before the last minute arrives,
I will not give up.

168
00:14:03,417 --> 00:14:09,042
When it uses spurting attack,
I will use Destructive Evil Eye.

169
00:14:44,875 --> 00:14:47,458
It's finally the time.

170
00:14:47,458 --> 00:14:50,833
The destroying skill brewed
from the beginning until now,

171
00:14:55,583 --> 00:14:57,042
Indolence.

172
00:14:57,042 --> 00:15:00,125
INDOLENCE CAN SPEED UP THE DEPLETION
OF ABILITY VALUES OF OTHER CREATURES.

173
00:15:03,417 --> 00:15:07,417
I won. It's helpless now.

174
00:15:13,458 --> 00:15:19,375
The key to victory of this battle
is to make it use up its SP value.

175
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:24,333
I didn't plan on depleting Araba's HP value.

176
00:15:26,542 --> 00:15:31,292
The abnormal state is useless against it.
Its physical and magical resistances are strong.

177
00:15:31,292 --> 00:15:33,000
And it can dodge very well.

178
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,542
Besides, its automatic recovery
is too fast to deplete its HP value.

179
00:15:38,208 --> 00:15:40,458
What can I do?

180
00:15:43,958 --> 00:15:50,208
Indolence can speed up the depletion
of HP, MP and SP values of opponents.

181
00:15:50,208 --> 00:15:51,625
This is it!

182
00:15:54,708 --> 00:16:01,042
Unlike HP and MP values,
SP value can't recover automatically.

183
00:16:01,042 --> 00:16:05,875
Besides, without SP value,
a living creature will die.

184
00:16:05,875 --> 00:16:10,917
Araba used various skills
to fight the inferior me.

185
00:16:10,917 --> 00:16:16,750
But it didn't know I've took this into account
and was splurging its SP value.

186
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:20,958
If it behaved more leisurely
and reserved during the battle,

187
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:23,083
the result might be different.

188
00:16:27,917 --> 00:16:30,458
Even with strong defense and resistance,

189
00:16:30,458 --> 00:16:34,708
it's impossible
to endure magic without defense, right?

190
00:16:34,708 --> 00:16:41,125
How does it feel to be driven into desperation
by a small potato you looked down upon?

191
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:47,792
I want to beat you and retrieve my pride here,
where I was psychologically traumatised.

192
00:16:52,458 --> 00:16:57,458
It's impossible. Its SP value has been used up.

193
00:16:57,458 --> 00:16:59,250
Look.

194
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:01,958
What kind of look is that?

195
00:17:01,958 --> 00:17:05,166
You lost to me.

196
00:17:05,166 --> 00:17:08,541
You should look more unwilling.

197
00:17:08,541 --> 00:17:10,207
How can this be?

198
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,541
What kind of joke is this?

199
00:17:18,541 --> 00:17:21,332
Why do you look so satisfied?

200
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:25,875
Because you tried your best,
so you don't regret it at all?

201
00:17:25,875 --> 00:17:29,042
Why did you give up so easily?

202
00:17:29,042 --> 00:17:31,625
You should be greedier.

203
00:17:31,625 --> 00:17:34,542
Beg for your life!

204
00:17:34,542 --> 00:17:36,625
Try everything to live!

205
00:17:36,625 --> 00:17:40,458
Although I reincarnated once,
what I said is perhaps not persuasive.

206
00:17:40,458 --> 00:17:43,625
Normally, when you're dead, it's over.

207
00:17:45,958 --> 00:17:47,667
Why...

208
00:17:47,667 --> 00:17:50,042
Why did you so easily...

209
00:17:50,042 --> 00:17:53,833
give up on your life?

210
00:17:53,833 --> 00:17:57,500
Then me who struggles
because I don't want this to end,

211
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:04,250
who desperate to seize the gleam of life...
Who am I then?

212
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,708
Araba!

213
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:26,667
Experience achieved a certain target.

214
00:18:26,667 --> 00:18:30,875
Level 25 is upgraded to level 29.

215
00:18:33,042 --> 00:18:35,625
I defeated my all-time enemy, Araba.

216
00:18:35,625 --> 00:18:38,917
There's no doubt that I defeated it myself.

217
00:18:38,917 --> 00:18:42,958
But why is my mood is horrible?

218
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:50,833
I will never forget this annoying mood.

219
00:18:53,792 --> 00:18:57,625
Hey, Balto.
Have you encountered a dragon before?

220
00:18:57,625 --> 00:19:02,958
No. I've encountered inferior dragons
but not superior dragons.

221
00:19:04,083 --> 00:19:06,292
I thought so too.

222
00:19:06,292 --> 00:19:08,875
Why did you come up with this topic?

223
00:19:08,875 --> 00:19:12,000
I was just thinking about the past.

224
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,417
I've even fought an earth dragon.

225
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:21,125
You're really powerful.
You even fought an earth dragon.

226
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:28,833
Earth dragons are very arrogant.

227
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:32,708
They definitely have Warrior's blood in them.

228
00:19:32,708 --> 00:19:34,042
Warrior?

229
00:19:34,042 --> 00:19:37,042
Don't mind me. I'm just talking to myself.

230
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:41,708
I've encountered various types of dragons.

231
00:19:41,708 --> 00:19:46,625
Now that I think of it,
earth dragons are the most outstanding ones.

232
00:19:59,167 --> 00:20:03,167
Is the girl in white who beat brother the Devil?

233
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,458
She could turn humans to ash. This is just...

234
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:13,875
I will definitely avenge my brother.

235
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:23,500
Shun.

236
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:30,667
Brother.

237
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:39,042
Shun.

238
00:20:46,417 --> 00:20:50,042
Schlain... Wait for it.

239
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:16,292
I wanted to follow
the humans I marked to find the exit...

240
00:21:16,292 --> 00:21:17,708
Is that it?

241
00:21:19,375 --> 00:21:21,625
Yes. It's the exit!

242
00:21:22,708 --> 00:21:26,458
Now that I think of it,
I've experienced a lot in this labyrinth.

243
00:21:26,458 --> 00:21:29,750
There are good and bad memories.

244
00:21:30,292 --> 00:21:35,417
No. I only remember the fact
that I struggled to survive.

245
00:21:35,417 --> 00:21:38,583
But I indeed survived.

246
00:21:38,583 --> 00:21:40,542
I even defeated Araba.

247
00:21:40,542 --> 00:21:44,208
I have no nostalgia for this dark labyrinth.

248
00:21:44,208 --> 00:21:47,208
From today on, under the bright sky,

249
00:21:47,208 --> 00:21:51,167
a bright and absurd spider life

250
00:21:51,167 --> 00:21:53,208
will be waiting for me!

251
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:55,917
Yohoo!

252
00:22:09,208 --> 00:22:10,458
Do you know? This is the prelude.

253
00:22:10,458 --> 00:22:12,750
The life of a spider.

254
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:14,333
I'm going to start singing.
