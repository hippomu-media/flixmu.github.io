1
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:06,790
Fall into ranks!

2
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:08,610
The king is actually here in person.

3
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:15,410
You all look impressive.

4
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:20,120
Just by looking at you, I have faith
that you can complete this mission.

5
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:24,380
I'm looking forward to your performance.

6
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:43,290
Yes, we'll do whatever it takes!

7
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:44,820
We're already considered lucky

8
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:49,370
to have found the carriage?

9
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:52,920
Darn it!

10
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:54,090
We're just here...

11
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:57,630
to seek revenge.

12
00:00:58,990 --> 00:01:01,850
I've let...

13
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:07,390
I've let the king down.

14
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:19,270
I'm too ashamed.

15
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:25,070
How will the king punish us
when he gets the report of our failure?

16
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:28,360
Let's return and await punishment.

17
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:38,670
The king? No.

18
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:42,640
The one punishing you...

19
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,120
has to be me.

20
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:51,759
You're still alive?

21
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:54,539
Ms. Kahabell and the soldiers are dead.

22
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:56,750
The other two warriors fell into the cave.

23
00:01:56,890 --> 00:01:58,229
That's the truth.

24
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:03,270
Yotsuya converting to the Altros religion
is false.

25
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:06,640
It can't be! Which part...

26
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:09,190
Which part is a lie?

27
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:12,030
Pick up your weapon.

28
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:21,980
Let me tell you something.

29
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,870
The three Altrosians are still alive.

30
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:30,450
The one in black
that was burned alive,

31
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,160
was your subordinate.

32
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:56,900
Say your last words.

33
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:08,060
I only...

34
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:11,780
I only want world peace!

35
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:16,370
I only want world peace!

36
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Do you?

37
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:26,360
You traded for peace
with my comrade's life?

38
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:33,980
Well, it's only fair that
we trade your lives for peace.

39
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:49,850
I'M STANDING ON A MILLION LIVES

40
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:54,660
The strange routine in front of me

41
00:03:54,829 --> 00:03:58,620
Stepping out of common sense

42
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:07,810
Cutting off the comforting link
to look for the true light

43
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:12,580
My back is against the wall,
I can't give in

44
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:17,190
(Be tough, don't cry, keep going)

45
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:20,660
The reality is a matter of life or death

46
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:25,080
The enthusiasm within my heart
(surviving in despair)

47
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:29,450
Entering the spiritual world
(fearless, striving)

48
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:33,770
We were born with loneliness

49
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:38,260
Walk side by side,
and be vulnerable no more

50
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:42,790
Even in the face of life's uncertainty

51
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:46,930
The fire of life will never die

52
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:51,210
With courage in my hand, I stand strong

53
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:58,440
Fight for tomorrow

54
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:12,440
Those three men still failed in the end?

55
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:16,940
Such fools,
they should have just returned.

56
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:19,990
Should we send a rescue team?

57
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:23,620
No, only two men survived?

58
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,550
I also agree it's for the best.

59
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:34,920
The issue at hand is that the impartial
warriors are now our enemies.

60
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:38,040
Do you mean we might
go to war against the warriors?

61
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:38,900
Yes.

62
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:44,740
It's not a big deal
if stupid Kamilt offended them.

63
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:48,090
But, there's still a possibility.

64
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,650
I see.

65
00:05:49,909 --> 00:05:53,200
If so, go and figure out
how to kill the warriors.

66
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:55,920
Yes.

67
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:07,100
Without knowing the content of the report,

68
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:09,610
we can't be sure if we succeeded.

69
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,790
True.

70
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:12,870
But technically, we did.

71
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:15,280
We rescued all the prisoners.

72
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:19,770
To be honest, we haven't complete
our objective yet.

73
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:21,440
What?

74
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:24,340
Regarding the cargo,

75
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:27,330
I have three issues to handle.

76
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:29,900
Is something wrong?

77
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:33,700
Iu's team is not moving.

78
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:41,060
Cargos that need to be sent to Radorpo?

79
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:44,150
I don't have any, sorry.

80
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:45,630
I see.

81
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,690
Thank you very much.

82
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:51,600
We finally came across
traveling merchants, but...

83
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:58,370
I walked around there,
but there isn't any other store.

84
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:03,790
It's bad if we arrive
in Radorpo empty-handed.

85
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:07,850
Perhaps, it's not so.

86
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:14,160
Mr. Makua, I have a question.

87
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:15,600
What is it?

88
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:20,350
This is the last one.

89
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:24,580
Seriously, are you sure
you want to bring that with us?

90
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:27,170
This might be the cargo.

91
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:32,480
But, maybe not in the same carriage.

92
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:38,240
Look, we have a kid here.
It won't do him much good.

93
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:40,100
I don't mind.

94
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:43,130
Is there anything else I can help?

95
00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:46,520
You just woke up. Get some rest.

96
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:47,980
Sure.

97
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:51,170
He's so holy!

98
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:56,159
Gosh, there's no limit
to what little boys can do!

99
00:07:56,330 --> 00:07:57,500
So scary!

100
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:03,040
Really? Yes, maybe you've got a point.

101
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,340
If riding in the carriage
is too much for you,

102
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,770
how about we swap over
and you can drive instead?

103
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:09,300
Can I?

104
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:14,210
No, I'm fine.

105
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:15,870
Carry on talking.

106
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:23,570
Really?

107
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:28,190
Sir, you're so amazing!
I have so much respect for you.

108
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:34,980
You also healed me. I'm really grateful.

109
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,419
You're welcome.

110
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:42,549
Is anything of a concern to you?

111
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,100
No, nothing.

112
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:49,170
I'm definitely concerned.

113
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:50,820
Why did you sigh?

114
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:53,650
Could it be that...

115
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:58,660
she has feelings for him?

116
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:01,320
Does she feel lonely to be
away from him as such?

117
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,920
No way, how is it possible?

118
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:14,360
With more people in the carriage,
the horses also need to take more breaks.

119
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,990
Well, sir...

120
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:22,440
Although it has come to this...

121
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:23,220
What is it?

122
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:27,260
No...

123
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:29,140
It's nothing.

124
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,850
Was she going to profess her love?

125
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,840
That definitely felt like it!

126
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:42,370
Right,

127
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:47,330
at this speed, we'll arrive
the day after tomorrow.

128
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,720
Understood.

129
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:54,000
The journey is also coming to an end.

130
00:09:57,470 --> 00:09:59,680
What's with this whiff of sorrow?

131
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:03,580
Is she sad about parting with Yotsuya?

132
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:15,360
I can't believe someone like Ms. Kahabell
will hesitate to profess her love.

133
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:19,950
On that note, there's a similar event
in "One Star."

134
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:21,410
A HELPFUL GIRL IS CHARMING

135
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:25,960
Helping someone to confess their feelings
will gain favorability with Tsubasa.

136
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,620
I'll do my best, Tsubasa!

137
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,740
I'll make it work!

138
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:39,000
Tsubasa, Tsubasa,
you're my favorite person!

139
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:39,580
Oops, I just confessed my feelings.

140
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:41,920
Are you sure she's fine?

141
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:44,450
Why is she swaying side to side?

142
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:46,720
I wish I can see you soon, Tsubasa.

143
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:47,950
It's okay.

144
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:50,450
As players, this isn't a big deal.

145
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:51,750
I'm so happy.

146
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:55,220
I also hope to get home soon
to play my video games.

147
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,080
"MESSENGER BIRDS": ANIMALS USED TO
DELIVER LETTERS, OMNIVORE

148
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,370
HOMING ABILITY, RETURNS HOME WITHOUT FAIL

149
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:02,620
CAN DELIVER LETTERS HOME
BUT CAN'T RETURN TO THE DEPARTED LOCATION

150
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:04,000
OCCASSIONALLY THEY GET LOST
AND ARE KEPT AS PETS

151
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,070
Swap around?

152
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:11,240
Yes.

153
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:15,740
My butt hurts
from sitting on a horse for so long.

154
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:27,410
I'll call this, "One Star Special:
Boy Meets Girl."

155
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:31,640
Can I hold you before we get rescued?

156
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:36,640
A boy and a girl will surely grow closer
if they spend time alone.

157
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:38,790
That's typical in "One Star."

158
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:42,970
Sharing a carriage as
the eve of departure draws near...

159
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:47,530
Then, there's only one more thing to do.

160
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:49,670
They fell asleep?

161
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:52,350
Although you stayed up all night,

162
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:54,880
don't you have better things to do?

163
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:04,860
CHEF'S KNIFE

164
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,260
POT

165
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:13,910
Next, One Star daily activity,
working hand in hand.

166
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:19,240
You can't slice the pumpkin?
Let's do it together.

167
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:22,290
Working hand in hand will increase trust.

168
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,140
Not to mention
the heart-throbbing physical contact.

169
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:27,120
Yotsuya usually cooks alone.

170
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:29,310
Today, I should ask Ms. Kahabell to...

171
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,420
Warrior!

172
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,670
I've got the perfect prey.

173
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:38,200
We'll have a fancy lunch today!

174
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:41,500
-That's enormous! Good job.
-Impressive! That's huge!

175
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:43,550
Does that count as working hand in hand?

176
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:45,750
What about the heart-throb?

177
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:49,910
That's amazing! So cool!

178
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:51,000
Is it?

179
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:52,080
Yes, totally!

180
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:54,400
Come on, it's not a big deal.

181
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:55,940
I'm so in awe of you.

182
00:12:56,090 --> 00:12:57,570
Really? I'm glad to hear that.

183
00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:00,710
Since the straightforward strategy
didn't work,

184
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:03,360
let's opt for the violent strategy.

185
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:09,350
Do we have to start training at noon?

186
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:15,620
But... we won't get to train with
Ms. Kahabell soon.

187
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:17,800
Let's just say it will help
with digestion.

188
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:19,430
Here we go!

189
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:24,900
The most controversial strategy
in the history of One Star.

190
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:30,160
Engrave my mood into your heart
and turn it into a scar that never fades!

191
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:35,520
Just like the most controversial character
in One Star, Snake Fangs.

192
00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:38,860
Ms. Kahabell should completely

193
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:41,740
engrave her love on Yotsuya!

194
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:45,760
Some love can only be expressed
through fighting.

195
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:47,690
Ms. Kahabell!

196
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:50,680
Although violence isn't my thing,

197
00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:52,560
it might actually...

198
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,560
Well, next.

199
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:00,450
No, it's not about me!

200
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:03,790
Warrior, you brought this up.

201
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:05,750
No, I don't want to be cut!

202
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:07,000
Just once, I'll be gentle.

203
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:09,060
Yotsuya, don't just stand there!

204
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:13,750
It's way harder than I thought.

205
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:19,870
Tsubasa, console me, Tsubasa!

206
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:21,930
Is she really fine?

207
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:23,960
Well, I don't know either.

208
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:27,000
Since there's already a flag
for the character,

209
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,570
the corresponding event to
retrieve the flag should happen!

210
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:32,400
Why is it that nothing happened?

211
00:14:33,090 --> 00:14:36,230
What a strange setting? Stupid game!

212
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:37,500
Why aren't there more
handsome male characters?

213
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:40,000
She's complaining, I think she'll be fine.

214
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:40,660
Characters that would call me Miss.

215
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:42,700
She still has the strength to be angry.

216
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:44,750
Stupid game! Take a look as One Star,
and then take a look at yourself!

217
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:47,960
That's impressive.

218
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:50,560
Kusue, luckily, you've noticed it.

219
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:55,990
There should also be couriers
in this world.

220
00:14:57,450 --> 00:15:02,300
Yes, we only thought of merchants
due to our conception of this world.

221
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:07,290
However, if you think carefully,
couriers are in charge of deliveries.

222
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:09,260
What's more, we're really lucky.

223
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:12,770
They only deliver once a month
and it happens to be today.

224
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,500
Here he comes.

225
00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:19,660
He has cargos with him. It can't be wrong.

226
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:24,390
Cargos that need to be delivered
to Radorpo? I do have some.

227
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:25,750
Wonderful.

228
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:29,310
If you don't mind,
please let us escort you to Radorpo.

229
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,980
I don't mind, but...

230
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:34,320
Wait a second.

231
00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:36,600
Even if you're warriors,

232
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:39,570
you can't sabotage my business?

233
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:42,750
It's a matter of life and death

234
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,280
In this case,

235
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:47,980
it can't be helped.

236
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:01,590
What can't be helped?

237
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:13,090
All my efforts were wasted.

238
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:17,710
Doesn't Ms. Kahabell's flag
get a corresponding event?

239
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:35,930
Warrior, can I have a word with you?

240
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:37,930
Sure.

241
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:47,790
You can't sleep?

242
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,700
It's not that.

243
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:54,260
Yes, it is.

244
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:01,380
Warrior...

245
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:05,109
Well, I've wanted to...

246
00:17:06,589 --> 00:17:10,560
I've wanted to say something to you.

247
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:12,400
Okay.

248
00:17:18,819 --> 00:17:19,910
Thank you.

249
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:26,410
You gave me the chance
to avenge Bimzberg.

250
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:31,050
I'm truly grateful for that.

251
00:17:31,770 --> 00:17:35,080
It's nothing. I was also very angry then.

252
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:41,490
I've been meaning to say that

253
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,960
but once the timing was off,
I found it hard to tell you.

254
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:49,790
I feel so much better.
Now, I can finally sleep with ease.

255
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:56,940
She has such great manners.

256
00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:01,950
That was what she wanted to say?

257
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:04,690
Don't mislead me!

258
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:12,330
Are you sure I can put that cargo
on your carriage?

259
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:16,870
Yes, we'll get it delivered.
Please rest assured.

260
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:20,000
It's such an honor
to travel with the warriors.

261
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:22,120
I'll do my best to learn from you.

262
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:24,420
His attitude is totally different.
How scary.

263
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:27,670
Don't worry about it. Let's go!

264
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:38,420
We'll be able to arrive in Radorpo
by today.

265
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,990
Let's go through what
we'll do when we arrive.

266
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:46,650
We have three cargos. The first is,

267
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,600
the three death row prisoners.

268
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:52,610
Bring them to the church
that can protect them,

269
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,670
and we might clear the stage.

270
00:18:55,850 --> 00:18:56,660
QUEST: EXPLORE 5% OF THE MAP
(4.83% COMPLETED)

271
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:57,750
DELIVER CARGO TO RADORPO
REMAINING TIME: 1 DAY 15 HOURS

272
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:03,620
If not, there's the second cargo.

273
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:06,620
Belongings of the dead soldiers.

274
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:10,050
We can either sell them or give them away.

275
00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:12,860
That might also be considered a cargo.

276
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:14,290
QUEST: EXPLORE 5% OF THE MAP
(4.83% COMPLETED)

277
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:15,250
DELIVER CARGO TO RADORPO
REMAINING TIME: 1 DAY 14 HOURS

278
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:20,660
And the third cargo...

279
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:24,480
That's it.

280
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,460
At this pace, we should arrive in time.

281
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:37,780
But, do we just have to
deliver this cargo?

282
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:40,030
If that's all it takes to clear this stage,

283
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:44,160
it's way too easy.
Why did we go to all that trouble?

284
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:44,910
QUEST: EXPLORE 5% OF THE MAP
(4.83% COMPLETED)

285
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:45,290
DELIVER CARGO TO RADORPO
REMAINING TIME: 1 DAY 13 HOURS

286
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:48,500
Besides, there's still one more quest.

287
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:52,600
Judging by our pace, we're also
really tight on that quest.

288
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:57,110
Cleared?

289
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:02,630
Cleared.

290
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:06,280
So that was it.

291
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:16,700
The Deock Empire committed
such cruel deeds.

292
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:20,510
If you need more evidence
that what we've given you,

293
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:24,740
you can go to the church.
All the victims are there.

294
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:26,880
Understood.

295
00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:32,180
Thank you for providing information
and interrupting their plan.

296
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:35,570
Although these count as evidence,

297
00:20:35,810 --> 00:20:38,390
please don't deliver more heads here.

298
00:20:47,170 --> 00:20:50,840
I can't believe that the soldiers' heads
are the correct answer.

299
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:55,230
I suppose that fits
the definition of cargo.

300
00:20:55,670 --> 00:20:59,080
But anyway, I think the game master
is the one who has the final say in it.

301
00:21:02,690 --> 00:21:05,040
Finally! We see each other again!

302
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:11,550
Anyway, the first quest is completed.

303
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:12,650
Good job!

304
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:15,530
Next, let's finish exploring the map.

305
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:18,400
We still have a day and a half to go.

306
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,270
Well then,

307
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:20,820
let's split up.

308
00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:29,680
What's that?

309
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:34,040
It feels like being rejected
before even confessing my feelings.

310
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:40,040
EPISODE 9, SIGNING OUT FROM A RACING HEART

311
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:55,060
In the shiny world

312
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:57,980
Embracing the moment

313
00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:00,810
In the shiny world

314
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:03,780
Now, now, now

315
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,620
How can I become stronger

316
00:22:06,810 --> 00:22:09,540
The reason why I always feel lost

317
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:11,160
Now, now, now

318
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:14,690
Memories sparkle

319
00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:18,410
If I could become you or somebody else

320
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:21,250
Flying birds

321
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,830
Now, now, now

322
00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:26,350
Must share the same wishes

323
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:34,540
Even though all the "ifs" come true

324
00:22:34,610 --> 00:22:37,790
I won't be me again

325
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:44,770
Write down your dream and my name

326
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:47,630
On the beach with an hour hand

327
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:49,630
It'll disappear soon

328
00:22:49,850 --> 00:22:56,470
Even so, I want to be me for once

329
00:22:56,670 --> 00:22:59,330
Unpredictable future

330
00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:02,410
Moving forward with you

331
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:05,340
In the shiny world

332
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:05,910
Embracing the moment

TO: YOTSUYA YUSUKE

335
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,970
Do you really think this will work?

336
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:34,520
I mean,

337
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:35,750
let's split up.

338
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,440
No, but we were never together!

339
00:23:37,690 --> 00:23:39,100
Why are you shooting on location?
