1
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:43,660
That's quite a walk.


2
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:45,230
How much is left?


3
00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:46,750
QUEST: EXPLORE 5% OF THE MAP
(4.96% COMPLETED)


4
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:47,980
It's looking good.


5
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,640
In the fourth week,
the game master gave us two quests.


6
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:55,080
One, deliver cargo to Radorpo.


7
00:00:55,750 --> 00:01:00,040
Tokitate and I handed in the heads
of the Deock soldiers


8
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,030
and completed the quest.


9
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:08,680
As a special detachment, Shindo and
Hakozaki, later rejoined us in Radorpo.


10
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:11,770
Anyway, the first quest is completed.


11
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:12,860
Good job.


12
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:15,430
Next, we just need to
finish exploring the map.


13
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:17,710
Time remaining, a day and a half.


14
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:19,750
Well then...


15
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:20,940
Let's split up!


16
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,330
The other quest is
to explore five percent of the map.


17
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,920
To increase efficiency, all of us
split up to explore alone.


18
00:01:35,539 --> 00:01:38,370
At this pace, we should clear
the stage very soon.


19
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:39,210
Great!


20
00:01:43,789 --> 00:01:44,539
Snow?


21
00:01:53,120 --> 00:02:02,830
I'M STANDING ON A MILLION LIVES


22
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:07,660
The strange routine in front of me


23
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:11,600
Stepping out of common sense


24
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:20,790
Cutting off the comforting link
to look for the true light


25
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:25,579
My back is against the wall,
I can't give in


26
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:30,170
(Be tough, don't cry, keep going)


27
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:33,620
The reality is a matter of life or death


28
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:38,079
The enthusiasm within my heart
(surviving in despair)


29
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:42,410
Entering the spiritual world
(fearless, striving)


30
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:46,750
We were born with loneliness


31
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:51,240
Walk side by side,
and be vulnerable no more


32
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:55,790
Even in the face of life's uncertainty


33
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:59,910
The fire of life will never die


34
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:04,190
With courage in my hand, I stand strong


35
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:11,420
Fight for tomorrow


36
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:02,560
Isn't it better to postpone the departure?


37
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:07,140
The locals said
that there will be blizzards at night.


38
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:10,720
It's said to be the unique climate
specific to this area.


39
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:11,980
I see.


40
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,780
Do you think the warriors will be fine?


41
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:18,410
They say that the blizzard is worse
in the mountains.


42
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,800
So here you are.


43
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:34,350
Ms. Kahabell.


44
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:42,830
Are you heading out now?


45
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:45,500
Our quest is not completed yet.


46
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:49,310
So, I guess this is goodbye.


47
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:50,590
I guess so.


48
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:54,120
Well done. Thanks for your help.


49
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:57,850
Sure.


50
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:04,520
Well, take care, Ms. Kahabell.


51
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:13,480
Farewell, the lone wolf warrior.


52
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:27,890
Captain. Captain?


53
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,530
What's wrong?


54
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:33,140
Oh, I'm... fine.


55
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:35,130
Let's postpone our departure.


56
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:37,659
Get a good rest before
we head back to our country.


57
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:40,930
Makua, you need to get clean up.


58
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,300
Yes. Thank you, Captain.


59
00:05:54,909 --> 00:05:56,680
"Is this where my life ends?"


60
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:00,110
"Am I going to die a nobody?"


61
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:03,570
Those were my thoughts at that moment.


62
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:09,010
But now, it seems I'll continue
with my battles.


63
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:13,970
I'm a knight. I belong to the battlefield.


64
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:17,150
That was...


65
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:20,610
just a moment's impulse.


66
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:27,410
Warriors, please be safe.


67
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:37,000
I'll use this.


68
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,250
I can also choose from these ones.


69
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:48,830
I can use multiple objects,
one over another. This is great.


70
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:52,570
Luckily, I've changed my occupation.


71
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:58,610
No, this is not looking good at all.


72
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:01,130
I thought we only had to
walk around the place.


73
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:04,230
There's actually this setup?


74
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,760
On that note...


75
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:07,140
Are you kidding me?


76
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:11,860
Darn it. It's getting darker
and the temperature is dropping.


77
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:16,770
This is... I might freeze to death?


78
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:20,740
By the way, if I freeze to death here,
will I be revived?


79
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:22,070
No.


80
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:26,160
When Shindo and Hakozaki were devoured
by the troll,


81
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,230
they couldn't be revived.


82
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:32,980
In other words, you can't revive
in a deadly environment.


83
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,040
If I freeze to death here,


84
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:39,450
my body temperature will drop
to a fatal point once I'm revived.


85
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:43,940
I'll do some high knee runs
to get my body temperature up.


86
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,240
It feels good.


87
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,980
This is really terrible.


88
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:04,580
A blizzard out of nowhere
is not fun at all.


89
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,670
You could at least send me
a handsome dude.


90
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:09,320
Give me my Prince Charming!


91
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:13,510
Two people stranded by the blizzard,


92
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,640
staying close to keep each other warm.


93
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:24,620
I need an ecstatic storyline!


94
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:28,630
Sorry, I'm sorry.


95
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:34,789
By the way, will everyone be able
to keep going in this weather?


96
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:37,140
Could they be taking a break?


97
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:38,370
QUEST: EXPLORE 5% OF THE MAP
(4.98% COMPLETED)


98
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:39,110
Seriously?


99
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:43,030
Won't this reveal that
I'm the only one slacking off?


100
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,540
It's so cold...


101
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:50,100
If I stop, I'll die for sure?


102
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:52,680
Cold... It's so cold!


103
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,440
Think about seeing Tsubasa...


104
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:11,860
I feel terrible.


105
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:15,980
It's as if my heart is going
to be ripped apart but...


106
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:18,430
I've made up my mind.


107
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,860
When I came to this world, I...


108
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:24,370
Hakozaki Kusue.


109
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:29,840
Warrior (sword).


110
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:33,850
Wonderful!


111
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,380
Here comes a warrior!


112
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:38,960
I finally have a companion.


113
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,290
Nice to meet you, Kusue.


114
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,490
Well...


115
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:52,030
You must be so confused now,
but anyway, let's do this!


116
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:55,050
I'll also do my best to help you.


117
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,480
Likewise.


118
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:00,480
Please take care of me.


119
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:05,090
When I came to this world,
I was actually quite pleased.


120
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:09,400
Although it's been frightening,


121
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:14,330
I've been given a healthy body
to travel with everyone.


122
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:15,930
More importantly...


123
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:19,090
We finally won.


124
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:22,800
Sorry, I didn't do anything.


125
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:26,070
No, it's all right.


126
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:28,870
I'm really glad that the second player
is someone I knew well.


127
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,510
Right now, even this is...


128
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:33,290
Shindo?


129
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:37,560
Sorry, do you mind
if I stay like this for a while?


130
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:41,100
No, not at all.


131
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:47,770
I'm so happy that someone like me
can actually help others.


132
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:52,860
Even if it's just a little bit,
it's what I've never been able to do.


133
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,560
As long as I can help others,


134
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,120
I'll never give up.


135
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,830
"MAP": GEOGRAPHIC DATA WITHIN 50M RADIUS
OF THE PLAYER'S LOCATION WILL BE RECORDED


136
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
ALL OBTAINED DATA WILL BE KEPT
EVEN AFTER A QUEST IS COMPLETED


137
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,950
CHANGES TO THE TOWNS AND TOPOGRAPHY
MAY OCCUR AS TIME GOES BY


138
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,280
So cold...


139
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:30,160
Basically, I haven't stopped walking
since yesterday


140
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:33,370
but now, I've run into a blizzard.
This is ridiculous.


141
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:38,590
Even as the fourth week's quest,
it's way too difficult.


142
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,900
It's so quiet.


143
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:57,470
Speaking of which, I haven't been
alone in this world for a long time.


144
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,410
What do you mean?


145
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:04,000
Please complete this quest.


146
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,200
QUEST
ELIMINATE 1 GOBLIN (TIME LIMIT: 3 DAYS)


147
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:06,930
Where am I?


148
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:08,600
What about that girls I was with?


149
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:10,230
Where are my friends?


150
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:13,980
You're alone here, without friends.


151
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:18,220
When I came to this world,


152
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:21,290
everything that I've worked for


153
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,800
was taken from me.


154
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:28,250
My companions are always my friends.


155
00:12:30,090 --> 00:12:33,440
Companions mean strength,
that's what I've learned.


156
00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:37,950
As long as I'm needed by others,


157
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:40,970
I won't end up like that.


158
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,840
That's why I've worked so hard.


159
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:49,270
The world that I live in,


160
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:53,230
can only be shaped with my own hands.


161
00:12:58,490 --> 00:13:01,630
I've finally had what
I worked so hard for.


162
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:10,480
However, in a split second...


163
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:17,250
I was really sad at that time. However...


164
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:22,060
I... I don't want to die
in such a terrible world.


165
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:24,870
I'd never...


166
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,360
So, Yotsuya...


167
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,940
please help me out,
I have nothing in this world.


168
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,980
Help me.


169
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:41,270
I was really desperate then.


170
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:42,720
But,


171
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,840
I can still keep going.


172
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:07,280
I mustn't die in such a place!


173
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:22,830
So heavy... My arms and legs... are numb.


174
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:25,050
But I have to keep going.


175
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:27,760
Where am I?


176
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:29,790
How far are we?


177
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:34,070
QUEST: EXPLORE 5% OF THE MAP
(4.991% COMPLETED)


178
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:38,300
Great, we're making progress.


179
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:40,970
Almost there...


180
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,780
Why? No...


181
00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:02,740
I don't want to give up.


182
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:05,420
No...


183
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:11,490
I don't want to die in such a place.


184
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:25,760
What's going on?


185
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:37,650
Why is it so?


186
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:40,350
Are you kidding me?


187
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:46,370
This is really bad!


188
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:49,090
This is really getting serious.


189
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:49,500
QUEST: EXPLORE 5% OF THE MAP
(4.992% COMPLETED)


190
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:51,950
We've made no progress for some time.


191
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:55,700
It's hardly a surprise.
Shindo and I aside,


192
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:59,130
neither Hakozaki nor Tokitate
has any decent gear.


193
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:02,800
This is foreseeable.


194
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:06,490
There are nine, no, ten kilometers left?


195
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:08,530
Walk another ten kilometers
in this weather?


196
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:11,420
Will I finish it
in the remaining six hours?


197
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:16,680
Darn it.


198
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:19,740
So much for that high knee run.


199
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,970
It's fine as long as one of us survives.


200
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,390
That's the rule.


201
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:31,040
But, if we die here,


202
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:34,380
due to hypothermia, we can't be revived.


203
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:39,930
Unlike the other quests,
we can't be revived infinitely.


204
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:47,230
It's too traumatizing,
physically and mentally.


205
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:54,960
To avoid freezing to death,


206
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:59,020
it's best that I dig a shelter
and wait for the blizzard to pass.


207
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,720
But there's not much time left,
if I stop now,


208
00:17:04,349 --> 00:17:05,329
we will all be eliminated.


209
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,140
What was that?


210
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:52,410
I'm actually attacked by a monster here?


211
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:55,800
Come on! This is too tough!


212
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:57,750
I have to run away from it.


213
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:00,970
It won't work.


214
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:33,520
Very well.


215
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:35,210
Bring it on!


216
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,280
That was close.


217
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,760
I couldn't have done it
if it was any stronger.


218
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:04,130
It probably only attacked me in a blizzard


219
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:07,070
because it was really starving?


220
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,740
It actually has kids?


221
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,850
Monsters are also creatures, after all.


222
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:25,340
Are you trying to make me feel guilty?


223
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:32,530
They'll eventually die of hunger
or coldness if I leave them here?


224
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,980
But, it's none of my business.


225
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:40,160
It's a virtual world anyway.


226
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:57,130
Darn it.


227
00:19:57,810 --> 00:19:58,940
Where am I?


228
00:19:59,160 --> 00:19:59,580
QUEST: EXPLORE 5% OF THE MAP
(4.993% COMPLETED)


229
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:01,240
Only five hours left.


230
00:20:07,930 --> 00:20:10,170
I've made a decision.


231
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:16,660
So, while I'm healthy,
I want to help everyone.


232
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:22,070
As human, we have priorities.


233
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:24,390
Help me.


234
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:30,650
I think it's fair
that everyone is unequal.


235
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:36,200
Those that are more valuable,
and better than me,


236
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:38,440
must not die.


237
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,980
If I can't complete this quest,


238
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:47,190
we'll all be dead in the real world.


239
00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:49,000
In such a place...


240
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:50,650
Why us?


241
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:53,610
Why are you making us do this?


242
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:58,410
How can I rest in peace
without getting an answer to that?


243
00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:02,560
Wait...


244
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:07,980
If I die in here,


245
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:12,470
we will all...


246
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:15,160
Die.


247
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:39,960
EPISODE 10, THE DEATH OF YOTSUYA YUSUKE


248
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:55,060
In the shiny world


249
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:57,980
Embracing the moment


250
00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:00,810
In the shiny world


251
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:03,780
Now, now, now


252
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,620
How can I become stronger


253
00:22:06,810 --> 00:22:09,540
The reason why I always feel lost


254
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:11,160
Now, now, now


255
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:14,690
Memories sparkle


256
00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:18,410
If I could become you or somebody else


257
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:21,250
Flying birds


258
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,830
Now, now, now


259
00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:26,350
Must share the same wishes


260
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:34,540
Even though all the "ifs" come true


261
00:22:34,610 --> 00:22:37,790
I won't be me again


262
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:44,770
Write down your dream and my name


263
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:47,630
On the beach with an hour hand


264
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:49,630
It'll disappear soon


265
00:22:49,850 --> 00:22:56,470
Even so, I want to be me for once


266
00:22:56,670 --> 00:22:59,330
Unpredictable future


267
00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:02,410
Moving forward with you


268
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:05,340
In the shiny world


269
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:05,910
Embracing the moment


270
00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:12,580
Hello everyone! I'm Liyuu.


271
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:13,620
ENDING THEME SONG PERFORMER
LIYUU


272
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:18,450
What do you think about Carpe Diem,
the ending theme song, performed by me?


273
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:22,430
It's a really nice song.
I hope you'll like it.
