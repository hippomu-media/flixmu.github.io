1
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:26,350
Feel my power!


2
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:28,940
Dark lightning!


3
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:45,250
Magician Pink,
you've exhausted the Light of Hope.


4
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:47,170
It's not true.


5
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:48,400
Take that!


6
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:00,430
Magician Purple!


7
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:02,800
Horsey! Cowy!


8
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:05,690
Do you want to keep going?


9
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,000
Give up!


10
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:08,960
It's over!


11
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:18,400
I, Boss Lucifer, shall rule the world
with desperate darkness.


12
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:24,570
Sweet dreams will be taken from children
worldwide. The darkest night has begun.


13
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:32,380
I won't give up.


14
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:45,600
You won't get what you want!


15
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:48,650
Whatever happens, I,


16
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:53,310
no, we Magical Sisters will never give up!


17
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:13,440
Because we believe in the future.


18
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,890
I can feel you, Magician Purple.


19
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,800
We believe in love.


20
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:29,340
The Light of Hope will never die.


21
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:31,310
Whenever it might be,


22
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:33,130
it's lit up in here.


23
00:02:34,079 --> 00:02:35,590
Flame of the Red Lotus!


24
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:36,950
Burn it down!


25
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:40,600
Magical Fire!


26
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:55,540
Burn it down with the fire of red lotus


27
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:57,910
Magical Fire!


28
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:05,680
MAGICAL SISTERS


29
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:12,570
Whenever people make fun of my dream,
there's a sound in my heart


30
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:17,290
That's the dream that I can't give up


31
00:03:19,329 --> 00:03:22,660
Let's go! The very first step


32
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:28,329
Even without hearing
the whistle, from now on


33
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:34,079
I shall run freely under this sky,
my dear sister


34
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:38,740
Like magic, thinking, wishing, fulfilling


35
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:47,630
Efforts are so beautiful, no pain, no gain


36
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:55,370
Love, future, all the smiles in the world,
so as to protect them all


37
00:03:55,510 --> 00:04:01,580
Pain is inevitable


38
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:08,920
Go and fight! Magical Sisters!


39
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:23,330
EPISODE 11, FOREVER MAGICAL


40
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:25,180
Forever magical.


41
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:32,640
When I was a kid,
I'd been a fan of the Magical Sisters.


42
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:36,120
Love and friendship, courage and hope.


43
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:41,330
With these, I can become a cool magician
to save the world.


44
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:44,730
Magical Fire.


45
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:50,560
I knew it, I can't do it.


46
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:53,360
I know what I'm capable of.


47
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:01,850
I've been trying to protect myself
by looking for powerful allies.


48
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:02,910
GIRLS WHO ARE ONLY CUTE
WHEN TALKING TO BOYS


49
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,630
I talk shit behind their back,


50
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:09,140
but when there's a mutual enemy,
I cling on to them again.


51
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:14,370
Everyone is like that,


52
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:17,770
so I've never questioned it.


53
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:20,990
You can't survive
without fawning upon others.


54
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:23,520
What's wrong with that?


55
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:26,840
Magicians of love and hope, what the heck?


56
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,290
I'm revived.


57
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:02,860
Right then, I thought that
all hope was lost.


58
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,500
This place is...


59
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:20,860
I'm revived because I died in a place
where my body temperature is stable?


60
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:25,600
Is this a secret labyrinth?


61
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:27,320
Interesting.


62
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:36,010
I'd never imagined something like this
in the mountains.


63
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:49,830
QUEST: EXPLORE 5% OF THE MAP
(4.993% COMPLETED)


64
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:51,909
Although I have no idea
where it might lead to,


65
00:06:52,240 --> 00:07:01,450
I should be able to clear the stage
by going forward.


66
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:04,000
Why?


67
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:06,890
Get up!


68
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:13,880
Please! Come on!
Don't die in such a place!


69
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:18,880
Darn it, I zoned out for a minute there.


70
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,480
Kusue?


71
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:22,080
HAKOZAKI KUSUE, DEAD


72
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:27,320
I must complete this ridiculous quest.


73
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:35,380
I should have checked the directions
as I move along in the first place.


74
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:40,500
The wind has died down a bit,
although it's still hard to walk.


75
00:07:40,659 --> 00:07:41,490
Even so...


76
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,820
Great! There's a village.


77
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,870
Just what I thought.


78
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:55,530
Once I get there, I should be able
to borrow a carriage or sled.


79
00:07:55,690 --> 00:07:58,510
Something that allows me to travel faster.


80
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:02,440
Hold on, Kusue.
I'll bring you back to life soon!


81
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:12,960
Yotsuya and Yuka are both alive.


82
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,180
I'm almost there...


83
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:22,910
If we all work together...


84
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,370
Are you kidding me?


85
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:48,120
No way...


86
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,000
SHINDO IU, DEAD; HAKOZAKI KUSUE, DEAD


87
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,350
Shindo, she is...


88
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:54,680
Although she stopped for a while,
she managed to explore a bit more.


89
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:56,850
I thought I could count on her.


90
00:08:57,510 --> 00:08:59,240
Why would she die now?


91
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:04,240
I can only turn around to
look for another route.


92
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,260
Darn it.


93
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:18,870
Darn it.


94
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:34,870
Darn it, dead ends everywhere.


95
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:37,390
It's too hard.


96
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:41,010
Oh no, an earthquake?


97
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:10,300
Hey, you...


98
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:15,730
Seems like their earthworms
are the same as ours,


99
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,930
they all live by eating the soil.


100
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:21,890
This dude is going somewhere
I haven't been.


101
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:23,340
It's not dangerous either.


102
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:27,000
It's very helpful right now, but...


103
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,780
It's so slow.


104
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:33,120
What is its hourly speed?


105
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:35,440
I can't go back to the ground right now.


106
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:38,270
I'm counting on this dude now.


107
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:43,330
Can you hurry up? I'm in a bit of a hurry.


108
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:48,340
Awesome, good job, Earthworm Taro!


109
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:51,120
Good chap, keep going!


110
00:10:57,350 --> 00:10:58,810
There's another one?


111
00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:01,630
Hey, don't take over Taro's tunnel!


112
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:04,000
Besides, there's soil left for you.


113
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:12,060
Is it coming after me?


114
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:17,040
"MAGICAL SERIES": A POPULAR
11 SEASON ANIME SERIES

00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,000
TARGET AUDIENCE: WOMEN AND CHILDREN,
EXCELLENT DRAWING


116
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,330
EP 49, "THE NIGHT OF THE MAGICAL SISTERS,"
WHERE THEY FOUGHT WITH BOSS LUCIFER


117
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:20,250
EP 14," GO! MAGICAL EXPRESS,"
THE FIRST APPEARANCE OF THE OUROBOROS


118
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:21,000
ASTOUNDINGLY BEAUTIFUL IMAGES ARE FEATURED


119
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:31,880
This is ridiculous.


120
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:36,510
Under such circumstances,
only Yotsuya and I are alive.


121
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:40,280
The revival countdown stopped for Iu
and Kusue.


122
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:43,710
On that note,
can we still clear the stage?


123
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:46,170
No way...


124
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:46,660
YOTSUYA YUSUKE, DEAD


125
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:47,730
What's going on?


126
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:54,400
I can't...


127
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:57,990
My body and mind are going to freeze.


128
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,300
What?


129
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,540
Why do I feel relieved?


130
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:12,440
I see. I've been waiting
for an excuse to give up.


131
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,440
Although I don't wish to die,


132
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:18,270
everyone has died sooner than me
so it's not my fault.


133
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,580
I can't do it on my own anyway.


134
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:25,290
I don't have to try so hard anymore.


135
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:32,220
I can just die like this. It's so easy.


136
00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:35,800
Hey, what are you doing here?


137
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:41,210
What are you doing here, Magician Pink?


138
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:44,510
Magician Purple?


139
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:47,120
No, this is only a dream.


140
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:49,600
It's my last wish.


141
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:54,650
Wishful thinking... a hallucination
in the name of my wishful thinking.


142
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:56,410
Magician Pink!


143
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:59,270
Me?


144
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:04,280
What have you learned from us
all these years?


145
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:08,530
In the last episode,
when the first generation Magician Pink


146
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:12,380
was defeated by the Boss Lucifer's
dark lightning. What did she do?


147
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:14,890
I know.


148
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:16,440
We...


149
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:19,030
In the last episode,
when the second generation Magician Pink


150
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:22,910
was defeated by the electric power
of the Ouroboros. What did she do?


151
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,050
I know.


152
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:25,860
I'll definitely...


153
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:31,150
When the third generation Magician Pink
was defeated by the Gorgon?


154
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:31,950
I watched all of them, so...


155
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,130
Never give up...


156
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:34,990
I know all of that!


157
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:36,570
I'll ask you again!


158
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:39,940
What have you learned from us
all these years?


159
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:40,890
Answer me!


160
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:44,760
Magical Sisters, at all times...


161
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:48,560
We will fight for love and hope
of all children in the world!


162
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:50,680
we'll stand up for others!


163
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,920
Let's burn it down with the
Flame of the Red Lotus!


164
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:07,390
Magical Fire!


165
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:32,630
Yuka...


166
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:43,340
Come here quickly.


167
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,970
I love your smile the most.


168
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:53,660
Tsubasa!


169
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:55,230
Almost there.


170
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:56,200
Keep going.


171
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,250
Go!


172
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,970
You can do it!


173
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:01,160
I'm so happy.


174
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:09,400
I won't give up.


175
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:14,410
it's because I'm a Magical Girl...


176
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,180
You'll die if you fall asleep now.


177
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:29,780
You're a player, aren't you?


178
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:31,540
Come up here.


179
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:34,680
Come on.


180
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:46,060
The fourth week?


181
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:48,330
An unexpected blizzard
in the middle of a quest.


182
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:49,540
Such a bad luck.


183
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:50,620
Yes.


184
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:53,200
So, where are you going?


185
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:54,980
Right.


186
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:57,080
QUEST: EXPLORE 5% OF THE MAP
(4.996% COMPLETED) 3 MINUTES LEFT


187
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,060
No way!


188
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,120
I'll never make it!


189
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:02,670
Are you in a hurry?


190
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,500
Why?


191
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:09,720
Okay, so it's really urgent.


192
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:11,780
Hold on tight.


193
00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:13,250
Speed up!


194
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:17,530
Air spirit Sylph, grant me your power!


195
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,820
In the name of Sorceress Fatina, Wind!


196
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:25,930
How about this?


197
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:29,630
Excuse me, are you also a player?


198
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:30,960
No, I'm not.


199
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:33,620
I'm only a sorceress.


200
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,330
Sorceress?


201
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:37,580
"Wind!"


202
00:16:43,330 --> 00:16:44,250
QUEST: EXPLORE 5% OF THE MAP
(4.996% COMPLETED) 28 SECONDS LEFT


203
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:46,700
Please... Just a bit more!


204
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:52,030
Wind, please bless the warrior!


205
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:15,750
Really? I'm still alive?


206
00:17:16,089 --> 00:17:20,079
So, what happened? Who made it?


207
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:23,470
Is it...


208
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:24,490
Yuka!


209
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:26,810
Is this...


210
00:17:27,329 --> 00:17:29,960
a chance for me to take all the credit?


211
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:32,120
They owe me a favor.


212
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:33,390
Good job.


213
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,230
What the... don't show up behind me!


214
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:39,850
So, as the reward,
you may ask your question now.


215
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:43,480
How come we only get one question
after all that hard work?


216
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:45,330
Is that your question?


217
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:47,960
No... wait!


218
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,290
Now that I think about it,


219
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:53,550
it's in the setting that
she came to save me at the end.


220
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:57,310
All of us nearly died!


221
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,690
Who was that sorceress?


222
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:03,310
No, wait. I only get one question.


223
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:09,440
This world,


224
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:15,880
it's a virtual world,
an imaginary one, isn't it?


225
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,320
"Parallel World."


226
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:25,570
A world parallel to the real world.


227
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:28,360
Parallel world?


228
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:28,750
For example, if you're at a forked road,


229
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:31,040
PARALLEL WORLD, REAL WORLD


230
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:33,420
there's you that turns right,


231
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:38,900
and another you that goes left
into another possible world.


232
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:43,680
In this hypothesis, the world
that you turned left into


233
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,680
is the parallel world.


234
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,620
Therefore, whenever we make a choice,


235
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:51,830
there are as many parallel worlds
as the possibilities in this universe.


236
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:55,450
THE NUMBER OF PARALLEL WORLDS


237
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:57,940
It's theoretically correct.


238
00:18:58,790 --> 00:19:04,890
So, what if I turn left
and die in an accident?


239
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:08,560
I will die and disappear
from this parallel world.


240
00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:14,470
So, what if the choice was made
three years ago?


241
00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:17,790
There will be a parallel world
where I don't exist


242
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:21,140
because I died three years ago
in an accident.


243
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:26,850
So, what if it was a decision
made by your parents 20 years ago?


244
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:32,270
There will be a parallel world
where your parents died 20 years ago.


245
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:35,150
And of course,
none of you would have been born.


246
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:40,200
As such, parallel worlds drift further
away from the reality


247
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:43,030
with each difference made in the past.


248
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:44,620
Such differences


249
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:48,730
have been constantly happening
since the birth of the universe.


250
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,030
In other words,


251
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:55,000
there's an indefinite number
of parallel worlds?


252
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:58,080
We have a special method to help us


253
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:03,240
observe and move between "parallel worlds
that meet specific conditions."


254
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:08,120
The specific condition is
having similar wavelength as this world.


255
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:10,030
In other words,


256
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:13,500
"when a difference occurred
4.6 billion years ago,"


257
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:16,910
"intelligent creatures
similar to humans" were born.


258
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:20,190
These creatures went through a history
similar to that of humans


259
00:20:20,530 --> 00:20:23,210
on "a plausible Earth."


260
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:24,890
What are you saying?


261
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:29,390
You don't have the right to ask questions.


262
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:36,300
Of course, the name, composition, and
topography of the planet are different.


263
00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:39,770
But it's not an imaginary world.


264
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:44,620
It's a planet that's in the same place
as Earth in the parallel world.


265
00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:48,850
Let's just say that you are the ones
that are virtual in this world.


266
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,550
We are virtual?


267
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:54,000
We wouldn't be able to revive
if it wasn't for it.


268
00:20:54,090 --> 00:20:54,810
Indeed.


269
00:20:56,450 --> 00:20:59,030
Therefore, everything else,


270
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,560
the sky, the ocean, the continents,


271
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:05,520
the residents and other humans


272
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:09,840
are real entities with flesh and blood.


273
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:17,200
People in this world,


274
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:21,020
are not virtual characters,
but humans in a parallel world.


275
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:38,390
I killed someone.


276
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:55,060
In the shiny world


277
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:57,980
Embracing the moment


278
00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:00,810
In the shiny world


279
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:03,780
Now, now, now


280
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,620
How can I become stronger


281
00:22:06,810 --> 00:22:09,540
The reason why I always feel lost


282
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:11,160
Now, now, now


283
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:14,690
Memories sparkle


284
00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:18,410
If I could become you or somebody else


285
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:21,250
Flying birds


286
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,830
Now, now, now


287
00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:26,350
Must share the same wishes


288
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:34,540
Even though all the "ifs" come true


289
00:22:34,610 --> 00:22:37,790
I won't be me again


290
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:44,770
Write down your dream and my name


291
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:47,630
On the beach with an hour hand


292
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:49,630
It'll disappear soon


293
00:22:49,850 --> 00:22:56,470
Even so, I want to be me for once


294
00:22:56,670 --> 00:22:59,330
Unpredictable future


295
00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:02,410
Moving forward with you


296
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:05,340
In the shiny world


297
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:05,910
Embracing the moment

QUEST: TRANSFORM INTO A MAGICAL GIRL


300
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:11,760
Please transform into a Magical Girl.


301
00:23:13,610 --> 00:23:17,040
King of Deock, I'm here to avenge Bimzberg!


302
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:18,420
Magical night,


303
00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:19,970
transform!


304
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,890
Burn it down with
the Flame of the Red Lotus!


305
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:29,790
Magical, Fantasy Fire!


306
00:23:32,930 --> 00:23:33,940
Was I dreaming?


307
00:23:34,190 --> 00:23:36,620
If only a Magical Girl would show up now.


308
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,070
Looking for me?


309
00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:39,500
Not you!
