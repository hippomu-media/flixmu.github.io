1
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:14,490
What?


2
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:19,240
Yotsuya, you haven't turned in
your preference form, have you?


3
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,450
Well...


4
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:25,210
Our teacher preached at you, didn't he?


5
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:26,970
What about you, Shindo?


6
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:29,700
I haven't decided on a career.


7
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:32,380
As for high school, I wrote down
Morokoshi Science Vocational High School.


8
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:34,350
So did Kusue.


9
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:35,640
I see.


10
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:38,010
Kusue has everything planned, right?


11
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:41,450
I want to study in the department
of pharmacy in university.


12
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,970
In the future,
I want to do pharmaceutical research.


13
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:48,900
This is so embarrassing.


14
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:50,540
Not at all.


15
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:52,360
You can do it, Kusue.


16
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:53,580
Can I?


17
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:55,000
Yes. Just go for it!


18
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:09,840
I'M STANDING ON A MILLION LIVES


19
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:14,660
The strange routine in front of me


20
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:18,610
Stepping out of common sense


21
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:27,800
Cutting off the comforting link
to look for the true light


22
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:32,580
My back is against the wall,
I can't give in


23
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:37,180
(Be tough, don't cry, keep going)


24
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:40,620
The reality is a matter of life or death


25
00:01:40,789 --> 00:01:45,080
The enthusiasm within my heart
(surviving in despair)


26
00:01:45,229 --> 00:01:49,410
Entering the spiritual world
(fearless, striving)


27
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:53,759
We were born with loneliness


28
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:58,250
Walk side by side,
and be vulnerable no more


29
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:02,790
Even in the face of life's uncertainty


30
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:06,920
The fire of life will never die


31
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:11,200
With courage in my hand, I stand strong


32
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:18,430
Fight for tomorrow


33
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:30,200
Okay, let's go find a goblin.


34
00:02:32,079 --> 00:02:35,100
Please eliminate it and save the village!


35
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:39,579
At my current level...


36
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:41,579
Run! You're no match of it.


37
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:48,840
At my current level,
I not only can't eliminate it


38
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:52,240
but I'll also be devoured like Shindo.


39
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:57,610
I must defeat some minor monsters
to get upgraded.


40
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:02,030
Log dot.


41
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,030
Say,


42
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:14,210
if next week, the newbie is a boy,
who would you want it to be, Kusue?


43
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:18,130
Yamada.


44
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:20,700
Oh, the one who competed in
the national Judo competition.


45
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:22,050
That's not what I meant.


46
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:24,430
I meant the boy that you like.


47
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,520
I hate boys.


48
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:27,860
Why?


49
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,380
They're all childish and violent.


50
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:34,500
And they tell dirty jokes.
I don't like that.


51
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:36,470
Such a baby.


52
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:39,250
You're also just a kid.


53
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:40,870
As for me...


54
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:41,820
I'd say Yotsuya.


55
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:44,160
No, wait.


56
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:47,560
Right, there are two Yotsuya
in the same grade.


57
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:49,940
Which one?


58
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,500
Well...


59
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:56,720
That one.


60
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:03,390
I didn't hear it!


61
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:04,870
Which one was it?


62
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:08,160
Anyway, it's one or the other.


63
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:11,780
Moreover, it's two girls
and one boy at the moment.


64
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,060
They might profess their love to me.


65
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:16,700
Great!


66
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:19,480
I have to do my best.


67
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,630
A forest with a view of the village.


68
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:29,350
How nostalgic.


69
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:46,540
Speaking of the devil.


70
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,600
HEADQUARTERS


71
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:58,760
Whenever I think of it,


72
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:04,920
my mind darkens with rage.


73
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:10,950
I'm Yotsuya Yusuke from Kumamoto.


74
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:20,550
I missed one! Darn it!


75
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:26,260
Calm down. I got too worked up.


76
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:28,410
Level nine.


77
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:29,000
YOTSUYA YUSUKE, FARMER LEVEL 9
KNOWLEDGE OF EDIBLE PLANTS


78
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,430
I'm almost level ten now.


79
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:33,980
I would have been upgraded
if I hadn't missed that one.


80
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:37,810
By the way, is there a feature
to change my occupation?


81
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:41,350
Will I have to stay like this?


82
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:42,960
No way.


83
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:47,580
There were so many occupations.
There must be something else.


84
00:05:49,659 --> 00:05:52,480
Anyway, I'd like to have a knife, a knife!


85
00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:57,150
The only person that can use the sword
is Hakozaki. That's completely pointless.


86
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,409
HAKOZAKI KUSUE, WARRIOR (SWORD) LEVEL 1


87
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,620
Doesn't she hate boys?


88
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:04,480
I wish I could be a warrior.


89
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:06,700
HAKOZAKI KUSUE
DEAD, TIME UNTIL REVIVAL


90
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:07,980
Hakozaki died?


91
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:10,060
What did she do?


92
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:12,010
Isn't she in the village?


93
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,090
I remember the quest was...


94
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:21,850
COMPLETE VILLAGE CHIEF'S TASK


95
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,190
Did we fail the quest?


96
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:29,250
What happens if we fail?


97
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:30,840
Are we going to die?


98
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:33,370
Anyway, I must rush to the village.


99
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,040
TIME UNTIL REVIVAL


100
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:41,690
She didn't revive.


101
00:06:42,159 --> 00:06:44,800
No way! Hakozaki was also devoured?


102
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:46,000
In other words,


103
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:48,720
if I die, we die for real.


104
00:06:53,159 --> 00:06:54,210
Where are the villagers?


105
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:57,280
Hello?


106
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,000
A log dot.


107
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,680
Please, give me some information.


108
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:16,180
Why are you working so hard
to swing the sword?


109
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:21,290
I'm so sickly in the real world


110
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:24,160
that I can't do exercise too hard.


111
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:27,790
So, I'm swinging something
this heavy for the first time.


112
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:29,370
The real world?


113
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:34,810
To avoid relapse, I have to
take very expensive drugs every month.


114
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:41,420
My parents had wanted to
have another child.


115
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:45,790
Here in this world,
I won't have to worry about getting ill.


116
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:48,580
I might even grow stronger.


117
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:54,210
However, I've been a burden.


118
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:59,130
I've been nothing but a burden to others
since I was born.


119
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,130
And that was the only way
I could survive.


120
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:07,310
So, while I'm healthy,
I want to help everyone.


121
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:10,450
What was I saying? Sorry.


122
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:12,790
I suddenly said such nonsense.


123
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:15,090
Anyway, I'll do my best.


124
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:19,720
If anything happens,
I'll protect everyone!


125
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:24,240
I...


126
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:30,700
Haven't I only cared about myself
since I arrived in this world?


127
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:31,960
The Troll!


128
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,370
Run! I'll buy us some time!


129
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:37,850
No, it's not just that.


130
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:40,600
It isn't since I arrived in this world.


131
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:50,750
I've been always like this.


132
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:53,220
Please leave the village!


133
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:03,820
Wait!


134
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:10,300
"Shield."


135
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:26,170
Save me...


136
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:30,780
Save me...


137
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:32,820
Yotsuya.


138
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,130
I...


139
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,540
What do I do now? Fight--


140
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,000
No, I must run.


141
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:50,370
I can't die yet!


142
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:02,040
I'm... going to die!


143
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:04,660
RULES OF REVIVAL
REVIVAL OCCURS AFTER A SPECIFIC DURATION


144
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:06,330
ALL DAMAGES WILL BE UNDONE
WITHIN HALF OF THE DURATION


145
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:08,000
IF REVIVAL IS FOLLOWED BY IMMEDIATE DEATH,
BEING IN THE SEA, REVIVAL COUNTDOWN STOPS


146
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:14,650
After we graduate from high school,
we'll come here again


147
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:16,950
to dig out the time capsule.


148
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,080
Sure!


149
00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:19,830
We must come back here.


150
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,000
Yes. We're all looking forward to it.


151
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:24,400
After graduating from high school...


152
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:29,470
In the future,
I want to do pharmaceutical research.


153
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:32,700
I wasn't interested at all.


154
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:35,760
I didn't pay any attention.


155
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:40,840
I've been nothing but a burden to others
since I was born.


156
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:44,350
That was the only way
that I could survive so...


157
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:46,700
Up until that moment...


158
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:50,880
What?


159
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:55,330
The dream of a sickly child
who's caused her parents so much trouble


160
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:56,880
is to do pharmaceutical research.


161
00:10:57,430 --> 00:11:01,000
How stereotypical! How heart-warming.


162
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:01,850
Damn it.


163
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:06,150
Are you even better than me?


164
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,010
How can I let this person


165
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:12,640
die in the Other World?


166
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:15,970
Okay, I'll do everything I can!


167
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:21,710
I'll never let anyone better than me die.


168
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:25,560
Not then...


169
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:28,320
Not ever!


170
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:40,690
It only hops like a frog at full speed?


171
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:47,470
If so, I can duck by changing
my direction when it hops.


172
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:51,120
I can shake it off if I keep going!


173
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:53,710
As long as I keep going!


174
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:03,340
If I just keep running away,


175
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,180
it's just as pointless!


176
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:12,200
I have to launch an attack somehow.


177
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:15,840
Oh no!


178
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:24,970
Upgrade!


179
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:34,690
It stopped.


180
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:41,190
Congratulations! You've reached level ten.


181
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:44,380
Awesome! I made it!


182
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:47,750
Game master, why is your voice different?


183
00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:49,140
It's time to change occupations.


184
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:51,520
Spin the occupation roulette.


185
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:52,500
That's too fast!


186
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,550
At least let me savor the moment!


187
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,400
Never mind.


188
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:58,870
Anyway, I want a knife. Warrior.


189
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,760
Give me knives!


190
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,400
A cook.


191
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,790
UPGRADE BONUS ADDED UP SEQUENTIALLY
BY THE PARAMETER (ORIGINAL SKILL -100)梅2
KNOWLEDGE OF MONSTERS' (LEVEL C AND BELOW)
ANATOMY AND CULINARY METHODS
KNOWLEDGE EDIBLE PLANTS


192
00:13:06,930 --> 00:13:10,110
In total, you have these skills.


193
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:11,370
So lame.


194
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:13,390
No, hold on.


195
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:14,970
FRUIT KNIFE, CHEF'S KNIFE


196
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:17,440
I have a knife!


197
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:24,400
What's this?


198
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:27,450
KNOWLEDGE OF MONSTERS' (LEVEL C AND BELOW)
ANATOMY AND CULINARY METHODS


199
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:29,640
It's the cook's skills?


200
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:33,090
Well, the game will now resume.


201
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:34,430
Bye.


202
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:38,290
Your stomach, it should be here!


203
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:41,730
It's too hard!


204
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:45,710
I must cut through to the stomach!


205
00:13:50,650 --> 00:13:51,560
How's that?


206
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:58,310
Yes, it works.


207
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:09,510
I did it!


208
00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:11,750
Thank goodness.


209
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:14,910
Even if we revive,
we'd die immediately in the stomach.


210
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,840
It was a dead end.


211
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,060
Yotsuya, you saved us.


212
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:21,790
Yes.


213
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:22,540
Sort of.


214
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:25,230
By the way, Yotsuya, your outfit changed?


215
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:28,150
My occupation is now a cook.


216
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:30,100
A cook?


217
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:33,700
Whatever. I now know its attack pattern.


218
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:37,370
Come here!


219
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,400
That's it!


220
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:42,700
We can dodge it by changing the direction
as soon as it hops.


221
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,500
No, that's too energy-consuming.


222
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:48,440
Even if we can dodge it,
I doubt we can do it more than twice.


223
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,330
No, not necessarily.


224
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,880
The monster is exhausted.
Is it because of the bleeding?


225
00:14:57,990 --> 00:15:01,520
That thing has been jumping around
for almost 20 meters now.


226
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:03,100
Let's do this, Kusue.


227
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:04,220
Yes.


228
00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:09,430
That's so tough, its muscle is tough.


229
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:12,680
Even if we figured that out...


230
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:16,490
Okay!


231
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:22,180
Attacking with enough force
to break down the troll's defense...


232
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:23,900
Revived!


233
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:29,560
It was impossible.


234
00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:39,440
We're not dying that often now.


235
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:42,960
It's because we got used to its movement.


236
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:47,430
Even so, if we don't defeat it,
sooner or later, we'll...


237
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:58,450
Wind magic can only manipulate the air.


238
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:01,220
At my level, this is all I can do.


239
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:05,350
Shindo.


240
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:09,760
I'll enter from its wound
and attack from inside.


241
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:11,650
Shindo, you'll...


242
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:15,110
Okay. Understood.


243
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:21,760
The main attacking range is
between the elbow and the finger tips.


244
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:25,590
Well then, with all my determination,


245
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:27,040
jump right in there!


246
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,070
Here I go!


247
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,180
I can immobilize it.


248
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,850
Shindo, you'll...


249
00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:50,470
Inside that troll's body...


250
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:53,220
"Wind"


251
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,650
Blow in air.


252
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:07,190
We did it!


253
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,990
Iu, that's impressive!


254
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:12,829
Congratulations!


255
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:14,170
You scared me!


256
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:15,609
You have cleared the stage.


257
00:17:15,849 --> 00:17:17,220
Oh, have we?


258
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:20,310
By the way,
why do you always appear from behind?


259
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:23,550
Amazing, we're upgraded.


260
00:17:23,619 --> 00:17:24,660
HAKOZAKI KUSUE, LEVEL ONE TO FOUR


261
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:25,250
SHINDO IU, LEVEL THREE TO FIVE


262
00:17:25,329 --> 00:17:28,030
The magician is barely upgraded.


263
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:30,740
The farmer and cook upgrade so fast.


264
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:33,450
YOTSUYA YUSUKE, LEVEL ONE TO FIVE


265
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,520
It's true.


266
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:37,970
Well, the cook, Yotsuya Yusuke,


267
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:39,870
as the reward of clearing the stage,
you may ask a question.


268
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:43,060
I told you, everything happens too fast.
Let me savor the moment.


269
00:17:44,050 --> 00:17:46,680
Let me think... what should I ask?


270
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:50,970
The first week, I asked "Why me?"


271
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:54,590
Someone we know picked us.


272
00:17:55,180 --> 00:18:00,240
The second week, I asked "Who are you?"


273
00:18:00,730 --> 00:18:02,140
This dude is from the future.


274
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:05,150
And so is the commissioner?


275
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:06,780
What's his purpose?


276
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:10,570
What do these folks from
the future want from us?


277
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:15,550
In ten weeks,
or after we've cleared ten stages,


278
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,660
what are we going to do?


279
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:20,470
What?


280
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:26,220
Very well, please watch a recording
of what's happening in our world.


281
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:34,700
Is this... our city?


282
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:42,630
Okay! Next is the last summoned monster!


283
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:44,910
Split up!


284
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:50,240
Go get it!


285
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,250
What was that?


286
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:57,080
What was that?


287
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:00,160
We... we're back.


288
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:03,600
We...


289
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,050
Are we going to fight against
that monster?


290
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:14,990
Whatever. I'm going to my club.


291
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:16,970
Look at the time.


292
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:21,110
The time has stopped the moment we left.


293
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:24,730
No, at such a time--


294
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:29,530
There should be a few weeks of time
before the fourth week starts.


295
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,600
I'll be alive for the grand event.


296
00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:37,960
The efforts I've made in
the past two years won't be in vain.


297
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:39,880
Thank you so much!


298
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:45,330
True, now that she's in the third year,
she'll have to retire soon.


299
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,940
I'm off.


300
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:50,080
Yotsuya, don't forget to walk Kusue home.


301
00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:01,750
My heart is still beating so fast.


302
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:05,670
We were in that world for more than a day


303
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:08,510
but here, the time hasn't changed at all.


304
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:12,580
What's more, we need to
clear seven more stages.


305
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:16,390
Otherwise, we'll die.


306
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:20,320
Well... Thank you.


307
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:24,180
We would have been dead
if it weren't for Yotsuya.


308
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:31,240
To be honest, I don't think I've ever
walked home with a girl alone before.


309
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:35,660
After all, we're in this together.


310
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:41,750
Isn't it rare to hear people say
"I'll protect you" these days?


311
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:44,050
I don't know.


312
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:46,660
I don't like that.


313
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:50,670
I'm rebellious.
I don't like the mainstream.


314
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:54,780
Gosh, I sound redundant.


315
00:20:56,210 --> 00:21:00,370
Anyway, if we get more people to survive
in that world,


316
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:02,220
it will do us all some good.


317
00:21:02,810 --> 00:21:05,650
I think it suits me well.


318
00:21:06,570 --> 00:21:07,760
I see.


319
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:11,510
What a load of nonsense.


320
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:21,860
Suddenly, I realize that


321
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:28,030
if I give up on the quests,


322
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:33,440
the city that I hate the most,
might be destroyed.


323
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:40,020
EPISODE 2, THE CITY THAT I HATE THE MOST


324
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:55,160
In the shiny world


325
00:21:55,530 --> 00:21:58,080
Embracing the moment


326
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:00,910
In the shiny world


327
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:03,880
Now, now, now


328
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:06,720
How can I become stronger


329
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:09,620
The reason why I always feel lost


330
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:11,290
Now, now, now


331
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:14,790
Memories sparkle


332
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:18,410
If I could become you or somebody else


333
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:21,330
Flying birds


334
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:22,930
Now, now, now


335
00:22:23,130 --> 00:22:26,450
Must share the same wishes


336
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:34,640
Even though all the "ifs" come true


337
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:37,890
I won't be me again


338
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:44,870
Write down your dream and my name


339
00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:47,730
On the beach with an hour hand


340
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,730
It'll disappear soon


341
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:56,570
Even so, I want to be me for once


342
00:22:56,770 --> 00:22:59,430
Unpredictable future


343
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:02,510
Moving forward with you


344
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:05,440
In the shiny world


345
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:06,040
Embracing the moment

SIDE QUEST TWO EXPLORING THE REAL YOTSUYA


348
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:15,830
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT YOTSUYA?


349
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,620
Yotsuya?


350
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,360
He's quite cute.


351
00:23:19,650 --> 00:23:22,330
I think he's a trustworthy person.


352
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,920
He's a nice guy.


353
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:24,450
People like him would be the protagonist.


354
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:28,000
PEOPLE LIKE HIM WOULD BE THE PROTAGONIST.


355
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:30,410
Yotsuya? Do you mean...?


356
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:33,700
CUTE, GOOD GUY, TRUSTWORTHY YOTSUYA.


357
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:35,010
Oh, that one.


358
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:38,150
I don't know,
I've never really talked to him.
