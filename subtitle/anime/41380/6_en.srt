1
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:06,450
We have an order from the King
to transfer the pagans to Radorpo.


2
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:08,790
QUEST: EXPLORE 5 PERCENT OF THE MAP
DELIVER THE CARGO TO RADORPO


3
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:10,470
The cargo is those people?


4
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:15,680
They will be executed
on the hills of Radorpo.


5
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:17,480
But, if we deliver them there,


6
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:20,740
these people and that child
will all be killed.


7
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:25,020
Attacks against humans detected,
rank down.


8
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:28,530
Will it be fine if our actions
result in the death of humans?


9
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,890
Is this event part of the quest,


10
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:34,540
or is it a trap that will eliminate us?


11
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:36,320
Which one


12
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:43,950
is it?


13
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:53,840
I'M STANDING ON A MILLION LIVES


14
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:58,660
The strange routine in front of me


15
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:02,610
Stepping out of common sense


16
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:11,800
Cutting off the comforting link
to look for the true light


17
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:16,580
My back is against the wall,
I can't give in


18
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:21,180
(Be tough, don't cry, keep going)


19
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:24,620
The reality is a matter of life or death


20
00:01:24,789 --> 00:01:29,080
The enthusiasm within my heart
(surviving in despair)


21
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:33,410
Entering the spiritual world
(fearless, striving)


22
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:37,759
We were born with loneliness


23
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:42,250
Walk side by side,
and be vulnerable no more


24
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:46,789
Even in the face of life's uncertainty


25
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:50,920
The fire of life will never die


26
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:55,200
With courage in my hand, I stand strong


27
00:01:55,440 --> 00:02:02,430
Fight for tomorrow


28
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:14,140
Radorpo is at the westernmost point.
It's not under Deock Empire, is it?


29
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:19,200
Are you going to execute your citizens
in a foreign territory?


30
00:02:20,579 --> 00:02:23,350
Who are you? Tell me your name!


31
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:26,510
Kahabell,
knight of the city state Cortonel.


32
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:32,780
Even a mere soldier from a large country
is not qualified to question me.


33
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:34,480
Cortonel.


34
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:38,200
It's no more than a small country
in the traffic center.


35
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:40,280
Sorry for being disrespectful.


36
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,770
I'm Kamilt,
lance corporal of the Deock Empire.


37
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:46,540
I'm the commanding officer of this army.


38
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:51,579
You're a war hawk who only thinks of war,
and your superior was killed by a Cobalt.


39
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:53,540
What's wrong
with your magnificent country?


40
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,550
Wait a minute!


41
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:06,420
The Deock Empire is a dictatorship
trying to take over the entire continent!


42
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:09,760
It's better to kill these three here!


43
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:12,750
I won't have you insulting
the Deock Empire and the King.


44
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:15,150
I shall execute whoever comes in my way
on site!


45
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:18,310
Hey, I mean...


46
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:19,579
Yotsuya!


47
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,640
Well...


48
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:23,590
Warriors, gather around!


49
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:28,960
Right now, if delivering cargo
to Radorpo is mandatory,


50
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:32,230
that is, it's definitely happening.


51
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:34,420
Then, the "cargo," as stated in the quest,


52
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:37,440
refers to those people.


53
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:39,290
I see.


54
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:41,910
So, if we help those soldiers,


55
00:03:42,079 --> 00:03:43,660
we can complete the quest.


56
00:03:43,829 --> 00:03:45,700
However, if we deliver the prisoners,


57
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:47,910
this kid and the others
will be executed.


58
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:50,200
That's true.


59
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:55,210
Their survival might mean a lot
to people in the future.


60
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:58,450
If the result of our action is deemed
as an attack on humans,


61
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:00,000
It might be "game over" straight away.


62
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:02,410
Are you saying
that this is a phishing quest?


63
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:04,450
I'm just saying it might be possible.


64
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:09,660
Anyway, I think it's too dangerous
to get rid of the soldiers right now.


65
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:10,880
What do you think?


66
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:15,740
I have an idea.


67
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:18,250
Let's say, we'll go with them to Radorpo


68
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:21,200
but we'll stop the execution
and let them go free?


69
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:22,810
It might work.


70
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,650
Well then,


71
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:28,360
we'll travel to the destination together
before we come to a conclusion.


72
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,240
So it's decided.


73
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,600
I also think this is the best idea.


74
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:40,560
Are you sure it's fine
to travel with these people?


75
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:42,790
And even a knight from another country!


76
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:44,830
There's no other choice.


77
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:48,400
We can't kill the prisoners
before execution.


78
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:52,400
We also have to rely
on the warrior with healing powers.


79
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:55,360
He's still unconscious?


80
00:04:55,640 --> 00:05:00,100
I think he's getting better,
but he's just a kid after all.


81
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:04,060
The MP is also limited,
it takes time to recover.


82
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:07,580
Anyway, information is crucial.
I'll need information.


83
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,790
Let's camp around here, all right?


84
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:21,910
Why are we taking orders from that man?


85
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:25,980
After all, we're the ones
that's following them.


86
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:31,490
How should I put it...


87
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,360
Something's not right.


88
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:36,180
Well,


89
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:37,750
Mr. Kamilt.


90
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,409
Don't take too long.


91
00:05:43,659 --> 00:05:44,560
Excuse me.


92
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:47,140
Thank you for seeing me.


93
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:49,990
I think you'll be worried about the child.


94
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:52,420
Thank you for being so thoughtful.


95
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,120
My name is Fofcel, I'm a missionary


96
00:05:55,409 --> 00:05:57,560
from the Ija Continent.


97
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:05,200
I wish we can at least help the kid,
Beriri, to escape.


98
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:08,710
I knew it. This is the key to the quest.


99
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:13,000
In Deock Empire, whenever a follower
of the Altros religion is found,


100
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:14,470
even foreigners will be assassinated.


101
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:18,650
Radorpo can't protect him either.


102
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:23,770
On that note, why is the Altros religion
a nuisance to Deock Empire?


103
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:29,280
It's a conflict between those
who worship only the king


104
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,840
and those who worship
both the king and holy spirits.


105
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:37,430
Both sides are violent
and neither will back down.


106
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:42,190
There are constant riots and they
keep destroying each other's monuments.


107
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:47,120
The statues of Deock Empire's kings
were destroyed and that set it all off.


108
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,380
In the end, the ban on religion
was announced.


109
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:54,180
And they started to execute
all religious worshipers.


110
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,550
Are you serious?


111
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:58,810
Even for a tyranny, it's too mean
to execute people over statues.


112
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,380
Life is too harsh.


113
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:05,880
Giussissu is a god
who celebrates love and peace.


114
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:10,000
Followers who didn't understand
love and peace in the holy script,


115
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:13,740
divided all citizens into "partners"
and "others".


116
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:18,270
Some extremists took actions
that worsened the conflicts.


117
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:21,270
This is indeed a mandatory event.


118
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:26,050
Religion and dictatorship,
I can't relate to that at all.


119
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,520
Next...


120
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,180
It's time to talk to him.


121
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:32,860
Mr. Kamilt.


122
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:36,980
Why are you willing to take
such a dangerous trip


123
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:40,830
to escort the Altros followers
to Radorpo for execution?


124
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:43,260
This is to serve as a warning to others.


125
00:07:43,409 --> 00:07:45,740
They come from Ija Continent.


126
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:49,710
We must stop them at
the entry point, Radorpo.


127
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:52,460
It's to prevent more from coming.


128
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:56,980
Lower the morale of missionaries
at the entrance is an important task.


129
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:59,670
Is it necessary to go this far?


130
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,510
Well, the King...


131
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:07,860
Father!


132
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:14,130
Father...


133
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:19,940
Orphans of wars and families
with fathers who cannot work


134
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:21,950
share the same destined future.


135
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:26,340
But, King Deock V changed all that.


136
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:30,330
Those who fought bravely in the war
will surely be rewarded.


137
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:33,200
And families whose father or son died
in the war


138
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:35,350
will be allocated with a slave.


139
00:08:35,970 --> 00:08:38,620
The first step as a united country,


140
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:41,030
is to improve the lives of the citizens.


141
00:08:41,419 --> 00:08:43,669
To realize that goal,


142
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:47,510
I will keep acquiring more colonies.


143
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:51,060
That was how my family got to survive.


144
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:54,000
He's a good king
who takes care of the weak.


145
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:58,180
He's sincerely creating a united country
for the people.


146
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,580
Therefore, whatever it takes,


147
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:04,360
I must eliminate the evil Altros religion
from this continent.


148
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,270
Can you understand?


149
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:09,900
Yes.


150
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:15,080
Although executing pagans is too much,


151
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,580
they have their own reasons.


152
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:23,000
Colonizing smaller countries
to obtain slaves is to care for the weak?


153
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:26,360
This only helps the weak
within their own country.


154
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:28,630
That's rogue logic.


155
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,020
A good king?


156
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:36,380
No, now that I have thought about it,


157
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:38,430
I don't like dictatorships.


158
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:41,040
Hold on, I'm still talking.


159
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:42,220
But I'm right.


160
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:43,660
It's like bullying.


161
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:46,040
Isn't it just a matter of superiority?


162
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:48,120
Whoever spoils the mood
ends up getting resented


163
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:51,680
and they get bullied immediately.
I see that all the time.


164
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:56,800
But those who don't care would tell
the teachers or their boyfriends.


165
00:09:57,110 --> 00:10:01,040
It isn't right. That's not how it is done.


166
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:05,120
Isn't taking over small countries
just a means of bullying?


167
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:10,360
Bullying isn't about just one person!


168
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:11,990
Do you know what I'm saying?


169
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:15,180
Bullying isn't just about one person?
What does that mean?


170
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:18,160
You're made a slave because you're
an orphan or disabled? Abolish it then!


171
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:21,890
Allocate slaves?
They are not the king's slaves!


172
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,610
Anyway, I can tell you're furious.


173
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:28,000
What nonsense is that?


174
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:30,380
But I know you're insulting the King.


175
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:32,160
I'll kill you if you refuse
to take back your words!


176
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,540
Iu!


177
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:37,040
I'm sure we won't die
just by killing this one man.


178
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:37,870
Let's do it!


179
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:42,480
It's nothing, I'm sorry.
I'll tell her off.


180
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:45,210
What do you think?


181
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:48,470
I think we're all different.


182
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:53,190
According to that logic,
the King isn't wrong either.


183
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:00,000
"HORSE": HORSE FAMILY, BIPED HORSE
DIFFERENT FROM EARTH HORSES


184
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,330
OMNIVOROUS ANIMALS THAT WALK ON TWO LEGS
REGULAR ONES COST 700,000 YEN


185
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:02,580
SPECIAL INDIVIDUALS MAY COST
OVER 10 MILLION YEN


186
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:03,950
MAXIMUM SPEED WITHOUT CARGO: 70-120 KM/HR


187
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:19,860
As women, physically,
we're not as strong as men.


188
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:22,450
So, how do we bridge the gap?


189
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:25,500
By techniques? Sword fighting techniques?


190
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:31,120
To win, we must aim for the vital organs
for a fatal death.


191
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,560
Do you know any?


192
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,420
Well...


193
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:41,360
It will take seven days
to get through this mountain.


194
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,700
After that, in five days,
we'll arrive in Radorpo.


195
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:46,640
This the first time he spoke
since two nights ago.


196
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:52,920
We're still 12 days away
from the destination.


197
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:56,660
Time remaining for the quest
is 13 days and 20 hours.


198
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:58,200
We're on a tight schedule.


199
00:11:58,410 --> 00:12:00,680
Will the carriage make it past
that mountain?


200
00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:04,200
Although it's quite steep,
it's not impossible.


201
00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:07,300
However, there's another route.


202
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,160
It'll be faster.


203
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:15,680
This is exhausting.


204
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:20,340
This is the second time that
I've pushed the carriage with you.


205
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,550
True.


206
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:25,250
We're almost there. Keep going.


207
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:26,160
Yes.


208
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:29,500
We've arrived. That's the place.


209
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:37,690
What's that?


210
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,750
That's the other route?


211
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:52,450
This is a cave full of secret mechanisms
created by an ancient culture.


212
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:56,370
But the mechanism at the entrance
is still working.


213
00:12:56,570 --> 00:13:00,290
It is better than climbing up a mountain
with that carriage.


214
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:03,310
Please wait in the front.


215
00:13:03,830 --> 00:13:06,330
We'll go operate the mechanism
to open the entrance.


216
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:07,460
Okay.


217
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:15,170
That's impressive!


218
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:39,530
It's turning!


219
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,400
So cool!


220
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:44,870
Hold on.


221
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:45,760
Are you kidding me?


222
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:50,370
Open up!


223
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:51,680
Hey! Open up!


224
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:53,720
We're locked in here.


225
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:56,860
I'm sorry!


226
00:13:57,010 --> 00:14:02,120
But, we can't have evil pagans
traveling with us.


227
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,040
You...


228
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:06,490
Anyway, warriors, good luck.


229
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:10,370
No, unless you can handle
that thing on your own.


230
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:11,910
Hey! Let's get going.


231
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:13,120
Warriors!


232
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:13,920
Shut up!


233
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:17,410
Hey!


234
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:18,290
That bastard!


235
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:24,430
They also took the prisoners
who might be the cargo.


236
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,680
We're running out of time.


237
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,970
I don't know if we can get out of here.


238
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:35,900
Are you serious?
This is worse than starting over again!


239
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:43,820
I have decided.


240
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:47,060
If we go through here,
it's a shortcut anyway, right?


241
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:51,330
Let's go there first and kill those three.


242
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:55,230
Am I right? Let's go!


243
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:58,300
Let's go.


244
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,530
These mechanisms are so simple and rough.


245
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:36,880
This pillar.


246
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:38,960
It should be this one.


247
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:55,120
It worked!


248
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,040
That's scary!


249
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,080
The mechanisms are a piece of cake.


250
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,660
We'll get through it
and surprise those Deock dudes!


251
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,990
Darn it, I was too careless.


252
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:48,960
Yotsuya, what's going on down there?


253
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:52,020
Sorry, I can't go up.


254
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:55,110
Go ahead without me.


255
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:56,670
Are you serious?


256
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:59,710
It seems to be about eight floors high.


257
00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:04,040
I don't think Yotsuya can
make it back within four weeks.


258
00:17:14,109 --> 00:17:16,069
Two of the walls are moving irregularly.


259
00:17:16,339 --> 00:17:20,880
In comparison, the one behind
seems to have a shorter interval.


260
00:17:21,349 --> 00:17:25,130
We need about 40 seconds
to let the carriage pass.


261
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:29,310
We should have let Yotsuya
plan the strategy.


262
00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:32,960
We'll get to the destination
by following the plan.


263
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:34,920
Can we do it on our own?


264
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,640
Seriously, can we get out of here?


265
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:42,570
Fifteen...


266
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:43,900
What?


267
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:44,780
Well,


268
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:46,560
wait a minute.


269
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:49,190
You have pen and paper?


270
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:55,870
They have left me enough food
to last me half a day.


271
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:59,070
I must find an exit
before the fire is out.


272
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:02,450
This place is packed with remains.


273
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:07,420
I'll calculate the time
between each pause.


274
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:11,150
It should have some kind of pattern.


275
00:18:12,170 --> 00:18:12,910
What can it be?


276
00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:19,910
Is it also a hydro-powered mechanism?
Like a deer-scarer fountain.


277
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:24,820
Judging by the overall time, it's like
pushing several fountains at once.


278
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:30,410
These two are 60 and 75 seconds.


279
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:33,040
That means it's the same timing.


280
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:34,260
So the ones inside are...


281
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:36,260
I got it!


282
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:38,320
Yes, it'll work.


283
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:39,620
In this case,


284
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:42,530
it'll start moving again in 540 seconds.


285
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:45,230
Just in case, I'll go solo.


286
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:46,760
Iu!


287
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:48,950
If I don't make it,
we'll have to count on you.


288
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:02,350
She made it!


289
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:04,000
It worked!


290
00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:06,160
Yotsuya, are you down there?


291
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:08,170
Yes, I am here.


292
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:10,220
We're heading out.


293
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:12,460
Understood. I got it!


294
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:13,600
Okay.


295
00:19:14,050 --> 00:19:16,320
Why does he sound so polite?


296
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:23,120
Another dead end.


297
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:26,090
What's Yotsuya doing?


298
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:29,090
If he hadn't been there,
we would have had lost already.


299
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:32,240
Indeed. We must think of something.


300
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:38,530
Come up with something...
I have to find a way.


301
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:47,550
I can cut through it.


302
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:49,780
I'll use this as a foothold.


303
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,880
What's this? An arena?


304
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:30,080
What's in there?


305
00:20:53,290 --> 00:20:54,370
Monster!


306
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:55,350
What's that?


307
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:58,180
Gargoyle? That's the first time I see one.


308
00:20:58,290 --> 00:20:59,360
Gargoyle?


309
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:01,300
It's a man-made creature.


310
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:03,880
Is it dead?


311
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,600
They said that if you drain its body fluid
to mummify it,


312
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:09,830
it can stay alive
even after thousands of years.


313
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:15,470
No, unless you can handle
that thing on your own.


314
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:18,010
Is this what he meant?


315
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:21,750
It's... moving!

Now, now, now


321
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,620
How can I become stronger


322
00:22:06,810 --> 00:22:09,540
The reason why I always feel lost


323
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:11,160
Now, now, now


324
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:14,690
Memories sparkle


325
00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:18,410

00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:26,350
Must share the same wishes


329
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:34,540
Even though all the "ifs" come true


330
00:22:34,610 --> 00:22:37,790
I won't be me again


331
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:44,770
Write down your dream and my name


332

On the beach with an hour hand


333
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:49,630
It'll disappear soon


334
00:22:49,850 --> 00:22:56,470
Even so, I want to be me for once


335
00:22:56,670 --> 00:22:59,330
Unpredictable future


336
00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:02,410
