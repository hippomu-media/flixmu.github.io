1
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:21,000
I prefer to be alone.

2
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:27,670
I hate that city.

3
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:36,310
I hate everyone living in that city.

4
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:53,370
Even when my life's in danger,

5
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:57,600
this place is a million times more
exciting than that shithole Tokyo.

6
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:38,510
Tap Card

7
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,630
Tap Card

8
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:53,940
PE for first period is gonna kill me.

9
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:55,410
Yeah, for real.

10
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:57,400
So I was watching mikkou LIVE yesterday...

11
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,250
Oh, I totally fell asleep.

12
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:00,870
Really? That fast?

13
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,960
Nomura Yuuta.

14
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:03,720
Here.

15
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,350
Hakozaki Kusue...

16
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:09,070
is sick, so she's out for the day.

17
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:12,090
Hakozaki sure is absent a lot.

18
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:11,670
Yumiya Youhei.

19
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:12,240
Here.

20
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,290
She's got some condition that
makes her weak, apparently.

21
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:14,290
Yuura Yuki.

22
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:15,060
Here.

23
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:16,100
She always sits out in PE, too.

24
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:16,740
Morita Takeshi.

25
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:18,620
Hey, did you hear about
Nakata-kun in Class 1?

26
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:17,500
Here.

27
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,250
Morinaga Maiko.

28
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:20,370
He asked Shinnomiya-san out.

29
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:20,130
Here.

30
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:21,240
For real?!

31
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,140
That's crazy.

32
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:23,440
That bastard!

33
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:27,270
If you haven't turned in your future
plans form, you have until tomorrow.

34
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:29,030
Wanna go do some karaoke?

35
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:34,120
Here, see?

36
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,760
Whoa, it's Shindou-san.

37
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:39,860
So it's true that she was scouted as
an amateur model for Petit Lemon.

38
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:39,250
You got this, Shindou-san!

39
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,360
She's cute, she gets good grades...

40
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:45,810
She's, like, perfect.

41
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:58,410
Whoops...

42
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,580
Oh, everything's fine!

43
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:06,070
You know, streaming
outdoors is always weird.

44
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:04,640
You okay?

45
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:07,540
You have to be aware of the public eye.

46
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:09,010
Takes guts. Total respect

47
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,900
Yes! Go, go, go!

48
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:17,690
Gotcha!

49
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:21,140
Whew, that was a close one!

50
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,630
On Duty
Yotsuya Yuusuke

51
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,940
Shindou-san!

52
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:48,660
Yep, later.

53
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,220
This is it?

54
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,310
Shindou-san's amazing.

55
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:02,390
Well, she's definitely hot.

56
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:07,200
We live in such different worlds,
I can't even form an opinion.

57
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:09,170
Today's the day, huh?

58
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:09,730
Yeah.

59
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:12,590
I'm kinda nervous.

60
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:14,110
Me, too.

61
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:16,030
Doesn't she always skip PE?

62
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:19,230
Did those two ever hang out before?

63
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:24,100
Wh-What was that about?

64
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:31,690
You're the only one who hasn't turned
in your future plans form, Yotsuya.

65
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,060
You're a fast runner.

66
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:38,070
If you'd joined the track team, you could've
gotten into an athletic high school.

67
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:39,140
Yeah...

68
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:48,070
Those two again?

69
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:50,930
It's pretty rare to see them together.

70
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:53,540
Isn't there anything you really want to do?

71
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:56,910
I want to get home and play more of my game.

72
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,190
I've been thinking about it,
but there's really nothing.

73
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:02,680
I don't care about this stupid school.

74
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:06,080
You never say what you
really want to say, do you?

75
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:10,510
Yuusuke

76
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:10,500
You won't make it through high school if
you don't have friends you can open up to.

77
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:13,430
Wow, he knows. I'm impressed.

78
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:16,200
Yeah, I guess not...

79
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:19,940
I'll find a regular academic high
school to list as my first choice.

80
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:22,010
Just make sure you get it in by tomorrow.

81
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:22,870
Yes, sir.

82
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:26,950
Gotta get home to my game.

83
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:30,430
Oh, I'll lock up. I'm on duty today, soâ€”

84
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:32,920
Huh?

85
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:35,070
When did they leave?

86
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,340
Huh?!

87
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:21,050
Wh-What the heck just happened?

88
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:32,390
What the hell?!

89
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:35,080
Shit! What's going on?!

90
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,100
Yotsuya-kun!

91
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,960
Sweet! We've finally got a guy!

92
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,310
Shindou-san?!

93
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:44,170
And... uh...

94
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:47,290
I'm Hakozaki.

95
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:51,250
What the hell is this?

96
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:53,330
What the hell is this?
What the hell is this?

97
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:56,200
Okay, so a weirdo with only half
a face is about to show up.

98
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,760
Don't panic. Just listen to him.

99
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:58,640
Huh?

100
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:02,070
Nice to meet. Greetings to.

101
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:07,970
Call me Game Master, if you plea.

102
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:09,970
Glad to make your acquain.

103
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:13,460
Your head... Your head! Your head is...

104
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:16,760
I will now explain the rules to.

105
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:17,490
Huh?!

106
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:22,100
These are the instructions
for the new member of the.

107
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:25,380
You'll all be doing this togeth.

108
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:26,820
Wait, what?! Hang on a minute!

109
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:27,810
Listen, Yotsuya-kun.

110
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:30,030
Your quest is.

Just wait a sec!

118
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:46,730
I told you...

119
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:47,370
But I meanâ€”

120
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:48,240
Just listen!

121
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,330
Ow...

122
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:52,500
Huh? That didn't hurt...

123
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:55,960
Eight steps left until the quest is comp.

I see those on TV all the time!

147
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:38,810
Please be a warrior! Please be a warrior!

148
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:41,110

Huh? Wha?

154
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:49,530
Well, until we meet ag.

155
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:53,650

So, um...

00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:56,140
A farmer...

161
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:58,570
There should be limits on
what's considered super rare.

162
00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:01,980
Will someone please tell me what's going on?!

163
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:07,000
[Hoe]

164
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:07,000

00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:12,300
Were you two brought here
without warning, too?

170
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:14,010
It was just me first.

171
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:18,130
I managed to complete the first
quest and return to our world,

172
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:21,310
and then the Game Master
instructed me to do another quest.

173
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:24,230
You still get quests,
even after returning home?

174
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:27,690
Um, then Shindou-san came to me and...

175
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:29,010
Hakozaki-san!

176
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:35,940
Would you be my friend?

177
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:39,040
What?

178
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:41,950
Your friend?

179
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:45,530
The Game Master instructed me
to become friends with Kusue.

180
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,600
Then, the next time I came to this world,

181
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,670
Kusue was here.

182
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,400
We made it back again,

183
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:05,520
and this time, he instructed Kusue
and I to end up alone with you,

184
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:08,050
so I guessed you'd be next.

185
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:11,190
So that's how it happened.

186
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:16,970
I figured you'd be around to lock up on
a day you were on duty, so it'd be easy,

187
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:19,150
but you just kept getting lectured.

188
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:21,560
Wh-What could I do about that?

189
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,700
I was starting to freak out.

190
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:27,670
Me, too. I was so relieved
when the teacher finally left.

191
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:31,820
Well, it's clear now that this isn't a dream.

192
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:33,850
What weapons do you have?

193
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:34,700
Weapons?

194
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,250
Try squinting.

195
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:40,760
Hoe

196
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:40,760
Farming Tool: Overall Rank 2

Regeneration Time: 5 days

197
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:39,170
Oh!

198
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:40,760
Now touch it.

199
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,850
You can control it like a smartphone.

200
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:45,190
Oh... Oh! Oh!

201
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:50,070
The only things you can keep as
weapons are the things you see there.

202
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:49,810
Hoe

203
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:49,810
Farming Tool: Overall Rank 2
Composition:  Iron, wood
Effects:             -50% strength when attacking
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hanything but plants

204
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,850
Sickle

205
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,850
Farming Tool: Overall Rank 1
Composition:  Iron, wood
Effects:             -50% strength when attacking
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hanything but plants

206
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:52,840
It came out!

207
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:54,700
It's tiny!

208
00:11:56,070 --> 00:11:57,780
A hoe and a sickle...

209
00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:59,740
Oh. Because I'm a farmer, I guess.

210
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:03,640
So is this a virtual space?

211
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,640
Like a video game world?

212
00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:07,970
What's that?

213
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:09,120
Oh, it's a log point.

214
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:10,400
Log?

215
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:14,030
Yeah. They sometimes store scenes from
events that have already happened.

216
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:15,370
You can view them by touching it.

217
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:24,640
Hakozaki Kusue

218
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:24,640
This is impossible.
I can't fight or anything...

219
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:24,640
This is impossible.
I can't fight or anything...

220
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:28,380
It'll be fine.
I managed the first quest on my own.

221
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:28,640
It'll be fine. I managed the first quest on my own.

222
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:31,180
Shindou Iu

223
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,570
Okay? So let's just try this, Kusue.

224
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:31,180
Okay? So let's just try this, Kusue.

225
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:33,840
This is from right after
I came to this world!

226
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:36,270
D-Don't watch it!

227
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:38,380
That's what I told Kusue,

228
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:42,640
but I was so panicked, at first,
I couldn't do anything for a whole day.

229
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:45,640
Then, when I finally realized
that this was reality,

230
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,210
I guess I just made up my mind.

231
00:12:47,210 --> 00:12:52,860
Um... I really feel a lot better
having you here, Yotsuya-kun.

232
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:55,320
So basically, if we complete quests here,

233
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,280
we can go back to the
city we came from, right?

234
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:02,280
Back to that city?

235
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:03,520
Incoming!

236
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,180
Huh?

237
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:05,720
They're goblins.

238
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:06,790
Goblin?

239
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,910
They definitely look the part.

240
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:14,390
I might not be okay with any
of this, but fine! Bring it on!

241
00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:18,680
My adventure begins now!

242
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:20,800
Ah! It broke!

243
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,230
He's useless!

244
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:25,180
W-Well, you're a wizard and
a warrior, aren't you?!

245
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:26,660
Why are you just watching?!

246
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:29,900
Wind!

247
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,510
Uh, and?

248
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:37,460
All wind magic does is move the air.

249
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:39,760
And my level's low, so that's all I can do.

250
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:40,660
The hell?!

251
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:43,080
But maybe a sword...

252
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,750
I-I'm scared...

253
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:45,510
Oh, come on.

254
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:49,860
That's not how you use that!

255
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:51,710
It's mine!

256
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:53,600
Huh?

257
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,860
That won't work.

258
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:58,150
Weapons can only be picked up
by the user they're assigned to.

259
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:00,530
This feels more and more like a game.

260
00:14:00,530 --> 00:14:01,900
But...

261
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:04,360
I still have my hoe!

262
00:14:04,890 --> 00:14:06,280
It broke!

263
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:12,780
Wait, seriously?

264
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:16,420
Am I... gonna... die?

265
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:25,630
Is that me?

266
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:29,790
Hakozaki-san?!

267
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:34,780
What do Iâ€”

268
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:41,740
I came back to life?

269
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:44,650
Don't worry. You always
come back after 30 seconds.

270
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:47,320
And you couldn't have told me this before?!

271
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:50,650
Well, if dying doesn't matter,
there'll always be a way to win.

272
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,290
Shindou-san!

273
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:54,360
Help me out!

274
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:56,880
Wind!

275
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:00,630
Yotsuya-kun!

276
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:01,430
On it!

277
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:10,710
I just need to keep chipping
away at them as they fight me!

278
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:14,680
Dead

279
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:14,680
Reviving in

280
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,890
Revived

281
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:16,160
Well done.

282
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:21,620
Yotsuya-kun's plan worked out.

283
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:23,080
Yeah. Guess I misjudged him.

284
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,510
Pretty sad way to do the job, though.

285
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:27,580
Are you praising me or insulting me?
Pick one and stick with it.

286
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:31,480
Anyway, I'm impressed you handled
that on your own before.

287
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:33,920
Yeah, well...

288
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:39,750
>

289
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:40,850
The first time...

290
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,770
and the second time...

291
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:44,590
>

292
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:45,350
were both things we could handle
if we stuck to it long enough,

293
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:48,180
Ten more seconds...
C'mon, Kusue, wake up!

294
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:47,200
as long as one of us was alive.

295
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:51,590
So what happens if all of us die?

296
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:54,110
What? I didn't tell you?

297
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:57,350
If we all die, we die for real.

298
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:01,760
We die... for real?

299
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:11,370
So the areas we've been through
once show up on the map.

300
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:12,250
Yeah.

301
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:15,690
Should we go to the village
in the west tomorrow?

302
00:16:15,690 --> 00:16:16,850
It's close.

303
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:19,280
I hope the request isn't too difficult.

304
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:22,410

305
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:22,410
Broken Sickle

306
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:22,410
Farming Tool: Overall Rank 2

307
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:22,410
Broken Hoe

308
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:22,430
It's gonna take five days
for them to regenerate?

309
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:27,720
Oh, what's the reward we
get for completing quests?

310
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,850
He told me to ask you two.

311
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:33,660
Well, you get the right to ask
the Game Master one question.

312
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:34,860
That's garbage!

313
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:38,750
When I finished the first one,
I asked him why I was chosen, and...

314
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:44,000
Someone you know requested.

315
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:49,450
After the second one, I asked,
"Who are you people?"

316
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:52,430
We come from a future most dist.

317
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:59,100
The future...
and someone you know... really?

318
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:02,550
Well, anyway...

319
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,940
I'll keep watch first.

320
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:07,030
Okay.

321
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:10,770
What question would I ask him?

322
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:22,340
So if we all die, we die for real?

323
00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:26,600
Does that mean we'd be dead
in the real world, too?

324
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:31,240
I don't really get it, but we
definitely need to avoid that.

325
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:32,730
Yotsuya-kun!

326
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:35,730
Yotsuya-kun! Yotsuya-kun!

327
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:36,650
Shindou-san?!

328
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:44,500
Yo... Yotsuya-kun...

329
00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:47,400
Hakozaki-san?! What happened?!

330
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:05,820
Yotsuya-kun!

331
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:07,940
Run! We can't win this one!

332
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:13,760
It ate her...

333
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:22,140
If I die, it's all over!

334
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:27,200
Thirty seconds until Hakozaki-san revives!

335
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:28,700
Shindou-san!

336
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:30,030
Can she hear me?!

337
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:31,630
We'll head for the village first!

338
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:36,470
A wooden stick is useless against that!
What's she thinking?!

339
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:38,130
This is something we can't fight!

340
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:46,400
Huh?

341
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,820
Your left hand isn't regenerating?

342
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:52,320
Um... I think it's because it was eaten.

343
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:56,000
Then, Shindou-san...
probably won't revive, will she?

344
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:56,810
Huh?!

345
00:18:56,810 --> 00:19:00,730
Seriously? If they both die, it's over!

346
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:03,410
Can gain knowledge
about edible plants.

350
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:03,230
I have zero attack power,

351
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:05,850
and Hakozaki-san just has no power at all.

352
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:06,410
Hakozaki Kusue

355
00:19:06,290 --> 00:19:09,100
It's no use. We'll have
to ignore that giant thing

356
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:11,990
and complete the quest without Shindou-san.

357
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:17,920
It's the heroes! The heroes are here!

358
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:20,340
What "heroes"?

359
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:24,090
Apparently, that's what
we're called in this world.

360
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,550
It really is a game.

361
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:28,290
Yay! Heroes!

362
00:19:28,290 --> 00:19:29,400
Heroes!

363
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,040
My name's Thecus!

364
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,490
Oh, uh, hi there.

365
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:34,730
Man, heroes are so cool!

366
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:36,850
I'm just a farmer, though...

367
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:40,570
I wanna be strong like a hero, too!

368
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,740
One of us just got eaten, though...

369
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:46,030
I am the village chief.

370
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:47,360
Hello.

371
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:50,210
Um, so... What was your request?

372
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:55,140
Well, a monster called a troll has
shown up just outside the village.

373
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:58,050
Wait a minute! He's not talking
about that thing, is he?!

374
00:19:58,050 --> 00:19:59,460
It looks like this.

375
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:02,960
Please defeat this troll
and save our village!

376
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,450
We're dead.

377
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:10,650
U-Um... you've never even
defeated a goblin, right?

378
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:12,780
Uh... that's right.

379
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:14,860
My sword just doesn't seem to hit them.

380
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:17,850
No kidding. You were just throwing it.

381
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:22,720
I don't think Iu-chan can revive,
since she's inside the troll.

382
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,360
We have to find a way to save her...

383
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:29,670
She's useless.

384
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:32,720
Why couldn't Shindou-san have
been the one I got stuck with?

385
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:35,620
Um, Yotsuya-kun?

386
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:38,540
You stay here in the village.

387
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:40,460
Huh?

388
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:42,800
I'm going to go raise my rank.

389
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:43,440
Later.

390
00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:45,960
Wait!

391
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:51,890
But... I want to save Iu-chan, too...

392
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:53,430
Sorry, but...

393
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,840
If you die on me now...

394
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,090
I'm the one who'll be put through hell.

395
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:07,870
Okay! Go, go, go!

396
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:09,280
You're not getting away!

397
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,210
Die! Die!

398
00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:13,250
Die, die, die!

399
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:19,430
Die, die, die, die, die, die, die,
die, die, die, die, die, die, die!

400
00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:24,630
Yes!

401
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:30,190
Even when my life's in danger,

402
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:34,450
this place is a million times more
exciting than that shithole Tokyo.

403
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:40,020
Unqualified Heroes

404
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:12,160
Subquest
Roulette

405
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,140
Today's subquest is...

406
00:23:13,930 --> 00:23:15,070
Bam!

407
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,080
Attempt voice recording!

408
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:16,660
I am the village chief.

409
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:21,630
Shindou
Attempting voice recording!

410
00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:16,620
Chief

411
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:18,050
Hey, that's pretty good, Shindou-san!

412
00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:24,920
Chief

413
00:23:18,050 --> 00:23:22,330
Well, a monster called a troll has
shown up just outside the village.

414
00:23:22,330 --> 00:23:25,520
Please defeat this troll
and save our village!

415
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:28,590
Yotsuya Yuusuke will be next to attempt.

416
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:30,510
Is it gonna be the chief again?

417
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:31,690
Too easy.

418
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:32,930
Yotsuya
Attempting voice recording!

419
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:32,590
Shindou Iu

420
00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:33,080
Hakozaki-san!

421
00:23:33,010 --> 00:23:35,260
Shindou Iu

422
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:35,570
Would you be my friend?

423
00:23:36,090 --> 00:23:37,930
That was creepy, so you fail the chall.

424
00:23:37,930 --> 00:23:39,850
Well, what do you want me to do?!
