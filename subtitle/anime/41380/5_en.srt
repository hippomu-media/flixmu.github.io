1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:01,600
Hoshi, shoot!


2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:03,380
Rebound!


3
00:00:04,090 --> 00:00:04,720
Out!


4
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:07,680
Why?


5
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:09,620
I hate PE classes.


6
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:16,140
It's the doctor's orders and besides,
my grades are always still the worst.


7
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:21,920
Due to my condition, I always
have the worst  grades in my class.


8
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:27,560
That's why I must find
my self-identity elsewhere.


9
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:33,500
I want to develop a drug
to cure the illness that mom and I have.


10
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:36,780
Doctor of Pharmacy studies
last at least six years.


11
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:39,370
Besides, we can't afford
to pay for a private university.


12
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:44,080
There's a scholarship.
I'll work hard for it!


13
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:46,880
But you have to work even harder
than you already do to get in.


14
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:48,250
I know.


15
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:49,750
Go for it, Kusue.


16
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:51,000
Yes.


17
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:52,400
However...


18
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:02,400
"Wind!"


19
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:11,580
However...


20
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:13,720
Oh no!


21
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:15,450
Everyone has been taken out?


22
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:16,410
Don't go out!


23
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:18,250
They won't find us here.


24
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:19,960
There are more down here! Kill them!


25
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:33,520
But, one day...


26
00:01:36,289 --> 00:01:38,930
The warriors! We found the three warriors!


27
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:42,710
That's too violent.


28
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:46,240
Meaningless violence


29
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:51,039
has become my most important
survival skill.


30
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:54,420
Hey! Have you checked the shed over there?


31
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:58,190
Collect all the valuables
before burning them.


32
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:00,270
This looks good.


33
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:01,920
I'll take it.


34
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:05,020
We'll split everything evenly,
hand it over.


35
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:08,270
I feel as if my world is crumbling
under my feet.


36
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:11,680
Not to mention self-identity,


37
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:18,620
even the premises of survival
have changed.


38
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:22,600
The premises of peace and stability...


39
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:32,750
I...


40
00:02:41,079 --> 00:02:50,829
I'M STANDING ON A MILLION LIVES


41
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:55,660
The strange routine in front of me


42
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:59,600
Stepping out of common sense


43
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:08,790
Cutting off the comforting link
to look for the true light


44
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:13,580
My back is against the wall,
I can't give in


45
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:18,170
(Be tough, don't cry, keep going)


46
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,620
The reality is a matter of life or death


47
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:26,079
The enthusiasm within my heart
(surviving in despair)


48
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:30,410
Entering the spiritual world
(fearless, striving)


49
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:34,750
We were born with loneliness


50
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:39,240
Walk side by side,
and be vulnerable no more


51
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:43,790
Even in the face of life's uncertainty


52
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:47,910
The fire of life will never die


53
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:52,190
With courage in my hand, I stand strong


54
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:59,420
Fight for tomorrow


55
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:12,060
It's about time to rest the horses.


56
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:14,240
Let's camp around here.


57
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:16,990
Okay. It's getting dark.


58
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:23,290
It's delicious.


59
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:24,960
Yes, it's really delicious.


60
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:26,400
Thank you.


61
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:29,950
You still don't have any appetite?


62
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:31,550
I took a bite.


63
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:33,909
That was a scary sight to behold.


64
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:34,570
Yes.


65
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,530
What happened back then


66
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:41,510
has been stuck in my head.


67
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:44,750
Don't worry about having no appetite.


68
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:48,240
We don't really get hungry in this world.


69
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,520
I...


70
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,280
I want to protect everyone.


71
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:59,090
I want to protect my partners
and the people in this world.


72
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,760
But I can't even protect myself.


73
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,750
All I do is hold you back.


74
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:06,440
Kusue...


75
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:09,290
Maybe I can't do it at all.


76
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:16,590
I still feel bad about letting a warrior
cook for us.


77
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:20,330
Don't. I'm pretty good at cooking.


78
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:23,060
I'm sure he's only after
the experience points.


79
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:27,990
Once I reached level 10, I could retrieve
woks and other cooking utensils.


80
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:28,900
Level?


81
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:32,280
Yotsuya doesn't seem to be troubled by it
at all.


82
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:33,270
True.


83
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:38,620
Anyway, if a strong person works hard
to level up from the beginning,


84
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:40,790
he could get everything.


85
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:41,790
Warrior.


86
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:44,440
Do you want a refill?


87
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,780
It's about time to start training.


88
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:47,770
Training...


89
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:51,740
You said that she trained you, right?


90
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:52,760
Yes.


91
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:56,810
Even when she went easy on me,
I only won 3 out of 100 fights we had.


92
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:00,250
Once, she went all out


93
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:03,070
and she had to try really hard
to kick my ass without killing me.


94
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,540
It was like living hell.


95
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:08,240
"Try really hard without killing you"?


96
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:11,380
So, when you came to save us...


97
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:16,210
Please let me teach you sword fighting.


98
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,780
Fighting with the warriors


99
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:22,110
means that I can swing my sword
without mercy.


100
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:24,500
Well...


101
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:27,960
No, but if this is the only option,
so be it.


102
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:31,520
Great! This means I can
hack at flesh as I wish!


103
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:34,560
I'm going to tell my dad!


104
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:40,280
Seeing her so thrilled...
I was really worried.


105
00:06:40,659 --> 00:06:41,770
We'll start with you then.


106
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,440
Are you serious?


107
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:48,190
I'll start attacking in five seconds.


108
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:48,850
Okay.


109
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:52,560
What I love to do...


110
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:55,659
is to tear apart living flesh!


111
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:57,550
What's wrong with this person?


112
00:06:57,659 --> 00:07:00,980
She's beautiful but her personality
is quite the opposite.


113
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:06,440
Are you all right, Yuka?


114
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,700
It's terrible.


115
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:12,400
Even though the feeling of pain
is only 1/36 of that in the real world,


116
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:15,210
it still hurts a lot.


117
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:17,760
Well, next is...


118
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:26,830
She can't even lift a long sword.


119
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,790
This will take some time.


120
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:34,370
The modern day Japan I grew up in
has been peaceful and stable.


121
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:37,150
What's wrong?


122
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:42,070
We were attacked by Goblins
when collecting firewood. Makua, he...


123
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:44,250
I was too careless.


124
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:46,060
You got hurt by mere Goblins.


125
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:48,000
How are you fit to be my subordinate?


126
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,850
I'm extremely sorry.


127
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:55,190
Everything I know has collapsed
in this alternate world.


128
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:03,230
My wounds are healing.


129
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,990
You can also use healing magic now?


130
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:12,780
By accelerating the cells' metabolism,
the wounds will heal faster.


131
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:16,980
So, the healing won't surpass
a person's regenerating ability.


132
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:21,730
It's the same with cooking.
You can gain experience without fighting.


133
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:23,600
Isn't that cheating?


134
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,610
Go complain to the system
if you disagree with it.


135
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,510
The system...


136
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:35,590
We can't escape the rules
that the system forced on us.


137
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:40,210
I want to protect everyone.


138
00:08:40,289 --> 00:08:43,070
For that, I must acquire experience


139
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:45,840
and become stronger.


140
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:48,420
You're moving faster now.


141
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:57,060
But it'll still take some time
before you can swing the long sword.


142
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:03,200
I must obtain experience.


143
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:08,520
We have spotted a group of Goblins.


144
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,480
Should we make a detour?


145
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:13,530
No, it's faster to eliminate them.


146
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,010
No.


147
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,010
We'll take care of it.


148
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:23,050
We've been training,
but we've not gained experience so far.


149
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:24,150
It's true.


150
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:27,850
He's been earning experience by using
healing magic. So much for saying that.


151
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:29,660
And you, Kusue?


152
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:32,420
No pressure.


153
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:37,310
Okay. Let's get some experience points!


154
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:45,500
Long swords are not necessary
to fight monsters like Goblins.


155
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:47,270
But I'm still worried.


156
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:50,110
"Fire."


157
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:51,760
"Wind."


158
00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:00,370
Warrior!


159
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:24,990
I'm sorry...


160
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,630
I'm sorry...


161
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,770
I'm sorry, so sorry...


162
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,170
I'm sorry!


163
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:35,000
YOTSUYA YUSUKE
LEVEL FIVE TO SIX


164
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,860
I've been working so hard,
but I'm not upgraded by much.


165
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:43,210
It's because your level
is higher than all of us.


166
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:46,140
Kusue, I heard that you defeated a Goblin.


167
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:49,030
Yes, sort of.


168
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:50,420
You finally made it.


169
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:54,090
I can still feel it in my hands.


170
00:10:56,370 --> 00:10:59,440
That feeling, so soft.


171
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:07,710
I'm so happy that the inner swordswoman
has awaken in her.


172
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:09,600
But...


173
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:11,030
Yes?


174
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:15,080
It's a shame that I didn't get to cut into
the Goblins' flesh with my own hands.


175
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:17,450
Well...


176
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:21,220
Why do you enjoy cutting into
live bodies so much?


177
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:23,430
Good question.


178
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,840
There are so many perks of live bodies.


179
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:27,540
First of all, the toughness of the muscle.


180
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:32,250
Muscles used in combat
are sliced up layer by layer


181
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,150
by the tip of a knife.


182
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:38,060
The feeling of a muscle
gradually turning into dead flesh...


183
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,500
That is...


184
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:44,640
what happens in a sheer moment
when you swing the sword.


185
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:47,710
Moreover, that feeling in your hands...


186
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:51,060
It's amazing!


187
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:59,750
Anyway, there might still be
some Goblins wandering around.


188
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:01,250
I'll go make a round.


189
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:02,710
Bimzberg, Makua!


190
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:03,480
Yes.


191
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:06,760
It's great if
I get to cut into some flesh!


192
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:12,690
According to Ms. Kahabell's father,


193
00:12:14,530 --> 00:12:18,610
when he was teaching sword fighting
to her brother,


194
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:24,360
she heard him say "fighting a living being
is the best way to gain experience."


195
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:27,650
Yet she interpreted it
completely differently.


196
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:32,160
I guess, that's misthinking.
Something kids do.


197
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:33,570
"Misthinking?"


198
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,320
It's like mishearing,
but the brain version.


199
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:36,910
What does that mean?


200
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,960
I'm sorry.


201
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:48,010
But I...


202
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:50,460
I want to protect everyone.


203
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:53,010
I have to stay alive.


204
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:55,310
I want to realize my dream.


205
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:58,130
Therefore, I must...


206
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:00,790
Be brave and take lives.


207
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:03,000
THREAT LEVEL: COOK'S KNOWLEDGE OF
THE MONSTERS' THREAT LEVELS (G TO S)


208
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,330
THE THREAT LEVELS ARE SET ACCORDING TO
A REGULAR SOLDIER'S ABILITY


209
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:05,580
A SOLDIER IN TRAINING IS LEVEL F,
11 TO 50 SOLDIERS EQUALS A LEVEL C MONSTER


210
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:06,950
LEVEL S MONSTERS CAN'T BE DEFEATED EVEN BY
AN INFINITE NUMBER OF SOLDIERS


211
00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:15,920
What's wrong?


212
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:17,750
Calm down.


213
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,410
Gosh!


214
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,000
Did we miss something?


215
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:24,680
It's completely stuck.


216
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:27,080
We almost broke it.


217
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:28,750
Is everyone all right?


218
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:29,580
Yes.


219
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:30,890
That was scary.


220
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:32,140
Bimzberg.


221
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:33,690
I'll handle this.


222
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,200
I'll help.


223
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:38,090
Let's go!


224
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,760
One, two, three!


225
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:47,570
It's coming up a bit.


226
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:49,020
Steady.


227
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:49,790
Okay.


228
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:56,220
Warrior, just a bit more.


229
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:01,110
Great, we got it out!


230
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,570
That was fun.


231
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:09,850
True.


232
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:13,930
All right, let's get going.


233
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:15,930
Understood.


234
00:14:16,530 --> 00:14:17,160
EXPLORE 5% OF THE MAP (NOW 1.76 %)
DELIVER THE CARGO TO RADORPO


235
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:19,970
Time remaining: 5 hours and 15 days.


236
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:22,480
It's really tight.


237
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:28,430
Ms. Kahabell,
there seems to be something in front.


238
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:33,510
An army is attacked by monsters.


239
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,130
Whose army is it?


240
00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:37,070
There are also some civilians


241
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:38,580
and children.


242
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:40,730
We must save them!


243
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:41,980
Are you serious?


244
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:45,360
I don't know if we have enough time.


245
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:47,790
It's better not to take a detour.


246
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,170
Let me out,


247
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,480
I'll go by myself.


248
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:00,760
Wait, Kusue. Calm down.


249
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:04,840
Don't you want to return alive?


250
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,750
The goal is to clear the stage, and you...


251
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:07,710
I'm sorry.


252
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:10,990
But I've said this.


253
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:11,860
What?


254
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:15,870
Humans are not saved
simply by being kept alive.


255
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:19,880
In my opinion,


256
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:22,800
if we don't even save children,


257
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:24,850
nothing else matters.


258
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:27,520
So,


259
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:29,440
I can't do that.


260
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:31,470
What?


261
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:35,720
Is she trying to say "life is meaningless
if you turn your back on kids in need"?


262
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:38,790
Is she trying to be a hero?


263
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:42,680
On the other hand, she's right.


264
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:45,500
This might be an interesting event.


265
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:46,520
Event?


266
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:50,910
Is it a trial from the game master?


267
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:55,420
For instance, that group
might also be heading to Radorpo.


268
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,280
Very well, let's split up into two groups.


269
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:02,820
Hakozaki and I will go to save them.


270
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:05,280
The others, please carry on
with the journey.


271
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:07,130
We're splitting up?


272
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:10,050
We'll be quick
and return as soon as possible.


273
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:12,020
Will this do?


274
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,120
Yes.


275
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:22,450
But, they are almost wiped out!


276
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:29,120
What?


277
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:31,380
They have turned around!


278
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:33,490
Is it because of
the warrior's characteristics?


279
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,640
Mary Cobalt, Cobalt family.


280
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:39,980
Threat level, E minus, it's more powerful
than a regular soldier.


281
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:41,040
That means,


282
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:43,760
it's more powerful
than the both of us combined.


283
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:44,670
Are they...


284
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:46,000
Warriors?


285
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:49,510
We'll stall them,
please attack from behind.


286
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:50,520
Understood!


287
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:55,370
KITE SHIELD, SHORT SWORD


288
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:11,310
No way...


289
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:15,640
We're weaker and outnumbered.
They also attack in packs.


290
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,440
Look behind you!


291
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:22,460
It's not working!


292
00:17:23,069 --> 00:17:24,560
Is it because of the language barrier?


293
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,220
It's not over yet!


294
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:36,860
It's over--


295
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,340
Back-stab!


296
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:47,340
Why am I here?


297
00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:49,850
It's meaningless if I can't fight.


298
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:14,110
It's meaningless
if I need to be protected.


299
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:44,580
LONG SWORD


300
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:55,120
Summoning the long sword
when the enemies let their guards down.


301
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:58,880
Since it's all in a split second,
the long sword isn't held up for long.


302
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:00,390
That's killing two birds with one stone.


303
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:07,240
Hakozaki, her personality has changed.


304
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:09,190
Whatever, anyway...


305
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,280
There's one left.


306
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:13,930
Okay.


307
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:16,760
Hey! Over here!


308
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,210
Warrior!


309
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:32,220
Such a great slab of meat.


310
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:43,550
What's going on?


311
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,510
They must be shy with strangers?


312
00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:48,330
Soldiers and civilians combined,
there is a total of...


313
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:50,280
3, 4, 5, 6 survivors.


314
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:53,950
They are also wounded.
Will they be all right?


315
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:55,510
Yes, I think so.


316
00:19:55,950 --> 00:20:00,730
I just absorbed some magic
from the monster's blood to refill my MP.


317
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,380
Is that possible?


318
00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:05,080
I heard that a bandit
turned into a Berserker


319
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:09,550
by ingesting too much monsters' meat.


320
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:12,480
So I thought,
we should be able to absorb magic.


321
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:15,540
You could have told us sooner.


322
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:18,660
No, this is also the first time
I've tried it.


323
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:19,930
Warriors.


324
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:23,790
Thank you very much.
We're very grateful.


325
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:24,620
You're welcome.


326
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:27,450
Who are you?
Where are you going?


327
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:30,640
We're soldiers from the Deock Empire.


328
00:20:31,090 --> 00:20:36,020
We have an order from the King
to transfer the pagans to Radorpo.


329
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:39,690
QUEST
EXPLORE 5% OF THE MAP
DELIVER THE CARGO TO RADORPO


330
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:45,640
They have violated the ban
on the Altros religion.


331
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:49,290
So they must be executed
on the hills of Radorpo,


332
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:53,850
where most of
the Altros followers are hidden.


333
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:57,170
Radorpo, it's happening!


334
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,270
The cargo is unknown.


335
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:03,050
Is it human beings? Death row prisoners?


336
00:21:03,890 --> 00:21:07,460
Pagan, children, what's this?


337
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:09,770
The cargo is those people?


338
00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:11,720
But, if we deliver them there,


339
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:14,980
these people and that child
will all be killed.


340
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:20,100
Attacks against humans detected,
rank down.


341
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:24,230
Will it be fine if our actions
result in the death of humans?


342
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:28,020
Is this event part of the quest,


343
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,890
or is it a trap that will eliminate us?


344
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:32,690
Which one...


345
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,390
is it?


346
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:40,000
EPISODE 5, THE VALUE OF LIFE


347
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:55,060
In the shiny world


348
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:57,980
Embracing the moment


349
00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:00,810
In the shiny world


350
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:03,780
Now, now, now


351
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,620
How can I become stronger


352
00:22:06,810 --> 00:22:09,540
The reason why I always feel lost


353
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:11,160
Now, now, now


354
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:14,690
Memories sparkle


355
00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:18,410
If I could become you or somebody else


356
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:21,250
Flying birds


357
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,830
Now, now, now


358
00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:26,350
Must share the same wishes


359
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:34,540
Even though all the "ifs" come true


360
00:22:34,610 --> 00:22:37,790
I won't be me again


361
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:44,770
Write down your dream and my name


362
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:47,630
On the beach with an hour hand


363
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:49,630
It'll disappear soon


364
00:22:49,850 --> 00:22:56,470
Even so, I want to be me for once


365
00:22:56,670 --> 00:22:59,330
Unpredictable future


366
00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:02,410
Moving forward with you


367
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:05,340
In the shiny world


368
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:05,910
Embracing the moment

A TROLL APPEARS


372
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:13,000
YOTSUYA:
FIGHT, FLEE


373
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:14,250
DEFEND, TOOLS


374
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,250
YOTSUYA ATTACKS,
IT'S INEFFECTIVE


375
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,250
SHINDO DEFENDS


376
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,250
HAKOZAKI IS TOO SCARED TO FIGHT


377
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,250
TROLL ATTACKS


378
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,790
A SMASH


379
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:21,030
WARRIORS DESTROYED


380
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:24,620
Yotsuya, why have you died?


381
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:26,080
This is way too difficult!

A TROLL APPEARS


385
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:30,580
SPELLS


386
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:31,080
EMOTIONAL SONGS


387
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,160
THE TROLL IS FASCINATED


388
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:33,580
GAME MASTER
FIGHT, FLEE, DEFEND, TOOLS


389
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:34,740
THE TROLL TURNED OVER A NEW PAGE
AND JOINS THE TEAM


390
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:37,480
That's the correct strategy.


391
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:39,270
What a lame game!
