1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:04,540
Boys are really stronger!

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:06,720
I can't even keep track
of how many times I've died.

4
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:09,380
Is that...?

5
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:12,910
It's a log dot.

6
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:14,710
Can we watch it?

7
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:26,700
We finally defeated it.

8
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:30,400
Sorry, I didn't do anything.

9
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:33,760
Don't be. It's okay.

10
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:37,040
It's great that the second player
is our acquaintance.

11
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:39,790
Now, this is already...

12
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,000
Wait! Stop watching it!

13
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:43,510
Shindo.

14
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:48,440
Sorry, can I stay like this for a while?

15
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,370
Sure.

16
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:09,840
I'M STANDING ON A MILLION LIVES

17
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:14,660
The strange routine in front of me

18
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:18,610
Stepping out of common sense

19
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:27,800
Cutting off the comforting link
to look for the true light

20
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:32,580
My back is against the wall,
I can't give in

21
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:37,180
(Be tough, don't cry, keep going)

22
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:40,620
The reality is a matter of life or death

23
00:01:40,789 --> 00:01:45,080
The enthusiasm within my heart
(surviving in despair)

24
00:01:45,229 --> 00:01:49,410
Entering the spiritual world
(fearless, striving)

25
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:53,759
We were born with loneliness

26
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:58,250
Walk side by side,
and be vulnerable no more

27
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:02,790
Even in the face of life's uncertainty

28
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:06,920
The fire of life will never die

29
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:11,200
With courage in my hand, I stand strong

30
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:18,430
Fight for tomorrow

31
00:02:24,829 --> 00:02:25,870
-LET'S WAIT YOTSUYA IS OFF DUTY.
-UNDERSTOOD

32
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:26,250
WHAT IS IT?

33
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,950
WE CHATTED ON THE WAY HOME.

34
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:32,250
Anyway, if we get more people to survive
in that world,

35
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:34,240
it will do us all some good.

36
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:37,579
I think it suits me well.

37
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:39,910
Really?

38
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:44,250
He really said that? How interesting!

39
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:45,980
Iu, what is it?

40
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:48,990
By the way, Hoshi,

41
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:53,060
you and Yotsuya who isn't in any club,
went to the same primary school?

42
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:58,540
We did, but he only transferred to
our school in the winter of the sixth grade.

43
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,450
What do you think about him?

44
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:03,720
I don't remember much about him.

45
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:06,070
He barely talked.

46
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,380
Why?

47
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:09,740
I had a chance to speak with him.

48
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:12,660
I'm just wondering
what kind of person he is.

49
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:13,250
THAT'S INTERESTING.

50
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:14,960
I WONDER IF HE HAD SOME KIND OF TRAUMA.

51
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,430
I've never met anyone like him.

52
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:20,940
He's like an unknown organism.

53
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,160
Damn it.

54
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,090
I wish I were in the woods.

55
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:29,520
It's so loud running on concrete pavement.

56
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:46,160
If that's the final goal for us,

57
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:51,880
let's say we'll have to fight
to protect this city,

58
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:53,500
why does it have to be me?

59
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:57,720
Why was I chosen
when I hate this city more than anyone?

60
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:02,040
What?

61
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:02,260
INCOMING CALL, GAME MASTER

62
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:05,450
Yotsuya Yusuke, it's been half a day.
Good evening.

63
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:07,230
Game master?

64
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,290
What's wrong with your voice?

65
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:10,490
Also, how did you make this call?

66
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:13,930
No,
this should be a piece of cake for you.

67
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:15,710
Here's a quest for you.

68
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:19,079
Pick up a girl I've designated.

69
00:04:20,329 --> 00:04:20,870
What?

70
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:32,640
I came here as you instructed.

71
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:37,770
The outcome is directly related
to the success rate of the next quest.

72
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,130
I've never been to this high school!

73
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:42,210
Trespassing like this...

74
00:04:42,659 --> 00:04:43,360
Go to the second floor.

75
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:44,490
Second floor?

76
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,570
The light is on.

77
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:54,409
LADIES' ROOM

78
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:57,110
I have to pick up a girl
in the ladies' room at this hour?

79
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,250
What the heck is going on?

80
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,790
Which one?

81
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:09,350
The one in the middle, with glasses.

82
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,870
Right, it can't be those next to her.

83
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,240
Can you see me from there?

84
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:15,950
Call me back when it's done!

85
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,840
Well, excuse me.

86
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:23,740
What? Who are you?

87
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:27,940
Well, how should I put it?

88
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:29,040
Seriously...

89
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:32,470
Picking up a girl for the first time?
This is witnessing school bullying.

90
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:36,580
This is the ladies' room, get out!

91
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:38,220
Oh no!

92
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:43,050
No, instead of taking my photo,
they take photos of her naked,

93
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:45,930
the worst case scenario
is that she might kill herself.

94
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:47,930
That means I fail the quest.

95
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:51,390
In other words,
the success rate of the next quest...

96
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:53,510
The death rate will go up.

97
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:57,460
Hey! Give it back to me!

98
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:03,550
Why? Why did you break the phone?

99
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:08,290
Because I don't know
where you store the pictures.

100
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:11,060
This should boost my success rate.

101
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:12,160
Who are you?

102
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:14,600
Why?

103
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:16,780
Hold on...

104
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,700
They might have already taken her photos.

105
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:23,270
Wait! I have nothing to do with this!

106
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,800
I didn't film anything!
You'll know if you take a look!

107
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:29,770
It might be in a hidden folder!

108
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:34,240
He's so scary. That's gross.
What the heck is wrong with this guy?

109
00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:38,060
Good job! I'm so cool.

110
00:06:38,409 --> 00:06:42,850
I might even have
my first ever girlfriend!

111
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:44,530
Only one left.

112
00:06:44,909 --> 00:06:45,810
Where is it?

113
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:58,080
Is it over there?

114
00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:00,380
This is ridiculous!

115
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,750
Awesome!

116
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:04,700
In this way, the success rate will go up!

117
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:05,760
Hey you!

118
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,560
Ouch!

119
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:11,700
Well, I think I'm stronger than you all.

120
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,570
Do you want to keep this up?

121
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:17,150
What's next?
I've never been in a fight with girls.

122
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:18,830
Gross!

123
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:19,750
The worst ever!

124
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:22,000
Damn it, what's wrong with this dude?

125
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:23,610
Let's call the police!

126
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:25,180
What? Call the police?

127
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:32,780
PLEASE DO NOT FLUSH ANYTHING
OTHER THAN TOILET PAPER, THANK YOU.

128
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:38,550
Well, I just passed by and saved you.

129
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:40,159
About that...

130
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:40,659
LADIES' ROOM

131
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:43,790
How can you be here by coincidence
if this is a ladies' room?

132
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:46,380
No. Thank you very much.

133
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,230
What do I do?

134
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:52,560
Now I have to be alone with this person.

135
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:02,220
He's even following me.
Can't you just go home?

136
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:05,910
Great, I'm a perfect bodyguard.

137
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:09,280
Boys must walk on the side of the cars.

138
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:14,530
Well, just asking,
were you being bullied?

139
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:17,420
I say, schools in the city are awful.

140
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:21,490
No, it wasn't bullying.
They were seeking a revenge.

141
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:26,720
I and the girl who took pictures,
we were playing Miko streaming.

142
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,790
Oh, the Mikkou animation.

143
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:32,789
Exactly. I accidentally let slip
during the streaming

144
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:40,870
that I know a girl who only acts cute
when speaking with boys.

145
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:43,720
She thought I was talking about her.

146
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:49,080
But anyway, I was talking about her.

147
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:50,570
You actually did bitch about her.

148
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:57,110
But I didn't mention any names.

149
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:02,240
Oh... so, that's what happened.

150
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:05,060
What do I do with a crying girl?

151
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:07,040
Can I hug her?

152
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:10,280
But I'm not the boyfriend.
Would I get arrested?

153
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:12,640
The game master didn't call me back.

154
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:14,690
Did I clear the stage?

155
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,760
I'm all right now.

156
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:19,090
I see.

157
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,060
I should walk her home.

158
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:21,700
Well, see you.

159
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:23,360
Go home then.

160
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:25,490
Hey.

161
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:26,170
What?

162
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:29,830
There's a simulation game called One Star
that grooms male idols.

163
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:32,480
It's very popular among us.

164
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:33,700
Oh?

165
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,830
The protagonist is a female producer.

166
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:39,680
The game is to establish relationships
with various men and work as a producer.

167
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:40,740
Oh?

168
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:45,010
If you can imitate the behavior
of cute guys in the game,

169
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:49,860
you'll become more popular, Yotsuya.

170
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:54,180
She's not my type. She's an Otaku.

171
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,840
I'm not doing this for you.
Don't get the wrong idea.

172
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,640
I've wasted two weeks on this.

173
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:05,560
I'm hungry.

174
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:08,160
It's the next stage?

175
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:09,390
Great to see you.

176
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:10,670
Good evening.

177
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:16,510
What? What's this?

178
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:18,880
She really is the fourth player.

179
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:21,590
I mean...

180
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:23,510
Listen.

181
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:25,780
What is she hiding from?

182
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:32,590
Nice to meet you. Morning.

183
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:39,120
MAGICIAN: A MAGICAL BUG AMBER IS
EMBEDDED IN THE WEAPON,

184
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,450
WHEN USING MAGIC,
THE CORRESPONDING MP IS CONSUMED

185
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:41,700
THE MP SLOT FITS ALL MAGIC, SLOTS VARY
FROM ATTRIBUTE TO ATTRIBUTE

186
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:43,080
ONE MAY DETERMINE THE POWER OF THE MAGIC
WITHIN THE AVAILABLE RANGE

187
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:48,130
The fourth player,
Tokitate Yuka's occupation is...

188
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:51,810
Magician (heat).

189
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:53,260
Magic.

190
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:56,290
TOKITATE YUKA, MAGICIAN (HEAT) LEVEL 1
ABLE TO USE HEAT MAGIC

191
00:10:56,430 --> 00:10:57,750
Magic.

192
00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:03,060
For now on, the revival time is extended
from 30 seconds to 40 seconds.

193
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:04,690
It's harder now.

194
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,620
Here's your quest.

195
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,450
QUEST: EXPLORE FIVE PERCENT OF THE MAP
BRING THE CARGO TO RADORPO

196
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:10,100
What's the cargo?

197
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:10,920
See you.

198
00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:17,170
That creep stays the same.

199
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:19,890
Hello.

200
00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:23,390
Who are you? Why are you doing this?

201
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:25,630
What do you want from me?

202
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:29,910
That wasn't a coincidence either.
You were stalking me?

203
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:31,700
You creepy stalker!

204
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:32,660
Pervert!

205
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,300
Stalker!

206
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:36,320
No! No...

207
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:38,000
Anyway, calm down.

208
00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:40,250
Please hear us out.

209
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:43,720
Destroying high school girls' smart phones...

210
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:47,130
And flushing the fragments
down the toilet.

211
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:50,700
After that incident,
I talked with the other girls

212
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:54,330
and we thought he was a pervert
who was there to install spy cameras.

213
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,410
No, there's a reason for that.

214
00:11:58,880 --> 00:11:59,490
Let's go.

215
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:00,730
Yes.

216
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:10,700
Let's start with exploring
five percent of the map.

217
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:13,170
It'll be faster if we split up.

218
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:19,120
Okay. We can each see our own map data.

219
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:20,320
Understood?

220
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,320
Sort of.

221
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,290
By the way,

222
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:24,760
you don't have to be so polite with me.

223
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:26,620
Aren't you actually one year older,
Yuka?

224
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:30,130
No, you're a senior in this world, Shindo.

225
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:31,510
Just call me Iu.

226
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:34,340
Let's go. I'll stay with you
before you get used to this place.

227
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:37,120
She's... so cool.

228
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,380
Shindo is "Magic Purple."

229
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:43,140
A mysterious power that leads to hope,
Magician Purple.

230
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:45,440
Tall, fit, and good looking.

231
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:49,200
She's the first player
who has survived till now.

232
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,210
About what Yotsuya did...

233
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:55,870
You said you spoke to those three girls.

234
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:58,220
Weren't you bullied by them?

235
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:01,150
Well, about that...

236
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:06,010
You made up with the three girls
who wanted to take naked photos of you.

237
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,810
Why?

238
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:13,900
Well, Iu,
you might find it hard to understand.

239
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:20,810
I've always been cautious
not to give anyone a reason to bully me.

240
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:24,680
But, I did give them a reason to attack me.

241
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:29,210
That's why I made Yotsuya our mutual enemy

242
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:34,670
so I can make up with those girls.

243
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:37,830
I thought I won't see him again anyway.

244
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,790
She will dislike me now.

245
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:46,770
After all, you need to get along
with your classmates.

246
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:50,540
Yes... Right?
There's nothing else I can do.

247
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:54,940
By the way,
why did you say I won't understand?

248
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:58,580
It's because I don't think
you would be a victim of bullying.

249
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:01,580
You got half of it right.

250
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:05,110
I've made an effort as well.

251
00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:08,730
Cosmetics, studying, sports.

252
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:13,490
I want to live my student life
to the fullest.

253
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:17,550
But, it could also be that
I'm quite nosy.

254
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,870
Bullying is so boring.

255
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:22,370
I always intervene when I come across it.

256
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,370
I'll keep doing so.

257
00:14:24,950 --> 00:14:28,260
Don't you get frightened?

258
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,510
Who would dare lay a finger on me?

259
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:32,420
That's not what I mean.

260
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:34,540
What if you lose friends?

261
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:37,780
People like them aren't real friends.

262
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:41,210
That's so... cool.

263
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:46,580
In comparison, I'm so narrow-minded.

264
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,810
What's wrong?

265
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:50,030
Please marry me!

266
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:52,100
What?

267
00:14:57,950 --> 00:14:59,790
We didn't get very far.

268
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:02,090
It's only the first day.

269
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,040
You're right.

270
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:06,190
I have a feeling that they're ignoring me.

271
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:10,540
Yotsuya! Watch out!

272
00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:20,700
Giant insect corpse?

273
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:22,840
Wait, listen!

274
00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:26,840
A centipede. Gross!

275
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:32,440
A ball?

276
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,380
It's a pill-bug!

277
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,870
It's too powerful!

278
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:44,380
With a cook's skills, I should know
its name and threatening level.

279
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:50,160
Demon bug Kadumured.

280
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,570
Combining all parameters,
its threatening level is D-.

281
00:15:52,810 --> 00:15:55,490
So the pill-bugs are male
and centipedes are female?

282
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,040
Leave this to me!

283
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:01,090
Although I'm not sure what's going on,
this is my era!

284
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:04,290
Finally! Although I never thought
this could ever happen.

285
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:05,830
Magician Pink!

286
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,120
Magician Purple!

287
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:08,370
We're the magicians!

288
00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:13,720
Since kindergarten, it's always been
my dream to become a magician.

289
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,920
Flame of the Red Lotus!

290
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:19,500
The kindergarten mini me,
can you see me now?

291
00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:21,240
Your dream has come true!

292
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:26,580
Burn with the Flame of the Red Lotus!
Magical fire!

293
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,500
TOKITATE YUKA, MAGIC POWER FULLY CONSUMED

294
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:33,080
INCREASED AIR TEMPERATURE AT 10CM RADIUS
AROUND THE TIP OF THE WAND BY 20℃

295
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:34,470
So warm.

296
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:39,490
Dead!

297
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:42,320
That's level one magic?

298
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:47,330
By the way, why am I the creep now
when I actually saved her?

299
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:50,610
By the way,

300
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:53,710
she seemed to have taught me
how to become popular.

301
00:16:56,470 --> 00:16:57,870
Does that mean

302
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,960
I'm too lame?

303
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:03,030
That's embarrassing.

304
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:05,540
I was so brave in protecting her!

305
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:07,400
Why didn't I become cooler?

306
00:17:07,829 --> 00:17:08,690
Darn it!

307
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:11,920
I got it!

308
00:17:12,339 --> 00:17:16,230
I might actually be unpopular.

309
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:20,700
Shindo said
that she likes one of the Yotsuya.

310
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:23,140
I'll observe for now.

311
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:25,250
For a month or two,

312
00:17:25,930 --> 00:17:27,480
or maybe three.

313
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:31,090
That's ridiculous.

314
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:32,900
This guy is so strong.

315
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:38,650
This dude is like Mr. Tatsuoni.

316
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,420
Isn't this Gap-Moe?

317
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:43,590
Please step back.

318
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:45,450
Wind magic won't work on it.

319
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,280
Got it.

320
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,050
Is it poisonous? Does it have stingers?

321
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:53,420
It's okay. There aren't such organs inside.

322
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:54,900
If so...

323
00:17:55,730 --> 00:17:57,440
This is the blind spot!

324
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:03,960
Great! Now, chop off the legs.

325
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,450
I'm all worn out.

326
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:12,040
How do we defeat this?

327
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,680
There's something I'd like to try.

328
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:15,920
Hakozaki.

329
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:17,740
What?

330
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:21,970
I want to see if I can lift the sword
using your hands.

331
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:24,480
What does that mean?

332
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:26,180
Here.

333
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:33,810
In this world, we're only allowed to
pick up our own weapons.

334
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:37,170
Indeed, if it's Kusue
who's holding the weapon...

335
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,960
See! I can hold it now.

336
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:43,220
I'll count to three before we hack at it.

337
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,100
Three...

338
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:47,710
A bit to that side.

339
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:49,490
Two, one!

340
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:53,190
HAKOZAKI KUSUE LEVEL FIVE TO SIX

341
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:57,620
What happened?

342
00:18:57,790 --> 00:18:59,900
Iu hit me!

343
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:02,580
What's wrong with that kid?

344
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:04,410
It's the kid from the Shindo family.

345
00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:06,240
Right, that family...

346
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:14,930
What happened?

347
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,320
Did you get into a fight?

348
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:29,400
He's always bugging me so I made him cry.

349
00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:31,800
How can you do that? You're a girl.

350
00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:34,860
You won't make any friends
if you're too fierce.

351
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,670
I don't need friends.

352
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:40,170
Why don't you be my friend?

353
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:44,980
My name is Sayuri﻿, and you?

354
00:19:46,370 --> 00:19:46,940
Iu.

355
00:19:48,810 --> 00:19:50,910
Sayuri, today, I...

356
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:53,090
Sayuri.

357
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:56,160
Sayuri, Sayuri.

358
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,370
Poor Sayuri.

359
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:08,000
She's a nice girl, apart from that face.

360
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:09,220
You're right.

361
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:12,390
It was all because she was ugly.

362
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:13,760
Stop it.

363
00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:16,800
It's wonderful that Iu is so beautiful!

364
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:20,940
You're spoiling her, she's only five years old.

365
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:26,480
It was all because she was ugly.

366
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,660
It was all because of that.

367
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,050
Did I wake you up?

368
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:42,560
I tried my best to stay quiet.

369
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:46,200
What are you doing?

370
00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:48,710
Working out. I grew fond of it lately.

371
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:53,850
What? Shindo seems to be unlike herself.

372
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:57,380
Right, it was the same back then.

373
00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:00,470
She's a queen in the school.

374
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:03,650
It's impossible to picture her crying.

375
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:13,390
By the way, you cried back then.

376
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:17,700
I saw that in one of the previous records
in the log dot.

377
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:21,140
Why are you bringing that up?

378
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,780
It just came to my mind.

379
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:27,790
You seem as if you don't pay
anyone any attention, but you do.

380
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:30,160
Do I?

381
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:34,690
Yotsuya, help me!

382
00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:40,090
EPISODE 3, HELP ME

383
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:55,160
In the shiny world

384
00:21:55,530 --> 00:21:58,080
Embracing the moment

385
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:00,910
In the shiny world

386
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:03,880
Now, now, now

387
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:06,720
How can I become stronger

388
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:09,620
The reason why I always feel lost

389
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:11,290
Now, now, now

390
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:14,790
Memories sparkle

391
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:18,410
If I could become you or somebody else

392
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:21,330
Flying birds

393
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:22,930
Now, now, now

394
00:22:23,130 --> 00:22:26,450
Must share the same wishes

395
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:34,640
Even though all the "ifs" come true

396
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:37,890
I won't be me again

397
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:44,870
Write down your dream and my name

398
00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:47,730
On the beach with an hour hand

399
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,730
It'll disappear soon

400
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:56,570
Even so, I want to be me for once

401
00:22:56,770 --> 00:22:59,430
Unpredictable future

402
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:02,510
Moving forward with you

403
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:05,440
In the shiny world

404
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:06,040
Embracing the moment

GAME MASTER

407
00:23:10,330 --> 00:23:13,450
Please reach ten times the number
of viewers in the next streaming.

408
00:23:14,130 --> 00:23:16,370
Hello everyone, this is Yukario.

409
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:19,540
Number of viewing: 20.
It's not even close.

410
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:20,980
Let me do it.

411
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:22,890
No...

412
00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:25,910
Ten times. I don't think I can make it.

413
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,250
I said that I can help.

414
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:30,320
After all, Iu is a model.

415
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:33,530
If someone as pretty as Iu shows up,
people are going to compare us.

416
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:35,450
I will have to strip.

417
00:23:35,610 --> 00:23:36,570
Calm down!

418
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:38,210
I have an idea!

419
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,030
