1
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:25,100
Even though I'll revive,


2
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:26,860
this is still so scary.


3
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:48,330
Okay.


4
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:50,940
I don't even know
how many times I've fallen.


5
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,940
Can't be bothered to look.
I'm more focused like this.


6
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:27,760
This is our new transfer student,
Yotsuya Yusuke.


7
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:34,880
I'm Yotsuya Yusuke, from Kumamoto.


8
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:55,350
Get into groups for the field trip.


9
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:58,870
Form groups of six with your friends.


10
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:02,490
Hey, count Yotsuya into
one of your groups.


11
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:04,680
There are only five of you, right?


12
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:07,560
Are you serious?


13
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:19,920
I'll upgrade my level, see you.


14
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:59,180
This is not meant to be climbed?


15
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:03,560
I made it, game master!


16
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:18,780
I'M STANDING ON A MILLION LIVES


17
00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:23,620
The strange routine in front of me


18
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:27,550
Stepping out of common sense


19
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:36,740
Cutting off the comforting link
to look for the true light


20
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:41,540
My back is against the wall,
I can't give in


21
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:46,120
(Be tough, don't cry, keep going)


22
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:49,579
The reality is a matter of life or death


23
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:54,040
The enthusiasm within my heart
(surviving in despair)


24
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:58,370
Entering the spiritual world
(fearless, striving)


25
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:02,700
We were born with loneliness


26
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:07,190
Walk side by side,
and be vulnerable no more


27
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:11,750
Even in the face of life's uncertainty


28
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:15,860
The fire of life will never die


29
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,140
With courage in my hand, I stand strong


30
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:27,370
Fight for tomorrow


31
00:04:44,909 --> 00:04:48,500
This is a bird's-eye-view map.


32
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:55,250
There's light. Is it a log dot?


33
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:09,690
10 years and 3 months,
thank you for serving my family.


34
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:14,590
Bimzberg, the fighter.


35
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:17,900
Those three Deock soldiers...


36
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:22,620
I'll send them on your way
in a few days


37
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:24,690
so you can avenge yourself.


38
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:27,520
You have my word.


39
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:35,980
It happened in here?


40
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,210
That's so delicious.


41
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:42,260
Mr. Bimzberg...


42
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:43,540
One,


43
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:45,540
two, three.


44
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:53,730
I convinced Mr. Bimzberg to join us.


45
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:04,770
But, it's...


46
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:09,490
This is the second time
I've pushed the carriage with you.


47
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:11,630
That's right.


48
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:11,790
However short,
you were my comrade-in-arms.


49
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:14,160
Almost there. Keep going.


50
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:15,230
Yes.


51
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:19,260
My comrade-in-arms.


52
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:26,000
I couldn't even see you one last time.


53
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:34,730
Thank you.


54
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:37,550
In the end, I'm still my old self.


55
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:39,890
Farewell.


56
00:06:48,570 --> 00:07:16,540
I'm just a passer-by to everyone.


57
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:17,560
So annoying!


58
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,530
The vampire bats are so annoying!


59
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:26,960
Hang in there!


60
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:40,400
It's worth killing.


61
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:42,159
Look. That thing's arm.


62
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:45,909
I see.


63
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:49,880
We can't leave without taking that key?


64
00:07:55,270 --> 00:08:00,340
You're indeed the one
with the most potential.


65
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:04,400
Thank you,
I've been training in a competitive sport


66
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:06,960
using a racket to hit a small ball
for two years now.


67
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:08,930
Why did you give up?


68
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:12,980
You should stick to that sport of yours.


69
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:19,680
Shindo should be able
to qualify for the quarterfinals.


70
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:23,110
It's a shame that you lost
in the first game.


71
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,200
Were you too nervous
because it's the last round?


72
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,190
No.


73
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:29,790
Poor physical endurance
is the weakness of a magician.


74
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:34,610
And it stays the same
when we return to the real world.


75
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:39,380
It's the fault of that half-face creep.


76
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:41,000
It's not fair.


77
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:46,380
Yes, I'll keep training
when I go to high school.


78
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:05,580
Ms. Kahabell!


79
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:07,920
No way...


80
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:12,480
Ms. Kahabell died?


81
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,750
No...


82
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,230
I can't beat this guy.


83
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:38,890
It stopped?


84
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,440
When you reach level 10,


85
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,170
the time stops for everyone
but you and the game master.


86
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:50,400
Level 10, occupation change.


87
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:51,360
Congratulations.


88
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:53,720
You have reached level 10.


89
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,560
Occupation roulette starts.


90
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,660
Last time, it was the magician.


91
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:00,560
It's too late! If this happened sooner...


92
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:03,580
If it were a few seconds ago,
Ms. Kahabell wouldn't have to die!


93
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:04,690
It starts now.


94
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,950
After that guy presses start,
you only have a few seconds


95
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:12,560
before the time starts running again.


96
00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:15,440
If the enemy was in front of you,


97
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,330
just run


98
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:24,000
towards it.


99
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:27,350
Shindo Iu, warrior (sword).


100
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:30,520
Die!


101
00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:32,080
"UPGRADE BONUS":
HAPPENS AT OCCUPATION CHANGE


102
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,410
WHEN PARAMETERS OF
YOUR PREVIOUS OCCUPATION EXCEED 100%.


103
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,660
HALF OF THE DIFFERENCE
IS ADDED TO THE NEXT PARAMETERS.


104
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:36,040
THE MAGICIAN'S PARAMETERS WILL BE WEAKENED
BUT MAGIC REMAINS AFTER OCCUPATION CHANGE.


105
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:39,610
It's so hard!


106
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,760
I got my left hand back.


107
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,960
Annoying bats!


108
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:24,500
Hat...


109
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:24,890
MAGICIAN'S HAT


110
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:26,820
And the shield.


111
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:31,340
What?


112
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,970
A wound. Ms. Kahabell injured it?


113
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:37,280
My sword can't hurt it at all.


114
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:42,540
To win, we must aim for the vital organs
for a fatal death.


115
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:44,480
Do you know any?


116
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:46,650
Well... the neck?


117
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:48,480
Partially correct.


118
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:51,990
But, many armors can protect the neck.


119
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:55,040
The most vital organ is the heart.


120
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:56,850
But...


121
00:11:57,020 --> 00:12:00,190
Indeed, the chest is protected by
both the armor and bones.


122
00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:03,910
However, as long as it's not
a full body armor, you can spot a seam.


123
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:07,010
From top to bottom, attack like this.


124
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:10,290
From bottom to top, attack like this.


125
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:15,530
To bridge the gap between
the absolute strength of men and women,


126
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,000
you'll need techniques like this,
sword fighting techniques.


127
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,690
Right, that's its ribs.


128
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:24,720
If its heart is located
where a human heart is...


129
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:27,850
I'll give it a go!


130
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:36,740
Ouch!


131
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:04,800
It seems to be getting brighter.


132
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:08,530
I'm almost there.


133
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:12,080
I think it's fair that
not everyone is born equal.


134
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:14,540
HEADQUARTERS


135
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:15,690
A bear!


136
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:36,350
Therefore, the value of a life can be
graded by points and ranked accordingly.


137
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,310
Why was I born?


138
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,920
Why was I chosen as one of the players?


139
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:45,120
What am I here for?


140
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,010
Who are you?


141
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:52,080
That's so impressive, Shindo.


142
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:54,160
My partners are my strength.


143
00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:58,720
The world that we live in,
can only be changed with our own hands.


144
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:01,060
Who are you?


145
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:04,630
While I'm still healthy,
I'm going to help everyone.


146
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:06,940
I think that


147
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:09,820
if we won't even save children,


148
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:12,890
everything is meaningless.


149
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:14,830
You are...


150
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:28,280
Who are you?


151
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:35,550
What's the meaning of my existence?
Why was I chosen as one of the players?


152
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:37,820
Look at all the current players.


153
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,520
Everything is carefully arranged.


154
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,970
Even the results of
the occupation roulette.


155
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,720
One of the possibilities


156
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:51,040
is to make me a guiding role.


157
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:54,570
I'll do my best to stay vigorous.
I have to.


158
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:59,640
It's because, at least for now,
in terms of battling abilities,


159
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,200
I'm the strongest.


160
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:05,930
Yotsuya!


161
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:07,190
Mr. Yotsuya.


162
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:14,390
Yotsuya.


163
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:16,680
You're so slow.


164
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:23,840
Am I?


165
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:25,260
Mr. Yotsuya!


166
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:27,900
Ms. Kahabell, Ms. Kahabell...


167
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:30,900
She's down there. Please save her!


168
00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:45,490
I mean, the lives of others
are not important in a quest.


169
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:48,240
He doesn't hesitate at all
to save Ms. Kahabell.


170
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:52,000
Wonderful! Yotsuya finally understands it!


171
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:05,810
Ms. Kahabell! This is great!


172
00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:08,780
Am I still alive?


173
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:10,830
Ouch.


174
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:14,070
The wound...


175
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:16,160
It was the Warrior.


176
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:28,880
He absorbed the blood of
the monster in the cave to heal you.


177
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:33,060
Before he ran out of blood,


178
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:34,960
he repeated the treatment numerous times.


179
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:39,530
He passed out right after
he finished healing you.


180
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,680
He has been like this ever since.


181
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:50,350
Warriors actually fall asleep with
eyes rolled back when they are tired?


182
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:52,840
His legs are also stretched out.


183
00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:55,100
I'll go and get everyone.


184
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:55,920
Okay.


185
00:17:13,829 --> 00:17:15,560
Why did you do that?


186
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:17,670
No reason.


187
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,130
What? Are any of you
in a relationship with him?


188
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:21,480
No, no.


189
00:17:21,569 --> 00:17:22,349
I thought so.


190
00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:26,310
He and I are somewhat similar.


191
00:17:26,569 --> 00:17:28,580
Similar? How?


192
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,430
Right, they are both weirdos.


193
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:32,350
We both give it our all.


194
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,950
Knowing who we are, how much we can do,


195
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:43,400
where and what to achieve to fulfill
the meaning of life and die in content.


196
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:47,840
In my country, there's an alliance system
based on the ranking of knights.


197
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:49,720
There are a total of 3000 participants.


198
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:51,820
The top 100 gets to be knighted.


199
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:53,520
I was in the 70th place.


200
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,840
You were the 70th among 3000 participants?


201
00:17:55,930 --> 00:17:57,320
That's amazing!


202
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:04,740
My father came in second, my oldest brother,
the eighth, and my second brother, fifteenth.


203
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:10,810
As an ordinary person, however hard
I tried, I can't bridge the gap.


204
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:14,780
Is that the reason why you joined us?


205
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:16,420
That's one of the reasons.


206
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:19,120
Most importantly,
I want to cut into flesh.


207
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:20,450
She's too persistent.


208
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:25,190
If I wish to turn things around,
I'll have to work on actual combats.


209
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:30,330
My father once said, "a combat is
like practice striking 1000 times."


210
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:34,720
He's right. In other words,
I must cut into living flesh.


211
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:36,750
That was what she meant.


212
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:40,260
Where are those people?


213
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:44,170
They took the longer route.
We should be able to catch up soon.


214
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:48,150
We have about 7 days and 10 hours left.


215
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:49,880
Will we be okay?


216
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,020
I can't say for sure.


217
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,200
When is he going to wake up?


218
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:00,510
I got it wrong!


219
00:19:01,290 --> 00:19:02,250
You're scaring me.


220
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,210
What's wrong?


221
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:04,590
What is it?


222
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:10,240
Explain yourself. What's wrong?


223
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:11,210
The cargo.


224
00:19:12,010 --> 00:19:14,060
What would you say is
the definition of a cargo?


225
00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:17,030
The definition of a cargo...
Something like a merchandise.


226
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:19,000
Exactly, "valuable objects."


227
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,640
"Objects that requires a recipient."


228
00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:22,700
"Objects that are worth transporting."


229
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,830
Tell me, how would you define
a village chief?


230
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:29,060
A village chief? Why?


231
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:32,510
From our previous quests? I think it means
the leader of a village.


232
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:36,730
That's right. The quest in the third week
was "complete village chief's commission."


233
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:40,990
But, it did not mention any specific names
of a person or a village.


234
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:42,670
What are you trying to say?


235
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:45,640
For example, in the third week,
the village chief's commission.


236
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:49,630
It could have been any village
and any commission.


237
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:52,400
Shindo,
what's the quest of the first week?


238
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:54,650
Eliminate one Goblin.


239
00:19:55,150 --> 00:20:00,990
We have always been fighting
native Merry Goblins.


240
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:04,760
But, there might be
other species of Goblins in this world.


241
00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:06,980
I guess so.


242
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:10,570
As long as we eliminate it,
perhaps, the species don't matter.


243
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:11,970
What about the second week?


244
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:14,720
Discover two villages.


245
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:19,100
Similarly, it could have been any village.


246
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:21,650
Indeed, it didn't specifically say
what to look for.


247
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:24,040
And we cleared the stage.


248
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:24,720
Yes.


249
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:26,160
That's it.


250
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:29,360
Anyway, as long as we deliver an object
that can be considered a cargo,


251
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:33,810
regardless of the object,
we may be able to finish the quest.


252
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:34,720
So?


253
00:20:35,290 --> 00:20:37,800
Now, back to the definition of a cargo.


254
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:42,330
According to the definition,
death row prisoners may not be it.


255
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:45,960
We also don't know
if there's a recipient in Radorpo.


256
00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:48,190
Moreover,
there's no mention of money exchange.


257
00:20:50,210 --> 00:20:53,390
You're saying
that we have been wasting our time?


258
00:20:55,670 --> 00:20:56,480
But...


259
00:20:57,350 --> 00:20:59,410
But, wait a minute, Yotsuya!


260
00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:01,750
Are you planning to abandon them again?


261
00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:03,690
You're going to leave the three
death row prisoners with them?


262
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,320
There's a kid!


263
00:21:05,670 --> 00:21:09,320
Unlike us, if they die in here,
they are dead for sure!


264
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:11,210
Well, no.


265
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:15,290
It's still possible that
the cargo is the prisoners.


266
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:20,070
If we abandon them,
the quest may still be deemed as failed.


267
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:22,570
What do we do?


268
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:27,980
It's better that we split up.


269
00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:31,450
What? What's going on?


270
00:21:31,610 --> 00:21:34,900
It feels like a breakup
before love is even professed.


271
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:40,030
EPISODE 7, WARRIOR OF LIGHT
AND BYSTANDERS OF DARKNESS


272
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:55,060
In the shiny world


273
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:57,980
Embracing the moment


274
00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:00,810
In the shiny world


275
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:03,780
Now, now, now


276
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,620
How can I become stronger


277
00:22:06,810 --> 00:22:09,540
The reason why I always feel lost


278
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:11,160
Now, now, now


279
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:14,690
Memories sparkle


280
00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:18,410
If I could become you or somebody else


281
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:21,250
Flying birds


282
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,830
Now, now, now


283
00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:26,350
Must share the same wishes


284
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:34,540
Even though all the "ifs" come true


285
00:22:34,610 --> 00:22:37,790
I won't be me again


286
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:44,770
Write down your dream and my name


287
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:47,630
On the beach with an hour hand


288
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:49,630
It'll disappear soon


289
00:22:49,850 --> 00:22:56,470
Even so, I want to be me for once


290
00:22:56,670 --> 00:22:59,330
Unpredictable future


291
00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:02,410
Moving forward with you


292
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:05,340
In the shiny world


293
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:05,910
Embracing the moment

295
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,590
Explore the underground labyrinth!


296
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:14,880
What's this?


297
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:15,830
DOOR TO TWO-DIMENSIONAL WORLD AHEAD


298
00:23:16,290 --> 00:23:17,910
Can Tsubasa be over there?


299
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:19,140
I'll go check it out!


300
00:23:22,990 --> 00:23:24,080
MASCOT HEAVEN AHEAD


301
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:25,710
It's definitely a trap.


302
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:27,090
What? Where's Kusue?


303
00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:31,910
Be careful,
there may be more traps ahead.


304
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,740
DANGER! HELL OF FLESH-CUTTING AHEAD


305
00:23:35,370 --> 00:23:38,890
Wonderful! I can make dad proud
by cutting all the flesh!
