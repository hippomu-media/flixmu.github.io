1
00:00:01,270 --> 00:00:04,080
It's not an imaginary world,


2
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:08,410
it's a planet located in the same spot
as the Earth in a parallel world.


3
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:14,900
People in this world


4
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:18,730
are not virtual characters,
but human beings in a parallel world.


5
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:44,620
I killed someone.


6
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:45,690
Really?


7
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:49,670
ONE STAR


8
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:55,970
I killed a human?


9
00:00:58,260 --> 00:00:58,950
That's huge!


10
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:06,130
I hate humans.


11
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:15,600
I've always wanted them to be destroyed.


12
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:20,050
But now, having killed just one person


13
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:23,200
already makes my heart palpitate.


14
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:26,260
It's like a rollercoaster.


15
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:29,600
No, it's more like skydiving.


16
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,479
There's no turning back.


17
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,910
I didn't plan to start it.


18
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,460
Now I can only fall.


19
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:19,829
I'M STANDING ON A MILLION LIVES


20
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:24,660
The strange routine in front of me


21
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:28,600
Stepping out of common sense


22
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:37,790
Cutting off the comforting link
to look for the true light


23
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:42,579
My back is against the wall,
I can't give in


24
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:47,170
(Be tough, don't cry, keep going)


25
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:50,620
The reality is a matter of life or death


26
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:55,079
The enthusiasm within my heart
(surviving in despair)


27
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:59,410
Entering the spiritual world
(fearless, striving)


28
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:03,750
We were born with loneliness


29
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:08,240
Walk side by side,
and be vulnerable no more


30
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:12,790
Even in the face of life's uncertainty


31
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:16,910
The fire of life will never die


32
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:21,190
With courage in my hand, I stand strong


33
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:28,420
Fight for tomorrow


34
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:39,880
EPISODE 12, A KILLER'S SUMMER


35
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:47,070
Hey, pass the ball!


36
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:50,329
Hey!


37
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,680
Who passed the ball to that guy?


38
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:54,600
Shit.


39
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:00,660
Here.


40
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:01,500
That's impressive.


41
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:04,410
But has that guy always been
so good at sports?


42
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:07,230
Sorry.


43
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:12,730
It's okay.


44
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:18,860
It's a big improvement already
not to be on the sideline.


45
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:22,120
I feel stronger now.


46
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:26,020
It also feels easier for me than before.


47
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:29,010
Is it because of our upgrades
in the other world?


48
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:30,030
Perhaps.


49
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:33,380
Although my disease is not cured yet,


50
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:36,400
running is still unbearable for me here.


51
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:40,130
This should have had happened
before the grand tournament.


52
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:45,810
Does Yotsuya know about the parameters?


53
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:49,240
I've not spoken to him since then.


54
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,750
It's a bit difficult to talk with him.


55
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:02,790
Yuka, Yuka,


56
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:06,040
what happened to Yotsuya?


57
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,650
We haven't told you the details


58
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:12,730
about how we rescued the Altrosians.


59
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:16,450
He


60
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:20,370
killed someone.


61
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,820
-AND?
-AND HE LIT THE FIRE AND BURNED HIM ALIVE.


62
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:28,040
SERIOUSLY?


63
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:31,300
I SAW IT WITH MY OWN EYES.
IT WAS A SHOCK.


64
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,690
Hey, Yotsuya!


65
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:35,940
Just pass the ball!


66
00:05:38,409 --> 00:05:41,170
What the... stop trying to be a hero.


67
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:46,159
I suppose it's hard to deal with that.


68
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,690
Really?


69
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:55,020
Yes, it's true.


70
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:02,780
I'm the one who killed him, after all.


71
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,460
Who are you?


72
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:17,950
Who are you?


73
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:23,860
It's definitely that.


74
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:26,380
Impossible! Knock it off.


75
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:28,330
I said no.


76
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:30,080
I hate this city.


77
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:31,220
You said that?


78
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:32,790
I did! Stop it.


79
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:37,409
NEW TEXT MESSAGE
FROM: GAME MASTER


80
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,560
The game master?


81
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,270
A mission? Why me again?


82
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:50,230
There's no getting out of it now.


83
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:59,520
QUESTION: HOW DOES IT FEEL
TO HAVE KILLED SOMEONE?


84
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:11,530
What the hell?


85
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:18,980
Did he plan for me to kill someone?


86
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:20,990
No, but...


87
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:22,600
That was...


88
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:25,390
That was no mistake.


89
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,270
It was my own judgement.


90
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:36,230
I mistook that place as a virtual world
and firmly believed it to be so.


91
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:38,110
Darn it!


92
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,210
Hello.


93
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:55,550
Who are you?


94
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:56,760
I say,


95
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:59,480
you should reply to my message.


96
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:01,690
Reply to your message?


97
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:03,530
NEW TEXT MESSAGE
FROM: GAME MASTER


98
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:06,490
You... you're the game master?


99
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:08,460
No, are you another one of them
from the future?


100
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:11,700
Which one is it?


101
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:15,430
You have no right to ask questions.


102
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:17,060
You really are the game master.


103
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:20,390
You can actually speak normally?


104
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:26,080
Well...


105
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:32,909
A part of me thinks that
it didn't matter if they died.


106
00:08:35,669 --> 00:08:40,919
They were going to kill innocent believers
as a warning to others.


107
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:46,260
They also lied to us
and wanted to kill us.


108
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,400
To me, those were bad people.


109
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:54,460
The other part of me thinks
it's wrong that they died.


110
00:08:55,500 --> 00:09:00,600
They have their own concept
of justice so...


111
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:01,210
And?


112
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,820
The answer to my question?


113
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:12,390
Having killed a person is my mistake.


114
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:14,840
If I'd known about the parallel world,
I wouldn't have killed him.


115
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:16,890
Yes, that's it.


116
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,080
That's it?


117
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:24,770
That's it. Nothing more.


118
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:27,790
I see.


119
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:31,950
Let's talk about the next player then.


120
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:34,320
Are you serious?


121
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:35,940
Like the previous time,


122
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:38,480
there's someone you need to meet, Yusuke.


123
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:42,370
By the way,
when you told me to hit on Tokitate,


124
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:43,240
what did you mean?


125
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:45,870
You have no right to ask questions.


126
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:49,130
I already told you.
That was literally what I meant.


127
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:50,880
What did you say?


128
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:53,710
Save someone in the toilet
to hit on a girl.


129
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:56,530
Well, I can't remember.


130
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:59,680
So, will you go? Yes, or no?


131
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,350
Sure, I'll do it.


132
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:05,420
Let's go then.


133
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:08,700
A hat? Why?


134
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,410
"PROBABILITY OF THE OCCUPATION ROULETTE"
WARRIOR (SWORD) 20%, WARRIOR (SPEAR) 12.5%


135
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:12,660

MAGICIAN (WIND) 12.5%, (BIOLOGY) 12.5%


136
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:13,580

OTHER FIVE INSIGNIFICANT OCCUPATIONS

138
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:20,990
It's about time.


139
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:22,700
Get ready.


140
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:30,670
The broth inside is very hot,
please be careful.


141
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:36,140
So, what is it about
this Chinese restaurant?


142
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:39,100
That person sitting at the counter.


143
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:44,160
He's been a drug dealer until recently.


144
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:50,920
In 20 seconds, the new player will
come in here and kill him.


145
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:54,620
It's because a man deceived him
saying he won't get caught.


146
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:56,890
In 20 seconds!
Kill... he's going to kill someone?


147
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:58,520
Ten, nine...


148
00:10:58,920 --> 00:10:59,800
Hold on.


149
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:03,530
The player's name is Torii Keita,
19 years old, male.


150
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:07,800
Shuji, his 14-year-old brother
also partakes in this plan.


151
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:09,600
14 years old? That's my age.


152
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:11,430
Three, two...


153
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:16,430
Found you! There he is!


154
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:18,400
Die!


155
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:20,540
But which one is he?


156
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,560
What are you doing?


157
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:32,710
I... I'd advise you not to kill anyone.


158
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:35,870
Although I'm not sure,
you seem to be deceived.


159
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,340
Shut up, asshole!


160
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:40,360
Ouch!


161
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:47,730
I knew it.


162
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:51,820
Idiots who can't get what I'm saying


163
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:53,560
annoy the hell out of me!


164
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:56,110
Darn it!


165
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:59,750
Right, they won't be tricked into
coming here if they aren't dumb.


166
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:04,930
Shuji!


167
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:06,940
You jerk!


168
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,550
Shuji is the brother's name, isn't it?


169
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:11,380
So this is the guy.


170
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:21,350
Your target's escaped?


171
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:24,310
The police will be here soon.
Take your brother and run.


172
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:25,110
Get out of my way!


173
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:26,420
I'm going to kill him!


174
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:28,480
Why did you get in my way?


175
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:31,390
That guy is a drug dealer,
he deserves to die!


176
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,390
Why are you protecting that sort of man?


177
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:36,120
I don't care who is it.
I won't let you kill anyone.


178
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:39,410
What's wrong?


179
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:41,230
What happened?


180
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:42,850
I'm not sure.


181
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:45,510
There's kid here, a middle school kid.


182
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,110
A kid?


183
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,820
Get out of my way!


184
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:50,540
Never!


185
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:01,380
Step aside.


186
00:13:03,770 --> 00:13:06,420
Are you hired by the Kodan-gumi?


187
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,340
No, I'm not.


188
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:12,280
Don't lie, kid.


189
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:17,620
Yusuke?


190
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:29,700
A child?


191
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:34,320
Do you want this?


192
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,140
A glove?


193
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:41,920
Rascal!


194
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:46,330
Bio-magic.


195
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:50,060
"Stop!"


196
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:13,210
Ouch.


197
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:17,020
What's... this?


198
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:20,760
Finally.


199
00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:22,980
The police are here.


200
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:23,880
Hurry up!


201
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:26,180
Take your brother and run!


202
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:28,680
Hey, who exactly...


203
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:36,400
That rascal.


204
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,780
Who do you think has
kept you alive till today?


205
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:41,440
Shut up.


206
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:45,240
You lost to a kid and now,
you want to shoot him from behind.


207
00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:50,380
That makes you a total loser.


208
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:55,660
Keita, hurry!


209
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:05,130
Where did that guy go?


210
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:10,950
I've cleared my quest? I'm going home.


211
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,900
Talk with me.


212
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:18,360
You stopped a murder today.


213
00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:20,220
So?


214
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:25,120
How did you feel when you kill someone?


215
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:28,450
I don't know.


216
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:33,290
But I think I know what to do now.


217
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:38,120
If those brothers were caught, the chance
of completing the next quest decreases.


218
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:44,720
I remember what you said
before I went to rescue Tokitate.


219
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:49,390
The success of this pick-up affects
the success rate of the next quest.


220
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:54,200
Tokitate was the one
who finished the last quest.


221
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:58,390
In other words, the success rate went up


222
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:00,630
because I went to hit on Tokitate, right?


223
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:05,280
Tokitate fought until the end
despite her personality


224
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,870
because there's still a real world
that she wants to return to.


225
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:12,630
A real world where her naked pictures
are not published.


226
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:18,920
Although it was something psychological,
the success rate of the quest did go up.


227
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:22,200
And this time,


228
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,560
I created a world that the new player


229
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:30,950
would want to return to.
A world where they aren't arrested.


230
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:34,990
If so, the success rate of
our next quest will go up.


231
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:35,860
Is that it?


232
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:37,250
Why?


233
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:40,590
What about the value of life?


234
00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:45,430
Value my ass.


235
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:51,450
Idiots who make use of others
to take lives for them should die.


236
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:59,570
The least valuable of humans
should die out first.


237
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,460
And that blonde hair, I would not
care for him at all if he wasn't a player.


238
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:08,740
That's so funny!


239
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:13,910
I heard that a junior in the tennis club
confessed her feelings for Nakada.


240
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:14,849
Another police car?


241
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,440
It's been quite noisy since a while ago.


242
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:18,950
Did something happen?


243
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:20,130
Could it be a murder?


244
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:21,240
That's so scary.


245
00:17:21,589 --> 00:17:24,470
Iu, how scary it is if it was a murder!


246
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:28,730
Murder... I suppose that can be
quite upsetting?


247
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:31,900
Upsetting? What are you talking about?


248
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:34,560
Sorry, did I say something?


249
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:36,180
Are you okay?


250
00:17:38,010 --> 00:17:38,890
I'm home.


251
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,450
Welcome home.


252
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:44,650
I heard that a guy with a gun was arrested
in front of the train station.


253
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:45,870
I see.


254
00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:49,130
Don't you think it's scary?


255
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:50,190
It is.


256
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:56,560
I'll prepare dinner.
You can take a bath first.


257
00:17:57,170 --> 00:17:58,650
Okay.


258
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:07,620
She used to cry out of fear
just by hearing about a theft nearby.


259
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:15,290
I only saved them in order to increase
Shindo and Hakozaki's survival rate,


260
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:16,530
even if it might just be one percent.


261
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:18,700
Hey, did you forget about me?


262
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:20,410
OKAY
I HAVEN'T


263
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,200
KIND OF, VAGUELY
WHO ARE YOU?


264
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:24,770
You haven't been here for a while.


265
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:27,890
Yes, something came up.


266
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:30,740
It made me a bit depressed.


267
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:33,690
But don't worry, I'm okay now.


268
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:37,480
I saw so many police cars
on my way home tonight.


269
00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:39,350
Hey, I was still talking.


270
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,630
What could it be? Sounds so scary.


271
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,000
There isn't any news online yet.


272
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:44,950
I'll go get some drinks.


273
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:48,310
It's unusual,
there's something fishy about it.


274
00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:54,650
So I thought, maybe there's a scary secret
behind it.


275
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:59,220
I rewatched a video from the other day
and found some hints!


276
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:00,700
In other words, I have some sort of radar
in my head.


277
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:03,250
Speaking of which, when will
the next quest come up?


278
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:05,060
This event is definitely the same!


279
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:10,000
The value of human lives?


280
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:17,660
Standing aloof and judging others,
like some anonymous netizen.


281
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:21,560
Who do you think you are?


282
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:28,950
A nobody. I'm just a kid.


283
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:32,210
Just a stupid kid with
an eighth-grade syndrome.


284
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:38,540
And I know that I'm wrong.


285
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,330
I'll admit to that.


286
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:43,340
I actually do know that.


287
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:49,500
But, how should I put it?
It just doesn't seem real.


288
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:55,730
It just feels as if I'm right
and everyone else is wrong.


289
00:19:56,310 --> 00:20:00,780
But I do know it's just a symptom
of the eighth-grade syndrome.


290
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:02,970
However...


291
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:07,350
So what?


292
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:11,810
I want to help everyone.


293
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,630
How can I let you die!


294
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:14,920
Help me out.


295
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:16,780
Thank you for your help!


296
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:21,490
Thank you very much.


297
00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:29,240
Who are you?


298
00:20:32,530 --> 00:20:35,470
I only fight for the justice
that I believe in.


299
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:38,850
That's what I did
and I'll continue to do so.


300
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:51,860
QUESTION: WHERE DOES YOUR JUSTICE LIE IN?


301
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:06,860
In the shiny world


302
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:09,780
Embracing the moment


303
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:12,610
In the shiny world


304
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:15,580
Now, now, now


305
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:18,420
How can I become stronger


306
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:21,330
The reason why I always feel lost


307
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:23,000
Now, now, now


308
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:26,490
Memories sparkle


309
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:30,120
If I could become you or somebody else


310
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:33,040
Flying birds


311
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,630
Now, now, now


312
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:38,150
Must share the same wishes


313
00:21:39,050 --> 00:21:46,250
Even though all the "ifs" come true


314
00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:49,590
I won't be me again


315
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:56,570
Write down your dream and my name


316
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:59,430
On the beach with an hour hand


317
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:01,430
It'll disappear soon


318
00:22:01,650 --> 00:22:08,270
Even so, I want to be me for once


319
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:11,130
Unpredictable future


320
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:14,210
Moving forward with you


321
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:17,140
In the shiny world


322
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:17,750
Embracing the moment

324
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,720
I hate that city.


325
00:22:31,670 --> 00:22:34,670
I hate the people in that city even more.


326
00:22:38,130 --> 00:22:39,520
SEASON TWO CONFIRMED


327
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:41,820
THE STAGE WILL BE


328
00:22:43,390 --> 00:22:44,370
THE UNIVERSE


329
00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:47,290
The universe is way more exciting
than that dratted Tokyo.


330
00:22:49,050 --> 00:22:54,270
From now on, you'll offer your hearts
to the human beings.

MYSTERIOUS BEAUTY, YANA (27)

AOIU (25)


333
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,050
ALTERNATE WORLD DIVISION, NOT VIRTUAL


334
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,910
BETRAYAL


335
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:11,860
My snack is stolen!


336
00:23:12,530 --> 00:23:14,300
EXTREME FACIAL EXPRESSION


337
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:16,620
There might be more than one truth.


338
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:17,980
THE KILLER IS AMONG US


339
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:19,750
AND BRAND NEW EVIL SHADOWS


340
00:23:19,910 --> 00:23:21,440
AMAZING, THE WHOLE WORLD IS CRYING


341
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:22,330
AN OVERWHELMING LOVE STORY


342
00:23:22,390 --> 00:23:23,910
UNPREDICTABLE


343
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:24,860
CONTINUOUS BATTLES


344
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:26,520
I...


345
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:27,540
I...


346
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:28,750
And me.


347
00:23:29,330 --> 00:23:30,050
I...


348
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:36,130
I'm standing on a million lives,
season two.


349
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:37,630
Coming soon.
