1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:05,620
Let's split up.

2
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:07,710
Split up? What do you mean?

3
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:12,830
I think it's better
that we split up into two teams.

4
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:14,330
Two teams?

5
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:18,930
One team goes after the Deock Empire
soldiers to rescue the Altrosians.

6
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:23,040
The other team searches for other cargos
that are Radorpo bound.

7
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:25,160
What exactly is this cargo?

8
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:29,850
Without figuring out its definition,
we won't know how to clear this stage.

9
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:35,490
Indeed, if we misunderstood
the definition, we might fail.

10
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:37,560
Sounds like a good idea.

11
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:42,080
How should we split up?

12
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:43,420
Judging by combat level,

13
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:46,750
Shindo and I
should be on different teams.

14
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:47,580
For certain,

15
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,480
I'm going after the Deock soldiers

16
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:53,100
to avenge Bimzberg.

17
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,240
In this case,

18
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:57,960
it's up to the rest of you
to decide which team you want to be on.

19
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:14,860
I'M STANDING ON A MILLION LIVES

20
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:19,700
The strange routine in front of me

21
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:23,630
Stepping out of common sense

22
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:32,820
Cutting off the comforting link
to look for the true light

23
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:37,620
My back is against the wall,
I can't give in

24
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:42,200
(Be tough, don't cry, keep going)

25
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:45,660
The reality is a matter of life or death

26
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:50,080
The enthusiasm within my heart
(surviving in despair)

27
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:54,450
Entering the spiritual world
(fearless, striving)

28
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:58,780
We were born with loneliness

29
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:03,270
Walk side by side,
and be vulnerable no more

30
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:07,830
Even in the face of life's uncertainty

31
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:11,940
The fire of life will never die

32
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:16,220
With courage in my hand, I stand strong

33
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:23,450
Fight for tomorrow

34
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:30,750
RADORPO, GATEWAY
MARANBA TERRITORY

35
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:33,630
Remaining time, 7 days and 1 hour.

36
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:35,790
TEAM A
SEARCH FOR CARGOS TO DELIVER TO RADORPO

37
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:38,030
TEAM B
GO AFTER THE DEOCK SOLDIERS

38
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:45,790
Keep going down this road,
and there should be a village.

39
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:49,790
We'll look for any cargo that's
going to Radorpo and ask to escort it.

40
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,570
That will clear the quest.

41
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:55,600
In this case,
even if we can't find a village,

42
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:59,050
we might also run into merchants
going to Radorpo.

43
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:02,840
Escorting merchants might also work.

44
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,840
This seems quite easy.

45
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:08,720
Team A seems to be going well.

46
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:13,200
Therefore, as planned,

47
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:15,730
Team B will go after
Deock Empire's carriage.

48
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:20,790
Why am I on this team?
It's definitely going to be dangerous.

49
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:24,110
They don't know that we escaped.

50
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:28,560
It'd be good to catch them off-guard
and kill them.

51
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:29,840
But, there's something bothering me.

52
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:33,860
Before we were trapped in that cave...

53
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,300
There you go.

54
00:03:57,730 --> 00:04:00,330
That should be their routine report
to the kingdom.

55
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:04,600
It was likely they reported back about

56
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:06,480
entrapping the Warriors and
Cortonel soldiers.

57
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:10,710
It's highly possible.

58
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:14,620
If they sent a letter
about imprisoning Cortonel soldiers,

59
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:17,630
but ended up losing contact
with the kingdom,

60
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:20,950
the Deock Empire might think
that their soldiers didn't catch us,

61
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,760
but were killed by us?

62
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:25,020
That's right.

63
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:28,410
No, they're a warmongering country.

64
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,870
They can use any reason to wage a war.

65
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:35,580
We must not let that happen.

66
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:38,260
Are you saying that it might cause a war?

67
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:42,700
In terms of the number of soldiers alone,
the empire is ten times as powerful as us.

68
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:44,420
We stand no chance.

69
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,960
I don't want my country to be destroyed
because of me.

70
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:51,260
Therefore, what we must do

71
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:57,310
is make them write another letter
stating that Cortonel isn't the enemy.

72
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:59,960
"Make them write"? They have to write it?

73
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,050
We don't know their language,
handwriting, and signature

74
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:06,910
so we can't threaten them
or write it for them.

75
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:11,750
We have to gain their trust
so that they send the report on their own.

76
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:14,100
That's way too hard.

77
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:17,210
The letter might not make any difference.

78
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:22,940
The empire can ignore the letter
and wage war upon Cortonel.

79
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,720
However, even so...

80
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:27,370
I want them to go through hell
and despair,

81
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:29,950
suffer from humiliation and despair,

82
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:33,200
and die in agony.

83
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:36,590
I have an idea.

84
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:42,030
A face of a villain.

85
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:49,770
Finally, we've caught up with them.

86
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:54,000
There are the Deock soldiers,
and the prisoners are still safe.

87
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,650
When should we attack?

88
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:56,620
Not yet.

89
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:59,720
This area is all flat
without any obstacles.

90
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:03,510
Before we're fully prepared,
we'll keep following them from a distance.

91
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:11,910
We'll strike tomorrow.

92
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:13,430
Understood.

93
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:18,640
By the way, I can't believe
you'd come up with such a cruel idea.

94
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:23,110
Perhaps you're better off as
a Boss monster than a warrior.

95
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:27,350
It's kind of my specialty.

96
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:29,640
Dark Souls series,

97
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:31,790
Fallout series, et cetera.

98
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:33,710
Oh, console games.

99
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:38,909
So, I spent a lot of my time
thinking about how to kill my enemies.

100
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:42,540
I've been playing social networking games
in the past year.

101
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:43,830
Your smile is more beautiful
than any gems in the world.

102
00:06:43,909 --> 00:06:47,470
I want to see you again soon, Tsubasa!
Tsubasa, I miss you so much!

103
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:51,280
Speaking of this world,

104
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:54,730
this is a virtual world, right?

105
00:06:54,909 --> 00:06:58,330
I have no idea either.

106
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,620
Let's say,

107
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:07,120
if you kissed someone from this world
here,

108
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:10,610
does it count as the first kiss?

109
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,670
What? Did you...

110
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:17,980
Who did you kiss?
Mr. Makua or someone else?

111
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:23,190
I did not! I'm not talking about me!

112
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:27,370
Is it Shindo?

113
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,370
It's a hypothetical question.

114
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:31,450
I'm not talking about anyone specifically.

115
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:35,210
Well, I'm talking about you!
And you're being too direct.

116
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:39,409
Anyway, first kiss is only a concept.

117
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:42,990
A virtual one should also count
as an experience, no?

118
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:46,490
Besides, this world is so extremely real.

119
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:49,630
I'll relieve Ms. Kahabell of her shift.

120
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,350
But whose experience is it
if he was asleep?

121
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,240
I don't think
that can count as experience.

122
00:07:57,290 --> 00:07:59,659
By the way, it's often that one is awake

123
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,250
but misses the timing to open his eyes?

124
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:03,910
Wake up, Ms. Kahabell.
Time to change shifts.

125
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,600
Judging by his reaction,

126
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:08,830
he was completely asleep then.

127
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,040
It has been a difficult journey.

128
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:15,510
All the commanding officers died

129
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:19,540
so I, the lance corporal, have to
take charge for the rest of the journey.

130
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,400
It's something
that has never been heard before.

131
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:25,910
However, this journey will end
in three days.

132
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,240
At Radorpo, the international port,

133
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:32,110
we shall execute the foreign pagans

134
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,120
to take them down a peg.

135
00:08:34,409 --> 00:08:40,030
This will also prevent Mery Continent
from being defiled by them.

136
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:43,010
Excuse me...

137
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:46,960
Can I interrupt for a second?

138
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:48,280
What?

139
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:51,200
You escaped from that dungeon?

140
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:52,830
Get ready for combat!

141
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:57,980
Wait a second,
I'm here to make a deal.

142
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,930
A deal?

143
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:00,760
That's right.

144
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:04,200
You should know that
fighting against us pointless, right?

145
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:08,110
Warriors can recover from any wound
within 20 seconds,

146
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:10,800
and we're revived from death
in 40 seconds.

147
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:14,070
You don't stand a chance.

148
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:18,000
So, what do you want?
What's the deal?

149
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:19,770
Before we discuss that,

150
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:22,840
three Cortonels were killed in that cave.

151
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:24,790
Two warriors also fell into the cave.

152
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:27,080
It's now just me
and the girl with glasses.

153
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:28,530
Hey, Glasses!

154
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:32,030
Shut up, I'm here.

155
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:37,060
You're the one making the deal.
Why should I be here?

156
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:39,240
He's making this deal?

157
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,810
That's right.

158
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:44,840
He's a warrior but
he's become an Altrosian.

159
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:46,030
What?

160
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:47,310
That's right.

161
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:51,630
I'm making a deal with you
in exchange for the three Altrosians.

162
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:53,540
If you don't give them to me,

163
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:57,690
my immortal self will go around the world
to spread the teachings of the Saint.

164
00:09:58,070 --> 00:10:00,670
People will surely believe in the warrior,
won't they?

165
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:01,890
What's more,

166
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:05,270
the world will be full of Altrosians!

167
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:08,700
If we give them to you,
you have nothing to lose!

168
00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:10,370
What deal is this?

169
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:14,290
You have until sunrise tomorrow.

170
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:18,040
If you kill or hurt them before that,
the deal is off.

171
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:21,440
I'll come back here when your time is up.

172
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:24,480
Be sure to make a decision before that.

173
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:29,160
Farewell. Let's go, Glasses.

174
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:30,410
Shut up!

175
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:38,300
What do you say, sir?

176
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:39,620
This is not even a deal.

177
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:42,270
But, we can't just ignore it.

178
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:43,530
I know.

179
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,950
If an immortal warrior
becomes a missionary for the pagans,

180
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:50,910
not only will this expedition end in vain,
but it will only get worse.

181
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:53,310
We have to find a way to get rid of them.

182
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:56,800
But, they are already
short of two warriors.

183
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:58,390
That's right.

184
00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:01,620
Warriors are immortal, but they cannot
escape from holes or prisons.

185
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:05,120
Exactly. Let's go capture them tonight.

186
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:06,450
You're right.

187
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:10,480
Warriors are immortals.

188
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,670
Good evening, this is Glasses.

189
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:15,750
What are you doing here?

190
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:18,490
Shush. He doesn't know that I'm here.

191
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:19,650
What do you want?

192
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:24,260
Surely you are aware
that I don't get along with that guy.

193
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:28,900
Indeed, you don't seem to get along.

194
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:31,040
What's the matter?
Are you betraying him?

195
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,540
Now that we're alone,

196
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:36,410
our relationship is at its worse.

197
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:40,500
If you're willing to capture him for me,
I'll show you where he is.

198
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:43,370
What do you say? Shall we go now?

199
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:45,140
We can't trust you.

200
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:49,490
You might free the prisoners
while we're away from the carriage.

201
00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:54,000
Do you want to come with me
to check where he is?

202
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:57,800
No, going back and forth
is just a waste of time.

203
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:59,710
So, what do we do?

204
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,430
Heim and I will go capture that guy.

205
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:04,250
Gurobi will stay on watch.

206
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,030
Yes, sir.

207
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:08,380
If this woman lied, just capture her.

208
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:09,630
Right?

209
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:12,280
Of course. I'll lead the way.

210
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:14,340
So, it's two against one.

211
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:16,800
They took the bait.

212
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:18,390
Bring me the rope.

213
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:19,220
I'm on it.

214
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:21,560
It's none of my business now.

215
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,370
"ATTACK ON HUMANS": DETERMINED AS
"EXCESSIVE DEFENSE OF HUMANS"

216
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:26,620
(UNLESS THEY'RE UNDER ATTACK FIRST)
EXP DEDUCTED AS PUNISHMENT

217
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:28,000
WHICH MAY CAUSE DOWNGRADING
TO ONE OR NEGATIVE

218
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:30,770
Hey, are we there yet?

219
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:32,410
It's just ahead.

220
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:34,440
One more minute.

221
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:36,860
I see, just one minute.

222
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:42,110
Not yet?

223
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:43,310
Almost there.

224
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:45,870
30 seconds more.

225
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,820
Heim, go check it out.

226
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:55,860
Yes, sir.

227
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:02,600
I've taken them this far,
it should be enough.

228
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:08,680
Sir, there's nothing ahead.

229
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,720
You're indeed lying.

230
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:20,060
When we arrive in Radorpo,
I'll drown you in the sea.

231
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:23,550
What's that?

232
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:28,970
Welcome back.

233
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:31,650
What a shame,

234
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:34,660
your mission ends here.

235
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:39,510
You may return to your country now.

236
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:43,340
The Altrosians!

237
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:45,600
Did you kill them?

238
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:47,600
Even the kid?

239
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:54,320
Feeling confused?

240
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,660
Ms. Kahabell and
her two subordinates died.

241
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:58,910
The other two warriors fell into the cave.

242
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:00,310
All of that is true.

243
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:05,440
However, it's a lie that
Yotsutya converted to Altros religion.

244
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,290
What?

245
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:07,510
We...

246
00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:11,440
We're just here to seek revenge.

247
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:16,620
For our five teammates.

248
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:20,780
As for the last survivor...

249
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:23,330
Stop! Stop!

250
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:25,750
The lives of the missionaries
will come to an end like this.

251
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:33,910
Are they doused in oil?

252
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:35,990
They're going to burn them alive!

253
00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:37,260
While I'm on it,

254
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:40,400
I'll light up your horses.

255
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:48,780
Go get them!

256
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:51,360
No, wait,
we can't leave the warriors here.

257
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:56,380
Burn! "Magical Fire!"

258
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:00,920
Don't you dare run!

259
00:15:02,530 --> 00:15:03,310
MAGICIAN (HEAT), WARDROBE (TOP)

260
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:09,620
Hot!

261
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:11,060
Darn it!

262
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:13,360
Hot!

263
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,620
Our horse!

264
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:24,090
We'll take over the cargos
in the carriage.

265
00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:25,290
Come get us!

266
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:27,860
Go!

267
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:30,280
Are they coming?

268
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:31,610
Yes, here they come.

269
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:34,330
It's a flop if they check the bodies.

270
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:47,970
Sir, there seems to be
some commotion out there.

271
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:49,950
What's going on?

272
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:53,580
Warrior?

273
00:15:53,730 --> 00:15:55,070
Take your clothes off.

274
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:58,580
We're here to save you.

275
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:04,230
Good.

276
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:06,700
As planned,

277
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:09,660
they will believe that Ms. Kahabell
and the soldiers from Cortonel are dead.

278
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:14,490
We, the warriors, came seeking revenge.

279
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:18,580
Cortonel and Deock Empire
should at least remain as they were.

280
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:21,120
Even better is that now Kamilt...

281
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:26,540
I trapped them in the ruins
to keep them from tagging along.

282
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:28,070
And that resulted in this.

283
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:31,830
If so, how can I face the King of Deock?

284
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:37,020
He must have regretted his decision
and he's now in great despair?

285
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:39,890
Although I'm impressed,

286
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:42,460
it's probably best
not to befriend this guy?

287
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:46,220
On the other hand, it's worse
to have someone like him as an enemy.

288
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:55,670
It's been three days
and we haven't seen any carriage.

289
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:59,300
There must be a village along the road.

290
00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:02,330
Once we find a village,
we should be able to find a merchant.

291
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:08,240
Even so, we can't be sure that
there will be cargos going to Radorpo.

292
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:11,750
Remaining time, 4 days and 3 hours.

293
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:16,069
I wonder if everything is going well
for Yotsuya's team.

294
00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:26,280
I found a cave down there.

295
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:31,710
Warriors.

296
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:35,300
The little boy has regained consciousness?

297
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,900
Yes, he just did.

298
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:39,190
Well...

299
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:41,890
Your name is Beriri, right?

300
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,150
Yes.

301
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:47,780
I heard that you saved me.
Thank you very much.

302
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,580
Ms. Warrior.

303
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:59,870
You're welcome.

304
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:09,640
No wait, calm down.

305
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:12,020
I'm not attracted to little boys!

306
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:19,820
However, who knew that
the plan would actually work?

307
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:24,430
We must prepare three dummies.

308
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:28,480
Let's make the dummies with
woven bags and spare clothes.

309
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,940
Won't we be exposed if they see the faces?

310
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:33,430
Cover the heads with bags.

311
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,870
Then, wrap ropes around the necks.

312
00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:38,750
That will seem as if they were hanged.

313
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:43,050
If there's a real corpse among them,

314
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:45,940
the other dummies will look
more believable.

315
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:49,160
I understand the strategy.

316
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:51,480
Well then, let's get started.

317
00:18:56,840 --> 00:19:00,650
But in this case,
we have to really kill a human.

318
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,950
We've never killed any human.

319
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:07,910
I'm more concerned with
how much experience it deducts.

320
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,990
No, that's not the problem.

321
00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:14,690
Do you really think we're just in a game?

322
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,230
If this is a real world,
isn't that a huge problem?

323
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:18,850
Is it not?

324
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:23,780
The AI performance of these NPC
is truly over the top.

325
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,840
But, so are we.

326
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:31,050
See? We can feel the pain,
but only barely.

327
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,320
If the game master is being honest,

328
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:36,740
this might be some kind of
future technology.

329
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:41,770
It's deemed a virtual environment
that's a believable illusion.

330
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:47,160
Besides, being able to retrieve weapons
and armors out of thin air

331
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:50,660
cannot be more surreal.

332
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:55,340
Anyway, I'm not the one doing it.
I don't care if it's real.

333
00:19:56,840 --> 00:20:01,090
Great. We have completed the mission
of rescuing the prisoners.

334
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:04,160
Once Ms. Kahabell completes her mission,

335
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:07,330
we'll be able to prevent the unwanted war.

336
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:08,200
Well,

337
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:12,500
even if this is a virtual world,

338
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:15,670
is it necessary to kill people
to prevent war?

339
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:17,420
Of course it is.

340
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:20,780
In five weeks, we will still be
in the same environment.

341
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:26,110
Besides, how can we say no
to a request from our teammate?

342
00:20:27,050 --> 00:20:28,930
What's wrong? Besides,

343
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:31,270
one of our companions were killed.

344
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:34,080
Isn't it right to kill them as well?

345
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:41,230
No, I'd never imagine
hearing something like this from you.

346
00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:45,990
I'm like this in games.
If a character I like is killed,

347
00:20:46,190 --> 00:20:48,400
I'd kill all the enemies as well.

348
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:50,400
But, if so,

349
00:20:51,090 --> 00:20:54,000
what are the three of us to you, Yotsuya?

350
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:56,110
What are you three to me?

351
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,130
Let's say, if there's a bus...

352
00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:00,250
A bus?

353
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:02,560
The bus is about to fall from a cliff.

354
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:07,440
If any of the passengers move,
everyone might die.

355
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:10,680
We just happen to be
the four passengers on that bus.

356
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,670
What a terrible metaphor!

357
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:14,290
And it's not even a metaphor!

358
00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:18,510
Tokitate, don't you remember
that this game is also about your life?

359
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:29,470
We don't have time to care about
the lives of other characters in the game.

360
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:34,910
YOTSUYA YUSUKE, LEVEL 9 to 7

EPISODE 8, NPC KILLER

362
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:55,060
In the shiny world

363
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:57,980
Embracing the moment

364
00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:00,810
In the shiny world

365
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:03,780
Now, now, now

366
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,620
How can I become stronger

367
00:22:06,810 --> 00:22:09,540
The reason why I always feel lost

368
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:11,160
Now, now, now

369
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:14,690
Memories sparkle

370
00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:18,410
If I could become you or somebody else

371
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:21,250
Flying birds

372
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,830
Now, now, now

373
00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:26,350
Must share the same wishes

374
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:34,540
Even though all the "ifs" come true

375
00:22:34,610 --> 00:22:37,790
I won't be me again

376
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:44,770
Write down your dream and my name

377
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:47,630
On the beach with an hour hand

378
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:49,630
It'll disappear soon

379
00:22:49,850 --> 00:22:56,470
Even so, I want to be me for once

380
00:22:56,670 --> 00:22:59,330
Unpredictable future

381
00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:02,410
Moving forward with you

382
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:05,340
In the shiny world

383
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:05,910
Embracing the moment

00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:17,830
Hello everyone,
I'm the virtual Miko streamer, Yukario.

388
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:19,540
For today...

389
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:22,490
Yes! Here they come! The viewers are here!

390
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:24,200
Great!

391
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:25,910
Awesome! This is the first time
I have more than 1000 viewers.

392
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:29,410
I found a professional who can modify
the number of views.

393
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:31,180
Isn't it...

394
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:31,830
THE ACCOUNT IS FROZEN
DUE TO CONFIRMED VIOLATION ACTS

395
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:34,270
Isn't it a violation to the rules?

396
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,330
Anyway, the quest is completed.

397
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:39,500
