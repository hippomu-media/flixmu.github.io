1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:06,120
Back in kindergarten,
I was known as the bad kid on the block.


2
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:11,330
But, a woman I met changed me.


3
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:15,280
I really liked that older girl.


4
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:18,230
But she...


5
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:22,520
One day, she jumped from
the apartment and killed herself.


6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,920
She was being bullied,
but she couldn't tell anyone.


7
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:33,250
It was all because she was ugly.


8
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,750
Apart from the face, she's a nice girl.


9
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:36,640
It's true.


10
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:39,280
It's great that Iu is such a beauty.


11
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:44,940
When I started primary school,
I ended up getting bullied.


12
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:47,920
She's a kid from the
biker gang, Shindo family.


13
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:51,560
I haven't forgotten
how they bullied me back in school.


14
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:55,190
Do you know how much trouble
your two brothers caused us?


15
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:01,490
Why is the teacher always giving Shindo
a hard time?


16
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:05,790
I made the same mistake,
but you didn't say that to me.


17
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,130
Exactly.


18
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:11,190
Only my friends stood by me.


19
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:14,090
That's why I realized that


20
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:16,920
friends are my strength.


21
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:21,970
The world you're in can only
be changed with your own hands.


22
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:28,430
In order not to end up like her...


23
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,700
But, in the end...


24
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:38,120
If everyone dies in here,
you'll die for real.


25
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,789
Forget about everyone for now,
because you're on your own.


26
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:42,800
Be very careful.


27
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:46,150
Everything was taken from me,
my friends and my strength.


28
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:49,810
It took me so much time and effort.


29
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:53,039
In a split second, everything that
I've worked so hard for might...


30
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:58,160
I... I don't want to die
in such a terrible world.


31
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,750
I must...


32
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:03,200
Therefore, Yotsuya,


33
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:12,060
please help me out
for I have nothing in this world.


34
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,980
Save me.


35
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:19,930
Yes... Sure...


36
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:35,820
I'M STANDING ON A MILLION LIVES


37
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:40,660
The strange routine in front of me


38
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,590
Stepping out of common sense


39
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:53,780
Cutting off the comforting link
to look for the true light


40
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:58,579
My back is against the wall,
I can't give in


41
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:03,160
(Be tough, don't cry, keep going)


42
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:06,620
The reality is a matter of life or death


43
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:11,080
The enthusiasm within my heart
(surviving in despair)


44
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:15,410
Entering the spiritual world
(fearless, striving)


45
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:19,740
We were born with loneliness


46
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:24,230
Walk side by side,
and be vulnerable no more


47
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:28,790
Even in the face of life's uncertainty


48
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:32,900
The fire of life will never die


49
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:37,180
With courage in my hand, I stand strong


50
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:44,410
Fight for tomorrow


51
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:57,840
Well, are you sure it was here?


52
00:03:58,070 --> 00:04:01,350
Yes. This is the village that we saved.


53
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:03,560
I can recognize the buildings.


54
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:06,410
It's completely destroyed.


55
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:09,170
Aren't you the warriors?


56
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,710
I never thought I'd meet you here.


57
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:15,920
Hello.


58
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:17,200
What's going on?


59
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:19,070
People in this world


60
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:21,579
seem to be able to recognize us.


61
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:23,490
And they call us the warriors.


62
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,350
That's so tacky.


63
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:29,730
I've been taking this route
for five years now.


64
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:32,000
This village has been in ruins.


65
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:35,760
Does time here pass differently
from our world?


66
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:41,810
I hope that kid is doing well.


67
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:43,960
Now what?


68
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:47,030
We were counting on gathering information
here in the village.


69
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:52,460
Excuse me, do you know Radorpo?


70
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:54,520
Radorpo.


71
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:57,000
This is where we are.


72
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,940
And this is Radorpo.


73
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:02,130
It's located on the westernmost point
of the country.


74
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:03,870
That's too far away.


75
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:06,230
It will take you 30 days on a horse.


76
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:09,930
By foot, it should take you
three times longer.


77
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:11,850
Three months?


78
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:14,930
There's no way we can clear the stage?


79
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:18,240
Say, as a request of the warriors,


80
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:19,950
can you lend us your horse?


81
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,440
This is an essential tool for my business.


82
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:25,620
Warriors, please understand my plight.


83
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:27,430
You're right.


84
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:33,700
Straight ahead, there's Cortonel.
It's hosting a martial arts competition.


85
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:35,430
Martial arts competition.


86
00:05:35,659 --> 00:05:39,360
The reward for the winner
seems to be three horses.


87
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,980
Winning that competition


88
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:49,120
will be our top priority in this quest.


89
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,180
Great timing.


90
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:53,500
We still have some time.


91
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:57,350
How about upgrading our levels
on the way for the competition?


92
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,460
Will we be okay?


93
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:05,760
Defeating goblins is easy
once you get the hang of it.


94
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:08,620
If some super powerful monsters show up...


95
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:10,130
By then,


96
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:11,060
we'll just run away.


97
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:16,000
Yotsuya, what's wrong?


98
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:18,400
Something's stirred in the bush ahead.


99
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,920
Human size, it's a goblin.


100
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,280
Shall we attack together?


101
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:24,370
No, let it show itself.


102
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,870
It's not human size.


103
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:30,310
They are humans!


104
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,270
Aren't you warriors?


105
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:34,570
Big fishes.


106
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:36,090
Capture them alive!


107
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,680
Bandits?


108
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:44,280
Ouch!


109
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:45,750
I'm the game master!


110
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:50,000
Attack of humans detected.
Downgraded.


111
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,820
YOTSUYA YUSUKE DOWNGRADED
LEVEL NINE TO EIGHT


112
00:06:53,909 --> 00:06:57,220
Hurting humans will be determined
as over-defense.


113
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,820
My experience points were deducted.


114
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:00,550
Run!


115
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:02,130
Fighting against them
won't do us any good.


116
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:04,870
"Wind!"


117
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:10,100
Did we lose them?


118
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:13,070
What?


119
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,590
Where's Iu?


120
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:20,060
It seems that they have taken her.


121
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,520
Iu.


122
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,200
Now what?


123
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:26,160
Should we rescue her?


124
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,260
What do you mean?


125
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:31,800
It's like what I said to Hakozaki.


126
00:07:32,909 --> 00:07:35,220
We're in this together.


127
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,200
Yes, that's why we're going to save her.


128
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,120
That's not what I meant.


129
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:45,310
I'm saying that the lives of others
are not important in a quest.


130
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:50,580
As long as one of us clears the stage,
we'll all return to our world.


131
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:55,409
If we run out of time, there will be
an option to abandon the quest.


132
00:07:55,570 --> 00:07:56,540
You know that, right?


133
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:58,490
Well... yes.


134
00:07:58,670 --> 00:07:59,080
But--


135
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:00,950
Our lives are at stake.


136
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:05,220
Even if it's one percent success rate,
we must pick the more reliable strategy.


137
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:11,300
Well... I overheard you earlier.


138
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:15,770
Didn't Iu ask you to save her?


139
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,990
But, you're not doing so now.


140
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:19,690
Why exactly is that?


141
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:22,970
I will save her. I can save her
by clearing the stage.


142
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:26,130
On my list of valuable lives,


143
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,600
Shindo is in the first place.


144
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:30,600
I've even placed her before myself.


145
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:34,770
In other words, I should be protecting her
even at the risk of my life.


146
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:36,960
Hakozaki is also on my list.


147
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,000
What about me?


148
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:43,890
Therefore, I'm serious about
saying that I will rescue her.


149
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:45,450
Yotsuya...


150
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:51,300
Humans aren't saved
just by keeping them alive.


151
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:54,910
Okay. I'll leave that to you then.


152
00:08:55,210 --> 00:08:58,720
This has nothing to do with me.


153
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,360
Kusue, may I have a word?


154
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:04,640
That guy is unreliable.


155
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:07,190
We're the only two sane ones here.


156
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:11,340
Let's split up then.


157
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,620
I'll go to the martial arts competition.


158
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:15,940
We'll rescue Iu.


159
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:23,750
Once again, I'm on my own,
just like the last time.


160
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:29,690
What's wrong with that guy?


161
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:30,880
Well...


162
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:34,750
You just said that
we're the only sane ones here.


163
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:38,290
Yes. Although Iu is remarkable,


164
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:40,390
she doesn't really open up to others.


165
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,800
Although she works really hard,


166
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:47,090
she's beautiful, smart,
and she's great at sports, right?


167
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:48,630
Yes.


168
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,370
We're fallen behind her
right from the starting line.


169
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:55,970
But, some people only get to
keep attending school because of Iu.


170
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:58,640
For those without the courage
to voice their opinions,


171
00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:01,340
Iu is a reliable person.


172
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,750
Boys will surely do her bidding?


173
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:08,700
Except for that guy.


174
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:10,170
Asshole.


175
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,180
Forget about him.


176
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:16,690
Let's rescue Iu.


177
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:20,320
Okay.


178
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,120
Boss.


179
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:27,330
We've caught two more warriors.


180
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:30,000
Have you? Throw them in the same cell.


181
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,600
They ended up getting caught, too.


182
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:36,420
I'm taking over the quest again.


183
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:48,660
Defeating goblins along the way
really paid off.


184
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,530
Magician (biology).


185
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:56,250
YOTSUYA YUSUKE
MAGICIAN (BIOLOGY) LEVEL 1


186
00:10:56,370 --> 00:10:57,660
Bio magic.


187
00:10:57,850 --> 00:11:02,940
Touching creatures with the palm will
accelerate or decelerate their metabolism.


188
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:07,760
Able to increase and decrease
one's persuasiveness.


189
00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:09,680
What does that mean?


190
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:11,150
By the way,


191
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:13,490
all the parameters dropped.


192
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:21,180
Now, the much-anticipated


193
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:24,250
first battle of the warrior, begins!


194
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:27,950
However, once I win this competition,


195
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:32,190
get the horses,
and save all three of them,


196
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:35,090
I might...


197
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:36,910
Ready? Go!


198
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:38,720
I might become popular!


199
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:40,970
Why isn't he here yet?


200
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:42,620
He's really the worst!


201
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:46,840
Does that mean
that we have to stay here for 35 days?


202
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:48,080
Yotsuya...


203
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:50,170
Please stay safe and sound.


204
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:52,780
The warrior died!


205
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:55,080
"SLIT, THE GREAT SWORD"
MATERIAL: FROKEANJIA STEEL, ELM,


206
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,370
SKIN OF THE MERIAN TROLL


207
00:11:56,450 --> 00:11:57,620
NOTE: KAHABELL'S PARENTS HAD IT CUSTOMIZED
WHEN SHE WAS KNIGHTED


208
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:59,000
WORTH 20 TIMES
THE PRICE OF A REGULAR SWORD


209
00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:01,990
Winner, Knight Kahabell


210
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:08,480
That was crazy.
I was killed in five seconds.


211
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:10,580
The warrior is revived!


212
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:11,500
-A true warrior!
-That's impressive!


213
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:12,870
This is how a warrior is?


214
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,880
I'm so embarrassed.


215
00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:17,520
You're really revived.


216
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:21,160
The rumor is true.


217
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:23,200
Hello.


218
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,130
Moreover, she's a girl.


219
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,700
I was worried about
what I should do if you really died.


220
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:29,860
Is that so?


221
00:12:30,210 --> 00:12:33,580
In a way, I'm already feeling hopeless.


222
00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:35,750
Well...


223
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,660
Will you lend your horse to me?


224
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:43,750
I must get to Radorpo in 35 days.


225
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:45,800
Radorpo.


226
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:48,140
It's said to be
on the westernmost point.


227
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:50,090
The westernmost point?


228
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:54,020
Even the traveling merchants
only go to the next town.


229
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:55,730
For example,


230
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:59,000
can you hire me for some work
so I can afford a few horses?


231
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:00,940
A job that takes just five days.


232
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,210
Well, for a big expedition,


233
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:07,920
you may exchange a troll for a horse.


234
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:11,160
But, I wonder if you could come across one
in five days?


235
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,350
Expedition?


236
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:18,750
What about bandits?


237
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,310
Are you saying
there's a bandits' lair?


238
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:26,220
That area is truly a blind spot.
Thank you, warrior.


239
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:27,130
You're welcome.


240
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:28,960
Well, so...


241
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:31,670
The information isn't worth three horses,


242
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:33,590
but I can give you one.


243
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:37,310
There's finally a flicker of hope.


244
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:41,680
So we'll attack before dawn?


245
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:44,320
There's still half a day left.


246
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:47,010
Do you want to practice swordfight
in the meantime?


247
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:52,050
Frankly speaking, your sword fighting level
is totally amateur.


248
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:53,970
If you don't mind, I can train with you.


249
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:56,440
Indeed, if there's only one horse,


250
00:13:56,670 --> 00:14:00,080
I might end up going to Radorpo alone.


251
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:02,740
Please do.


252
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:06,160
Can't you hold a sword?


253
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:08,360
No. Give me a second.


254
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:15,760
I'll start attacking in five seconds.


255
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:18,000
You may attack all you want before that.


256
00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:30,100
You're improved a lot since the beginning.


257
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:33,700
Your sword fighting is now
mediocre to low.


258
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:37,150
After I became a magician,
my physical ability is normal again.


259
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:40,530
My sense of inferiority is coming back.


260
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:43,320
Where are you throwing the ball, Yotsuya?


261
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:46,510
Yotsuya,
why did you pass the ball to the opponent?


262
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:49,600
The bat is not even aligned with the ball!


263
00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:53,330
I can't do any sports with balls and bats.


264
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:56,450
Human action patterns
are way too complicated.


265
00:14:56,990 --> 00:15:02,070
You're probably not aware
of your movements.


266
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:04,590
The problem is that your posture
isn't accurate enough.


267
00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:08,360
If you swing a bat 1000 times a day,
you should be able to get a hang of it.


268
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:10,430
Understood.


269
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:12,620
1000 times...


270
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:30,990
We'll barge in before dawn.


271
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,300
Eh? He's coming toward here.


272
00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:40,220
So it means that he won the competition.


273
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:42,960
I won't forgive him if he didn't.


274
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,310
Right.


275
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,630
Get here soon!


276
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:50,870
Damn warriors, why are you so cocky?


277
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:52,140
Don't mind them.


278
00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:55,870
Wind magic broke your eardrum
so you should have learned a lesson.


279
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:56,620
Damn it.


280
00:15:56,830 --> 00:16:00,740
We must get a handsome ransom
or I can't put up with this.


281
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:07,650
Patrolling is so boring.


282
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,280
It's finally dawn.


283
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:23,670
Raid!


284
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:27,880
Enemies have struck! The army has invaded!


285
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:32,540
Compared to Ms. Kahabell's sword fighting,


286
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,240
these guys are so much easier!


287
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:37,930
Under the attack,


288
00:16:38,050 --> 00:16:41,440
self-defense doesn't seem to
affect my experience points.


289
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:44,730
Oh no, let that thing out of the cage!


290
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:45,670
Understood.


291
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:50,400
Opening the cage!


292
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:54,250
That thing is coming out.


293
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,590
Run!


294
00:16:58,230 --> 00:17:01,130
Captain Kahabell,
the bandits are running away.


295
00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:03,910
Makua,
send a team of ten to go after them.


296
00:17:04,349 --> 00:17:05,910
Come right back if you can't catch them.


297
00:17:06,069 --> 00:17:06,680
Understood.


298
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,810
What's that cage for?


299
00:17:09,950 --> 00:17:12,710
Is it a beast or a troll?


300
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,829
What's that?


301
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:25,849
It's a Berserker.


302
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:27,310
Berserker?


303
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:30,760
A Berserker has eaten meat with
magic power that humans can't digest.


304
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:33,040
That is, the flesh of monsters.


305
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,480
Therefore, he lost his mind
and became a Berserker.


306
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,980
No way! It can swing a long sword
with one arm?


307
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,000
He's too strong!


308
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:42,820
Get back!


309
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:43,970
Leave him to me!


310
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:48,370
Are you serious?


311
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:49,260
He's good.


312
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:53,320
I'd have to draw out "Rokeyekusa"!


313
00:17:54,610 --> 00:17:56,870
Captain Kahabell drew out the great sword!


314
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:59,150
It's known as Slit, the Great Sword.


315
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:01,440
This is all yours, Captain Kahabell!


316
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:06,050
I love to slit apart


317
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:08,870
the flesh of a living creature!


318
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:14,910
That's why I didn't choose to get married
and start a family as ordinary women do.


319
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:16,640
I chose to become a knight!


320
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,700
This allows me to slit flesh apart!


321
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:24,200
And now, there's a body
that I can slit apart as I wish!


322
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:26,750
I'm so thrilled!


323
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:31,580
I can't wait to slit apart
the body of a Berserker!


324
00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:32,410
Are they equally good?


325
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:34,530
No, strength-wise, he has the upper hand.


326
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,750
Honestly, with such a huge
difference in physicality,


327
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:40,920
it's impressive that they are tied.


328
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:44,620
However, I reckon that
Ms. Kahabell will get tired first.


329
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:55,910
Some fingers are broken.


330
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:58,190
I'll get killed. What can I do?


331
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:01,360
Weapons, skills, bio magic...


332
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:03,970
Persuasiveness...


333
00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:05,540
Increase!


334
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:07,020
Hey!


335
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:11,720
You're going to get killed
by those people behind you.


336
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:15,440
I see.


337
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:23,730
Immediate death!


338
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:31,510
Okay. Search for the remnants!


339
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,000
Oh no.


340
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,040
Is everyone killed?


341
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:36,040
Don't go out!


342
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,980
Stay here, and no one will find us.


343
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:42,060
There are more in here!


344
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:47,520
Well...


345
00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:49,430
Thanks for saving us.


346
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:53,180
I'm sorry! I lost in the first round.


347
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:54,890
You lost?


348
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:57,540
I only got us a horse.


349
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,450
Only one of us gets to ride it?


350
00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:03,200
No, it should be able to fit two
with a carriage.


351
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:06,090
Well then, warriors.


352
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:07,570
Who are you?


353
00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:10,560
I'm Kahabell, a knight.


354
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:12,900
I'd like to give you some advice.


355
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:19,900
This will get it to go forward,
and this, backward.


356
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:24,980
It's an utmost honor for knights
to travel with the warriors.


357
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:27,730
As her father, I'd like to
express my gratitude.


358
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:30,180
You're too kind. I should be
the one to thank you.


359
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,040
My subordinates and I are
taking a long break.


360
00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:36,540
We'll do our best to escort you.


361
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:38,410
Really?


362
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:40,080
I'm only asking for two things in return.


363
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:42,580
First, once we arrive to Radorpo,


364
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,660
we'll reclaim the horses.


365
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:46,490
Sure.


366
00:20:46,810 --> 00:20:47,870
We won't need any by then.


367
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,440
Second,


368
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:55,630
please allow me to coach you four
in sword fighting!


369
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:59,830
I panicked a bit when she got so excited.


370
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:04,800
Swordfighting coach?


371
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,630
I can really use that.
I'm a swordswoman after all.


372
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:11,830
I'm more of a magician.


373
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:14,530
Nice to meet you.


374
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,630
Despite everything that's happened,


375
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:21,150
the outcome is considered good.


376
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:24,580
What did you say to my dad?


377
00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:26,560
Nothing, I just greeted him.


378
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:27,480
I see.


379
00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:29,360
Well then...


380
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:31,610
Let's set out!


381
00:21:35,050 --> 00:21:40,090
EPISODE 4, KAHABELL OF CORTONEL


382
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:55,160
In the shiny world


383
00:21:55,530 --> 00:21:58,080
Embracing the moment


384
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:00,910
In the shiny world


385
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:03,880
Now, now, now


386
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:06,720
How can I become stronger


387
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:09,620
The reason why I always feel lost


388
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:11,290
Now, now, now


389
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:14,790
Memories sparkle


390
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:18,410
If I could become you or somebody else


391
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:21,330
Flying birds


392
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:22,930
Now, now, now


393
00:22:23,130 --> 00:22:26,450
Must share the same wishes


394
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:34,640
Even though all the "ifs" come true


395
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:37,890
I won't be me again


396
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:44,870
Write down your dream and my name


397
00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:47,730
On the beach with an hour hand


398
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,730
It'll disappear soon


399
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:56,570
Even so, I want to be me for once


400
00:22:56,770 --> 00:22:59,430
Unpredictable future


401
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:02,510
Moving forward with you


402
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:05,440
In the shiny world


403
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:06,040
Embracing the moment


404
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:13,700
Hello everyone, I'm Koichi Makoto,
the voice actor for Tokitate Yuka.


405
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:13,870
To boost the number of viewers,
I'll recommend something for discussion.


406
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,790
My recommendation
is someone from a group of eight,


407
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:20,450
the one that radiates maternal love.


408
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:21,280
That is...


409
00:23:21,730 --> 00:23:24,290
Basara Dragon King of the Eight Legions.


410
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:27,940
There's still not enough viewers.


411
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:30,340
The only solution is to get naked.


412
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:34,580
Please subscribe and like the channel.


413
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:35,600
PLEASE SUBSCRIBE AND LIKE


414
00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:37,330
There he is!


415
00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:39,410
Magical fire!
