1
00:00:04,578 --> 00:00:05,898
Alice Rondo.

2
00:00:05,923 --> 00:00:07,133
Here!

3
00:00:07,158 --> 00:00:08,602
Chloe Aubert.

4
00:00:08,656 --> 00:00:09,672
Here!

5
00:00:10,328 --> 00:00:12,359
Good, that's everyone.

6
00:00:12,384 --> 00:00:17,156
As I told you guys before, I'll be leaving
Free Academy by the end of this semester.

7
00:00:17,805 --> 00:00:19,133
Sensei...

8
00:00:20,164 --> 00:00:24,570
Don't be so down. I will come
to visit every once a while.

9
00:00:24,844 --> 00:00:26,789
Hmph, you don't have to.

10
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:29,586
Yeah, we're glad that you
will be gone, in fact.

11
00:00:29,611 --> 00:00:31,336
There's no need to act tough.

12
00:00:31,361 --> 00:00:33,445
You should be more honest.

13
00:00:33,617 --> 00:00:36,844
Promise that you will visit us, okay?

14
00:00:36,869 --> 00:00:38,516
Yes, of course.

15
00:00:38,541 --> 00:00:41,844
That said, there's still over
a month before then.

16
00:00:41,869 --> 00:00:45,516
Moreover, you kids have
final to prepare for.

17
00:00:45,541 --> 00:00:47,414
So you gonna study real hard.

18
00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:49,648
Man, final, huh...

19
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:52,711
Mr.Rimuru, excuse me.

20
00:00:52,953 --> 00:00:55,867
Oh, it's time for Ms.Tiss's class already?

21
00:00:58,531 --> 00:00:59,726
Come in.

22
00:01:00,086 --> 00:01:03,562
You kids better not trouble her okay?

23
00:01:03,587 --> 00:01:05,922
You can bet we won't.

24
00:01:05,947 --> 00:01:11,633
We've bonded with Ms.Tiss during
our journey to Gratol, after all.

25
00:01:12,672 --> 00:01:15,188
Yes, they're all good kids.

26
00:01:15,344 --> 00:01:17,547
Good kids, huh...

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,751
Well then, I'll leave the rest to you.

28
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:25,406
Yes.

29
00:01:25,431 --> 00:01:27,641
So what are you going to do, Mr.Rimuru?

30
00:01:28,219 --> 00:01:30,040
Bet he's going to take a nap
or something.

31
00:01:30,065 --> 00:01:35,087
To let you know, spite how I look,
I'm actually a very busy person.

32
00:01:35,539 --> 00:01:37,273
See you later, my children!

33
00:01:37,562 --> 00:01:40,422
Good bye, Mr.Rimuru.

34
00:01:42,212 --> 00:01:44,329
Well then, time to start the class.

35
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:45,272
Okay!

36
00:01:47,992 --> 00:01:51,180
Seems like they will be fine.

37
00:01:51,205 --> 00:01:52,281
Yes.

38
00:01:52,961 --> 00:01:56,789
I suppose it'll be okay to
leave the rest to Ms.Tiss.

39
00:01:56,991 --> 00:01:58,171
Well then.

40
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:04,875
That's right. I'm busy.

41
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:08,234
Not only for taking care of children
in Free Academy,

42
00:02:08,259 --> 00:02:12,992
I also have a lot of things to do for
the city of us monsters; Tempest.

43
00:02:13,454 --> 00:02:17,164
After analyzing a Sky Element Spirit,
I obtained this skill called Spatial Movement

44
00:02:17,189 --> 00:02:20,595
and it's proven to be very useful
for my needs.

45
00:02:22,883 --> 00:02:27,140
Wonderful, Tempest is as peaceful as ever.

46
00:02:28,008 --> 00:02:32,148
My name is Rimuru Tempest, a slime.

47
00:02:34,484 --> 00:02:37,951
I used to be a human, but I got
stabbed by a passing lunatic.

48
00:02:37,976 --> 00:02:40,021
I thought I was dead for good, but...

49
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:47,989
I got reincarnated to this
world as a slime.

50
00:02:56,919 --> 00:03:00,255
I became friends with
the Storm Dragon Veldora.

51
00:03:09,653 --> 00:03:12,309
I build a country of monsters.

52
00:03:23,942 --> 00:03:26,817
I fought to protect everyone.

53
00:03:35,153 --> 00:03:37,614
Shizu's regret...

54
00:03:48,458 --> 00:03:50,333
Her students...

55
00:03:52,051 --> 00:03:54,637
I was able to save them all.

56
00:03:58,208 --> 00:04:00,497
Now all's fine and dandy.

57
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:12,311
My time as a teacher
is coming to an end, too.

58
00:04:12,336 --> 00:04:16,489
My life here sure is very
eventful up to this point.

59
00:04:16,514 --> 00:04:19,091
A lot of trouble happened, but...

60
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:23,692
Hey Ranga. Let's hope that this
peacefulness stays for a long time.

61
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:53,293
Let's give a name to a nameless flower

62
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:58,298
So that it won't freeze
from the coldness of solitude

63
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:03,053
If it's as frail as it is beautiful

64
00:05:03,053 --> 00:05:05,972
Then it's not as fragile anymore

65
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:12,437
Like how you paint color
on a transparent body

66
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:15,482
Beyond the page of the chapter

67
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:18,193
It's welcoming you with a smile

68
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:22,614
Whenever, as much as it takes

69
00:05:22,614 --> 00:05:25,617
Let's start a new world

70
00:05:25,617 --> 00:05:29,412
We're Storyteller

71
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:33,542
All the love, hope, envy

72
00:05:33,542 --> 00:05:35,460
Even the song of despair we sing today

73
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:39,506
It will all be a seed and bloom,
into a strong person

74
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:45,512
Why does salvation
born from someone's tear

75
00:05:45,512 --> 00:05:50,809
That's just sad

76
00:05:50,809 --> 00:05:57,649
Ideal and fantasy,
all mixed up by youthful impulse

77
00:05:57,649 --> 00:06:04,406
My real self, is now reborn!

78
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:10,370
A lot has happened between me,
and Demon Lord Carrion.

79
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:14,164
As result, we formed a non-aggression pact,
so that neither of us attack each other.

80
00:06:14,205 --> 00:06:17,009
Just now, we received an offer
from Carrion himself.

81
00:06:17,034 --> 00:06:21,142
As such, both Jura Tempest Federation
and Animal Kingdom of Eurazania

82
00:06:21,167 --> 00:06:24,181
will be sending embassy to
each other's country.

83
00:06:24,569 --> 00:06:26,806
I appointed Benimaru as the
leader of the embassy

84
00:06:26,831 --> 00:06:28,666
and Rigur as the secretary.

85
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:33,526
Rigur, I'm so proud of you!

86
00:06:34,022 --> 00:06:38,014
Today is the day of their departure.

87
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:42,616
I return to Tempest to send them off.

88
00:06:48,233 --> 00:06:49,975
Hmm, not bad.

89
00:06:54,795 --> 00:06:58,185
Mn?! This shape is pretty
hard to replicate.

90
00:06:58,256 --> 00:07:00,221
Great Rimuru, sorry for
keeping you waiting.

91
00:07:01,405 --> 00:07:05,271
We brought you some clothes
for the ceremony.

92
00:07:05,335 --> 00:07:08,702
Oh, thanks!
I'll try them on, then.

93
00:07:18,554 --> 00:07:21,726
Isn't this a bit... different?

94
00:07:22,101 --> 00:07:24,671
Then how about this?

95
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:28,827
Well, not quite precise, should I say.

96
00:07:29,546 --> 00:07:31,359
Here's what I got for you.

97
00:07:35,702 --> 00:07:37,187
You look wonderful, Great Rimuru!

98
00:07:37,212 --> 00:07:39,161
It look great on you!

99
00:07:39,186 --> 00:07:41,442
Shuna, Shion, hear me okay...

100
00:07:43,843 --> 00:07:48,296
I would like to wear a more...
fine and proper clothes.

101
00:07:48,321 --> 00:07:50,968
Fine and proper clothes?

102
00:07:51,233 --> 00:07:54,569
It's an important mission for
the future of Tempest.

103
00:07:54,694 --> 00:07:56,999
I want to send them off properly.

104
00:07:57,554 --> 00:07:58,921
I see.

105
00:07:59,326 --> 00:08:02,350
We have one.
A fine and proper clothes, right?

106
00:08:09,575 --> 00:08:11,177
Hey, it's starting.

107
00:08:18,794 --> 00:08:22,020
How breathtaking!
Don't you think so, Gobuzo?

108
00:08:23,036 --> 00:08:24,755
S-So cool!

109
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:26,559
You're cool too, Sir Gabiru!

110
00:08:26,584 --> 00:08:28,403
-Indeed!
-Not bad.

111
00:08:28,428 --> 00:08:30,762
My Master, you're looking dandy!

112
00:08:30,787 --> 00:08:32,887
Everyone, quiet!

113
00:08:43,325 --> 00:08:47,395
My men, I wish you all good luck!

114
00:08:52,528 --> 00:08:54,005
Is that all?

115
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:55,770
Was it too short, as I thought?

116
00:08:57,622 --> 00:08:59,403
Well then, just a bit more.

117
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:05,268
Tempest has grown well compared
to when it first started,

118
00:09:05,293 --> 00:09:08,026
but we still lack the experience
as a country.

119
00:09:08,903 --> 00:09:12,119
If we were able to form a good relation
with Eurazania,

120
00:09:12,144 --> 00:09:14,471
we should be able to
take in their good points

121
00:09:14,471 --> 00:09:17,870
and further develop Tempest
into a much better county.

122
00:09:18,239 --> 00:09:19,481
However!

123
00:09:19,856 --> 00:09:22,518
The leader of Eurazania,
Demon Lord Carrion

124
00:09:22,543 --> 00:09:25,987
is known as the Beastmaster,
a full on fighter.

125
00:09:26,012 --> 00:09:29,380
So he might consider power
rules all, or something.

126
00:09:29,973 --> 00:09:33,091
If it seemed like they're up
for a fight, retreat immediately.

127
00:09:34,255 --> 00:09:36,113
Our objective is not to fight.

128
00:09:36,138 --> 00:09:41,340
It is to confirm whether it's best to
get along or cut our ties with them.

129
00:09:42,044 --> 00:09:46,473
It might all be for Tempest, but there's
no need for you guys to force yourselves, okay?

130
00:09:47,169 --> 00:09:48,309
I'm counting on you.

131
00:09:48,334 --> 00:09:49,145
Yes, sir!

132
00:09:52,342 --> 00:09:56,872
Great Rimuru! I am in awe
of your greatness!

133
00:09:56,897 --> 00:09:57,895
There, there.

134
00:10:01,145 --> 00:10:04,153
I should've been the one to go, usually.

135
00:10:04,178 --> 00:10:05,160
No.

136
00:10:05,185 --> 00:10:09,605
I believe it's best to stay until we can ensure
your safety in a Demon Lord's domain.

137
00:10:10,177 --> 00:10:14,856
I shall now go to discern whether Demon Lord
Carrion is a person deserving our trust.

138
00:10:14,881 --> 00:10:15,950
I'm counting on you.

139
00:10:15,975 --> 00:10:19,231
You better not start a fight, okay?

140
00:10:19,256 --> 00:10:20,778
There's no need to worry.

141
00:10:20,803 --> 00:10:21,840
So reliable!

142
00:10:21,865 --> 00:10:24,403
You sure act like a proper adult now.

143
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:26,653
Rigur, too. Do your best.

144
00:10:26,678 --> 00:10:29,145
Yes! I shall go to improve my insight.

145
00:10:31,497 --> 00:10:33,036
Well then, off we go.

146
00:10:39,387 --> 00:10:41,786
Have fun out there!

147
00:10:41,811 --> 00:10:44,811
-Have a nice trip!
-Do your best!

148
00:10:45,153 --> 00:10:47,919
Be careful, Brother!

149
00:10:48,395 --> 00:10:51,786
A step towards a brighter future, huh.

150
00:10:52,442 --> 00:10:54,699
With the establishment of this
diplomatic relations,

151
00:10:54,724 --> 00:10:58,489
our countries should be able
to grow even more.

152
00:11:00,153 --> 00:11:04,286
Thus, our first embassy departed.

153
00:11:05,216 --> 00:11:11,052
At home, we must also make preparation
to welcome the embassy from Eurazania.

154
00:11:12,918 --> 00:11:16,887
Nice, it looks like the Guest House
will be done in time.

155
00:11:16,912 --> 00:11:18,770
How about the cooks?

156
00:11:18,795 --> 00:11:21,817
Looking good. Princess Shuna
is giving them guidance.

157
00:11:21,842 --> 00:11:24,559
They're all quick learner,
so it goes smoothly.

158
00:11:25,411 --> 00:11:29,216
Let's see, how about we add
a bit more salt?

159
00:11:30,067 --> 00:11:35,043
As for the waiters, Vesta
is giving them the lectures.

160
00:11:35,068 --> 00:11:37,566
He's a master at etiquette, after all.

161
00:11:37,591 --> 00:11:39,504
As expected from a real noble.

162
00:11:39,755 --> 00:11:41,942
Erm, then, after that...

163
00:11:41,967 --> 00:11:45,372
The date of our visit to Armed Nation
of Dwargon has been decided.

164
00:11:45,458 --> 00:11:49,375
Ah, yeah. We should give
King Gazel a proper greeting

165
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:52,545
for the establishment
of our diplomatic relations.

166
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:55,214
It doesn't seem he's convinced by
our explanation regarding Milim

167
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:58,739
when Charybdis attacks,
so we must tell him directly.

168
00:12:02,145 --> 00:12:03,466
Treyni!

169
00:12:04,919 --> 00:12:07,802
Greetings, Great Rimuru.

170
00:12:08,223 --> 00:12:10,856
What is it? Has something happened?

171
00:12:10,881 --> 00:12:14,984
Yes, I'm here to inform you that the embassy
from Animal Kingdom of Eurazania

172
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:17,942
has entered the Great Forest of Jura.

173
00:12:18,075 --> 00:12:19,958
Oh, finally.

174
00:12:20,059 --> 00:12:23,973
I believe they will arrive in
Tempest in two days.

175
00:12:24,091 --> 00:12:26,114
Thank you for telling us.

176
00:12:26,294 --> 00:12:28,473
My pleasure.

177
00:12:28,669 --> 00:12:32,841
Also, seems like they will arrive
here before the embassy.

178
00:12:32,866 --> 00:12:34,286
They?

179
00:12:34,591 --> 00:12:36,802
Yes, the Champion.

180
00:12:42,239 --> 00:12:45,091
We should go home now,
it's getting late.

181
00:12:45,116 --> 00:12:46,387
Okay!

182
00:12:52,689 --> 00:12:53,898
So cute!

183
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:02,052
Don't move!

184
00:13:08,786 --> 00:13:10,848
Youm and his friends.

185
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:13,371
They used to be just a group of ruffians,

186
00:13:13,396 --> 00:13:16,012
but he agreed to take the credit
for defeating the Orc Lord

187
00:13:16,037 --> 00:13:17,911
and be a Champion for us.

188
00:13:18,996 --> 00:13:20,121
Amazing!

189
00:13:20,146 --> 00:13:25,168
Human might be wary of us if they
learn that we defeated the Orc Lord.

190
00:13:25,528 --> 00:13:26,739
Are you hurt?

191
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:29,247
Ah, I'm fine. Thank you very much.

192
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:32,825
Erm... thank you!

193
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:35,966
You better be careful, there are
a lot of evil monsters out here.

194
00:13:36,114 --> 00:13:38,177
Your sword looks cool!

195
00:13:38,202 --> 00:13:39,458
Isn't it?

196
00:13:40,473 --> 00:13:45,075
There's a country of good monsters called
Tempest nearby, I got this sword made there.

197
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:50,669
He travel around the places to spread
that we're a friendly group of monsters.

198
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:02,200
And, after that...

199
00:14:21,012 --> 00:14:24,395
I spend my busy days.

200
00:14:36,942 --> 00:14:40,989
And finally, the day of Eurazania embassy
arrival is coming close.

201
00:14:45,505 --> 00:14:47,419
This sure is good.

202
00:14:47,575 --> 00:14:50,575
It sure is. Haven't had one
this good up until now.

203
00:14:51,645 --> 00:14:54,481
Don't you think so? It's called Brandy.

204
00:14:54,506 --> 00:14:56,434
Brandy?

205
00:14:56,669 --> 00:14:59,989
We will be having visitor, after all.
So I had my men made them.

206
00:15:00,028 --> 00:15:02,098
I see... visitor...

207
00:15:02,123 --> 00:15:06,177
Yeah, Demon Lord Carrion's embassy
will arrive here tomorrow.

208
00:15:07,887 --> 00:15:09,700
Was that on purpose?!

209
00:15:11,317 --> 00:15:14,567
Demon Lord Carrion?!
How did it come to that?!

210
00:15:16,637 --> 00:15:18,786
Well, it's a long story.

211
00:15:19,622 --> 00:15:22,755
Aaah, it feels good.

212
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:29,270
I see.

213
00:15:29,295 --> 00:15:31,622
It's a chance for a diplomatic relations!

214
00:15:32,231 --> 00:15:33,590
Understood.

215
00:15:33,615 --> 00:15:36,059
But still, a Demon Lord, huh...

216
00:15:36,084 --> 00:15:38,596
Bet their embassy is full
of dangerous people.

217
00:15:38,794 --> 00:15:42,395
I wonder. It's not like we're
going to fight or anything.

218
00:15:42,505 --> 00:15:46,598
But you send Benimaru in case
something goes wrong, right?

219
00:15:46,755 --> 00:15:49,723
Won't they think the same thing?

220
00:15:50,184 --> 00:15:52,036
Even so, it doesn't matter.

221
00:15:52,061 --> 00:15:55,029
I don't want to do anything wild
and ruin this chance.

222
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:56,684
Well, that's true.

223
00:15:58,059 --> 00:16:01,168
You better not pick a fight
with their ambassador, okay?

224
00:16:01,193 --> 00:16:06,059
C'mon, Mister. Me and my underling
are not that stupid.

225
00:16:06,084 --> 00:16:06,958
Right?

226
00:16:06,983 --> 00:16:08,302
Indeed.

227
00:16:09,528 --> 00:16:11,153
That's great.

228
00:16:11,178 --> 00:16:13,747
Ah, right, Hakurou wanted to see you.

229
00:16:13,772 --> 00:16:15,371
M-Master said that?!

230
00:16:15,396 --> 00:16:17,887
He said he wanted to check
if your skill is rusting or not.

231
00:16:19,012 --> 00:16:21,575
I'm sober now.

232
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:27,445
And then, a day passed.

233
00:16:37,755 --> 00:16:39,177
They're here.

234
00:16:49,294 --> 00:16:50,919
Is that a horsecar?

235
00:16:50,944 --> 00:16:53,919
But they're carried by tigers,
so a tigercar?

236
00:16:53,944 --> 00:16:55,521
It's like a tank.

237
00:16:55,546 --> 00:16:57,341
It's no big deal.

238
00:16:57,366 --> 00:17:01,341
Those carts won't even worth a dime
in front of Great Rimuru's greatness.

239
00:17:01,366 --> 00:17:04,755
No, no, no, Miss Shion.
That's no small deal, okay?

240
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:08,505
All those fancy accessories means
nothing in combat, after all.

241
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:12,356
No, no, no, Miss Shion.
Combat has nothing to do with this.

242
00:17:24,487 --> 00:17:26,252
Nice to meet you.

243
00:17:26,596 --> 00:17:30,474
Ruler of Jura Tempest Federation,
Lord Rimuru Tempest.

244
00:17:32,737 --> 00:17:35,299
I'm the "Golden Serpent" Albis.

245
00:17:35,823 --> 00:17:38,799
One of Demon Lord Carrion's
Three Beastketeers.

246
00:17:40,963 --> 00:17:43,565
A top executive, that's unexpected.

247
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:44,667
You got to be kidding me!

248
00:17:46,056 --> 00:17:50,221
I came all the way here to see what kind
of monster the ruler of Tempest is.

249
00:17:50,246 --> 00:17:52,655
But isn't that the weakest
monster of all, a slime?

250
00:17:52,655 --> 00:17:55,682
There's a limit on how much
joke we can take, you know?

251
00:17:56,502 --> 00:17:59,033
Oh, this girl looks pretty tough, too.

252
00:17:59,058 --> 00:18:00,588
Back down, Suphia.

253
00:18:01,151 --> 00:18:05,667
Your conduct will directly reflect
on Great Carrion's reputation.

254
00:18:05,799 --> 00:18:09,159
Shut up, Albis, don't you dare
ordering me around.

255
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:13,182
To begin with, setting Dwarf aside,
they're working with human.

256
00:18:13,479 --> 00:18:19,221
To work with those coward little pests
is an insult towards monsters!

257
00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:23,104
You sure like to talk big, huh.

258
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:28,385
Youm over here is my friend and
also a fellow pupil of the same Master.

259
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:29,792
So what?

260
00:18:31,792 --> 00:18:35,674
Hey Youm, you don't feel good
being insulted like this, right?

261
00:18:36,338 --> 00:18:40,042
You got my permission.
Go show her what you got.

262
00:18:40,067 --> 00:18:43,518
Hey Mister! Aren't we supposed
to do this peacefully?

263
00:18:43,698 --> 00:18:49,190
I have no plan to fight, but
if they ask for it, it's different story.

264
00:18:49,596 --> 00:18:52,463
Ooh? Wanna have it with me, human?

265
00:18:54,651 --> 00:18:55,931
Well, I...

266
00:18:55,956 --> 00:18:58,188
Go beat her, Boss!

267
00:18:58,213 --> 00:19:00,696
Will you just let her talk down on us?

268
00:19:00,721 --> 00:19:02,946
Please, Youm!

269
00:19:05,026 --> 00:19:06,877
It can't be helped, then.

270
00:19:10,268 --> 00:19:13,182
Mister, you better pick up
her bones after this.

271
00:19:13,207 --> 00:19:17,416
Hmph, a slime picking up bones?
Cut the jest.

272
00:19:17,441 --> 00:19:20,042
Yeah, leave it to... me?!

273
00:19:20,393 --> 00:19:22,698
Eh, wait, Shion?!

274
00:19:22,823 --> 00:19:27,909
I was putting up with all your
insults towards Great Rimuru so far,

275
00:19:27,934 --> 00:19:33,245
but now that there's no reason
to hold back, I've had it with you!

276
00:19:36,463 --> 00:19:38,237
Wha-, miss?

277
00:19:38,262 --> 00:19:40,307
Your opponent will be me!

278
00:19:42,604 --> 00:19:44,932
You're going empty handed?

279
00:19:45,338 --> 00:19:46,698
Interesting!

280
00:20:15,807 --> 00:20:18,432
Will she be okay?

281
00:20:18,457 --> 00:20:21,987
She's not using her sword, and her
opponent seems to have the upperhand.

282
00:20:22,112 --> 00:20:24,510
She will be fine, Great Rimuru.

283
00:20:24,535 --> 00:20:27,267
Shion is the second strongest
person among us after my brother.

284
00:20:27,494 --> 00:20:29,118
I... see...

285
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:33,588
She really lack the restrain.

286
00:20:34,127 --> 00:20:35,192
Grucius.

287
00:20:35,596 --> 00:20:37,760
You go take on that human.

288
00:20:38,095 --> 00:20:39,155
Really?

289
00:20:39,401 --> 00:20:42,526
It's true that I'm the bottom of
the rank in the brigade.

290
00:20:42,551 --> 00:20:44,682
but you're asking me to
fight a mere human?

291
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,245
I'll play with you.

292
00:20:52,267 --> 00:20:53,455
Human.

293
00:20:53,994 --> 00:20:56,463
Yeah, nice to play...

294
00:20:56,488 --> 00:20:57,565
with you!

295
00:21:08,299 --> 00:21:10,549
Youm is doing pretty good.

296
00:21:10,574 --> 00:21:14,112
He's fighting on equal footing
against that Majin Grucius.

297
00:21:14,354 --> 00:21:16,534
Yes, he put on pretty good fight.

298
00:21:17,213 --> 00:21:20,471
No wonder he passed
Hakurou's training.

299
00:21:20,659 --> 00:21:24,315
Doing great, Boss!
That's a Champion for ya!

300
00:21:28,917 --> 00:21:31,534
To think you would entertain me this much.

301
00:21:32,284 --> 00:21:33,870
Don't you make fun of me, Beastman.

302
00:21:34,229 --> 00:21:38,135
The power of Kijin could
tear the heavens and crush the earth!

303
00:21:40,672 --> 00:21:42,750
Let me show you that!

304
00:21:44,221 --> 00:21:45,713
Great, show me.

305
00:21:45,738 --> 00:21:48,331
Entertain me more!

306
00:21:51,963 --> 00:21:56,416
With this, immidiately after
the embassy from Eurazania arrived,

307
00:21:56,441 --> 00:21:59,221
a fierce fight takes place.

308
00:22:02,041 --> 00:22:04,672
Well, I'm the one who started it, though!

309
00:22:14,124 --> 00:22:17,503
I'm used to losing things

310
00:22:17,503 --> 00:22:22,174
I said it like it's someone else's problem

311
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:26,053
It's a blurry realism

312
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:31,100
Because it's not about me

313
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:36,188
The nameless sadness disappears,
warped in a legato-like dream

314
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:40,359
Will we feel better if we hug each other?

315
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:44,613
The life which I repeat is a joined miracle

316
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:49,159
Don't forget me, pass your voice to me

317
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:56,792
If I were to live for someone's sake

318
00:22:56,792 --> 00:23:01,088
I wish that someone is you
