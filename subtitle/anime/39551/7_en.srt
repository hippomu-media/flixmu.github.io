1
00:00:02,203 --> 00:00:03,375
Die!

2
00:00:03,625 --> 00:00:05,539
Dead End Rainbow!

3
00:00:06,086 --> 00:00:08,453
Awaken, Gluttony!

4
00:00:08,884 --> 00:00:11,637
Understood. Order accepted.

5
00:00:11,637 --> 00:00:13,514
Executing at once.

6
00:00:31,288 --> 00:00:36,251
Let's give a name to a nameless flower

7
00:00:36,251 --> 00:00:41,256
So that it won't freeze
from the coldness of solitude

8
00:00:41,256 --> 00:00:46,011
If it's as frail as it is beautiful

9
00:00:46,011 --> 00:00:48,930
Then it's not as fragile anymore

10
00:00:50,515 --> 00:00:55,395
Like how you paint color
on a transparent body

11
00:00:55,395 --> 00:00:58,440
Beyond the page of the chapter

12
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:01,151
It's welcoming you with a smile

13
00:01:02,694 --> 00:01:05,572
Whenever, as much as it takes

14
00:01:05,572 --> 00:01:08,575
Let's start a new world

15
00:01:08,575 --> 00:01:12,370
We're Storyteller

16
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:16,500
All the love, hope, envy

17
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,418
Even the song of despair we sing today

18
00:01:18,418 --> 00:01:22,464
It will all be a seed and bloom,
into a strong person

19
00:01:22,464 --> 00:01:28,470
Why does salvation
born from someone's tear

20
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:33,767
That's just sad

21
00:01:33,767 --> 00:01:40,607
Ideal and fantasy,
all mixed up by youthful impulse

22
00:01:40,607 --> 00:01:47,364
My real self, is now reborn!

23
00:01:50,296 --> 00:01:53,989
(Episode 31: Despair)

24
00:01:53,989 --> 00:01:55,625
Unbelievable.

25
00:02:01,633 --> 00:02:02,734
I see.

26
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:05,857
You copy the characteristic of
monsters and items you devoured

27
00:02:05,882 --> 00:02:08,063
to create a form
that is specialized in combat.

28
00:02:09,961 --> 00:02:11,250
Which is that.

29
00:02:23,031 --> 00:02:27,689
And seeing that you didn't die
from Dead End Rainbow...

30
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:29,691
...it means you don't have a soul at all.

31
00:02:31,195 --> 00:02:32,313
If so...

32
00:02:34,484 --> 00:02:35,914
Astral Bind!

33
00:02:55,625 --> 00:02:57,828
You won't stop with just that?

34
00:02:59,578 --> 00:03:01,109
Elemental Summon!

35
00:03:10,758 --> 00:03:13,507
Here I give my prayer to the One.

36
00:03:13,532 --> 00:03:17,093
For I seek the power of the holy spirits.

37
00:03:23,891 --> 00:03:26,969
Listen to my wish!

38
00:03:34,687 --> 00:03:36,617
Exhaust everything!

39
00:03:36,642 --> 00:03:38,625
Disintegration!

40
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:13,180
I have avenged you, Ms. Shizu.

41
00:04:32,727 --> 00:04:34,758
I thought I'm dead.

42
00:04:39,593 --> 00:04:41,094
I finally can get out!

43
00:04:41,119 --> 00:04:43,165
Are you okay, My Lord?

44
00:04:44,078 --> 00:04:45,181
My Lord!

45
00:04:45,206 --> 00:04:47,509
I'm fine! I'm fine, okay!

46
00:04:49,578 --> 00:04:52,719
That was really a close call, I must say.

47
00:04:57,422 --> 00:04:59,859
This is not good. She's strong!

48
00:05:00,813 --> 00:05:02,195
The end.

49
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:05,578
You did pretty well moving that
much in this barrier.

50
00:05:05,931 --> 00:05:08,016
To tell you the truth,
I underestimated you.

51
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:11,023
But you can't win against me.

52
00:05:11,056 --> 00:05:13,650
Because you will kill me in
one more hit?

53
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:18,320
Not even I thought the situation
would be this desperate.

54
00:05:18,914 --> 00:05:21,844
But I will keep on struggling
until the end.

55
00:05:21,869 --> 00:05:25,836
I'm not kind enough to let myself
get killed by you so easily!

56
00:05:26,153 --> 00:05:29,193
Report. Using the unique skill De-generate,

57
00:05:29,218 --> 00:05:33,317
the higher-level elemental Ifrit
has been separated into a pure elemental.

58
00:05:33,342 --> 00:05:34,411
Okay.

59
00:05:34,436 --> 00:05:35,889
Defeat my enemy!

60
00:05:36,389 --> 00:05:38,748
O' Ifrit, the high-level fire elemental!

61
00:05:52,068 --> 00:05:56,037
I immediately made a body double
and went into hiding.

62
00:05:57,169 --> 00:05:59,419
It was the right choice to hide.

63
00:05:59,444 --> 00:06:02,653
But still, that darn Hinata.
She's crazy strong.

64
00:06:03,864 --> 00:06:06,294
I would've lost even without that barrier.

65
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:09,317
With that Disintegration thing.

66
00:06:17,002 --> 00:06:19,942
Maybe I can dodge that,
but the chance would be very slim.

67
00:06:19,967 --> 00:06:22,036
I wonder can Milim withstand that.

68
00:06:22,061 --> 00:06:23,434
I should ask her later.

69
00:06:23,708 --> 00:06:25,937
But still, that girl Hinata.
How dare she!

70
00:06:25,962 --> 00:06:29,567
She didn't listen to anything I say
and attacked me ruthlessly like that!

71
00:06:29,592 --> 00:06:33,607
I don't really understand, but it should not
be an exaggeration to say that it's your win.

72
00:06:33,632 --> 00:06:35,568
Right? You think so too, Ranga?

73
00:06:35,593 --> 00:06:39,895
Well, if she insists,
I won't mind calling it a draw.

74
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:44,239
I don't really understand, but it should not
be an exaggeration to say that it's your big win.

75
00:06:46,091 --> 00:06:47,630
Anyway, let's go home now.

76
00:06:47,655 --> 00:06:49,466
I'm worried about everyone.

77
00:06:50,833 --> 00:06:51,817
Back to Tempest!

78
00:06:51,842 --> 00:06:52,669
Yes, sir!

79
00:06:57,895 --> 00:06:59,028
What's wrong?

80
00:06:59,053 --> 00:07:01,614
Report. Unable to locate target location.

81
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:02,302
Huh?

82
00:07:02,327 --> 00:07:07,552
It is believed that Tempest is isolated
by some kind of barrier.

83
00:07:07,577 --> 00:07:09,481
I have a bad feeling about this.

84
00:07:09,506 --> 00:07:12,956
Can we teleport somewhere near Tempest?

85
00:07:12,981 --> 00:07:14,144
Searching.

86
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:15,604
Location found.

87
00:07:15,629 --> 00:07:17,214
Great, let's go!

88
00:07:19,987 --> 00:07:22,550
I will go and break it with my attack.

89
00:07:22,575 --> 00:07:24,612
No, I will go there once again.

90
00:07:24,637 --> 00:07:26,284
But still...

91
00:07:27,995 --> 00:07:29,737
Oooh! Great Rimuru!

92
00:07:32,542 --> 00:07:33,605
Great Rimuru.

93
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:35,120
Glad to see you safe and sound.

94
00:07:35,145 --> 00:07:36,003
Yeah...

95
00:07:36,028 --> 00:07:37,019
Wait!

96
00:07:37,044 --> 00:07:39,731
You're looking much worse than me, Soei!

97
00:07:40,019 --> 00:07:42,191
This means nothing.

98
00:07:45,769 --> 00:07:47,355
Ah, Great Rimuru.

99
00:07:49,167 --> 00:07:50,495
Here, take this.

100
00:07:52,894 --> 00:07:54,980
What is happening in Tempest?

101
00:07:55,042 --> 00:07:57,284
We're not really sure.

102
00:07:57,519 --> 00:08:01,378
I'm worried about my underling
back in town. I can't contact them.

103
00:08:05,402 --> 00:08:07,644
The town seems to be covered
by a barrier.

104
00:08:07,669 --> 00:08:09,049
As I thought.

105
00:08:09,402 --> 00:08:15,685
Sir Soei was injured in his attempt to
cross the barrier that's covering the town.

106
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:16,984
Silence, Soka.

107
00:08:17,009 --> 00:08:18,398
I am fine.

108
00:08:18,423 --> 00:08:19,323
Understood.

109
00:08:20,027 --> 00:08:24,042
If even Soei can't break it,
then it must be really strong.

110
00:08:24,355 --> 00:08:25,722
Who did this?

111
00:08:25,747 --> 00:08:29,800
I fear it might be an attack from
the human nation, Falmuth kingdom.

112
00:08:32,558 --> 00:08:36,222
We have confirmed that there
are some movement in their army.

113
00:08:36,409 --> 00:08:38,659
A large crowd is heading towards Tempest.

114
00:08:39,862 --> 00:08:41,620
Let's head to the town now!

115
00:08:46,995 --> 00:08:50,214
So this is the barrier?!

116
00:08:53,612 --> 00:08:55,527
Great Sage, analyze it.

117
00:08:58,081 --> 00:08:59,058
Report.

118
00:08:59,083 --> 00:09:03,460
The effect of certain Great Magic
from inside, the Anti-Magic Area,

119
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:07,505
and the Barrier from outside have
caused a reduction in magicule density.

120
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:09,323
Reduction in magicule density?

121
00:09:09,348 --> 00:09:11,737
Is it the same thing
as Hinata's Holy Field?

122
00:09:11,762 --> 00:09:12,722
No.

123
00:09:12,747 --> 00:09:15,700
It runs on the same principle,
but has weaker purification effect.

124
00:09:15,725 --> 00:09:17,145
Assumed to be an inferior version.

125
00:09:17,558 --> 00:09:19,934
The effects can be resisted
with Multilayer Barrier.

126
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:23,521
A Great Magic from inside and
Holy Magic from outside.

127
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:25,398
A double barrier, huh.

128
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:27,761
Just who did this and for what purpose?

129
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:31,948
Soei, I will hold down the one
who cast the Great Magic.

130
00:09:31,973 --> 00:09:34,741
You guy look for those who
cast this barrier.

131
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:36,011
- Understood
- Yes, sir.

132
00:09:36,518 --> 00:09:38,838
However, I forbid you from
engaging them in combat.

133
00:09:38,863 --> 00:09:41,277
Confirm their identity and strength.

134
00:09:41,302 --> 00:09:43,507
So how would we contact you?

135
00:09:48,712 --> 00:09:52,884
I'm sure we can do Thought Communication
with this even through the barrier.

136
00:09:52,884 --> 00:09:53,774
I see.

137
00:09:55,399 --> 00:09:56,517
Okay, go!

138
00:09:56,542 --> 00:09:57,509
Yes, sir!

139
00:09:57,712 --> 00:09:59,282
Ranga, get into my shadow.

140
00:09:59,415 --> 00:10:00,126
Yes, sir!

141
00:10:00,903 --> 00:10:02,477
You wait here, Gabiru.

142
00:10:02,502 --> 00:10:03,477
Be careful!

143
00:10:03,502 --> 00:10:04,345
Yeah.

144
00:10:21,165 --> 00:10:23,884
It's weak, but there are
some magicule left.

145
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:32,860
How awful...

146
00:10:39,673 --> 00:10:42,727
All the kids were safe thanks to you.

147
00:10:42,752 --> 00:10:45,345
Thank you so much for protecting them.

148
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:46,806
Thank you so much!

149
00:10:47,024 --> 00:10:48,454
No need for thanks.

150
00:10:48,479 --> 00:10:51,063
I'm sure Sir Gabiru would've
done the same.

151
00:10:51,227 --> 00:10:53,782
We're just doing what's normal.

152
00:10:53,876 --> 00:10:55,805
I hope Sir Gabiru is safe.

153
00:10:59,946 --> 00:11:01,392
It's Great Rimuru!

154
00:11:01,417 --> 00:11:03,556
Great Rimuru, you came.

155
00:11:05,196 --> 00:11:08,306
Great Rimuru!

156
00:11:09,524 --> 00:11:13,017
It's wonderful to see you back.
I'm so glad you're safe.

157
00:11:13,042 --> 00:11:14,282
I'm sorry I'm late.

158
00:11:14,307 --> 00:11:16,126
Not at all!

159
00:11:16,151 --> 00:11:17,509
What happened?

160
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:18,923
About that...

161
00:11:18,948 --> 00:11:21,196
Mister, glad you're safe.

162
00:11:21,735 --> 00:11:22,892
Kaijin...

163
00:11:27,427 --> 00:11:30,555
Great Rimuru, we have a lot of things
to report and discuss with you,

164
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:32,867
so please head to the meeting room.

165
00:11:34,857 --> 00:11:36,279
Kaijin, what's that over there?

166
00:11:36,304 --> 00:11:37,472
Well, it is...

167
00:11:37,497 --> 00:11:40,928
We just got a little trouble, that's all!

168
00:11:40,953 --> 00:11:42,162
Stop changing the topic.

169
00:11:42,187 --> 00:11:43,482
What's happening in the plaza?

170
00:11:56,537 --> 00:11:57,747
What was that?

171
00:11:57,990 --> 00:11:59,154
Is it Benimaru?

172
00:12:26,355 --> 00:12:28,915
You're going to protect that woman, too?

173
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:31,394
I'm sorry but I have no time for this.

174
00:12:31,419 --> 00:12:33,277
Get out of here at once!

175
00:12:33,894 --> 00:12:39,441
No way I'd hand her to you
when you lose your calm like that.

176
00:12:39,466 --> 00:12:40,542
What?

177
00:12:40,567 --> 00:12:42,512
I'm not 'calm' you say?

178
00:12:43,612 --> 00:12:47,909
If I'm not calm, I would've
already burnt you into ashes.

179
00:12:47,948 --> 00:12:49,089
Just give up and--

180
00:12:49,114 --> 00:12:53,300
Sorry, but I will protect
this woman no matter what!

181
00:12:53,325 --> 00:12:55,636
I told you to get down!

182
00:13:02,882 --> 00:13:05,874
But... I'm... still...!

183
00:13:07,406 --> 00:13:09,945
If you continue to resist, I will really...!

184
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:11,515
Stop it, Benimaru!

185
00:13:13,914 --> 00:13:15,093
Great Rimuru.

186
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:19,367
Explain this to me.

187
00:13:20,671 --> 00:13:22,328
It's about this barrier.

188
00:13:22,353 --> 00:13:26,398
It prevents us from using our magic
and lowers our strength.

189
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:29,406
And because of that,
many of our people--

190
00:13:29,431 --> 00:13:31,539
B-Benimaru!

191
00:13:34,539 --> 00:13:36,296
Let's discuss that later.

192
00:13:38,398 --> 00:13:43,679
Regardless, the magic that weakened us
were cast by that woman.

193
00:13:46,109 --> 00:13:48,882
We wanted to capture the caster, but...

194
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:53,304
Youm got in our way, so we were
forced to engage in combat.

195
00:13:55,734 --> 00:13:57,265
Mister Rimuru!

196
00:13:57,290 --> 00:13:58,210
I'm sorry!

197
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:02,679
I have no intention to betray you.

198
00:14:02,851 --> 00:14:06,179
I just wanted to save Mjurran.

199
00:14:06,484 --> 00:14:07,640
Mjurran?

200
00:14:08,046 --> 00:14:09,432
That's enough.

201
00:14:09,432 --> 00:14:11,015
You should abandon me.

202
00:14:11,304 --> 00:14:13,765
Don't say that.

203
00:14:14,203 --> 00:14:17,031
You don't have to get yourself
involved in this.

204
00:14:17,156 --> 00:14:18,804
I told you to not say that!

205
00:14:20,117 --> 00:14:21,968
Lord... Rimuru...

206
00:14:22,781 --> 00:14:26,406
I'm fully aware that it's not the place
for a guest like me to speak...

207
00:14:27,742 --> 00:14:32,179
But even so,
can you at least hear her out?

208
00:14:32,859 --> 00:14:34,082
Okay.

209
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:39,351
No. Youm, Grucius.

210
00:14:39,531 --> 00:14:42,218
I have no right to be protected by you two.

211
00:14:42,243 --> 00:14:43,609
Mjurran!

212
00:14:43,984 --> 00:14:48,265
This town has lost so many
because of me.

213
00:14:48,867 --> 00:14:51,492
I'm the one who caused that tragedy.

214
00:14:52,031 --> 00:14:53,492
Tragedy?

215
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,687
What do you mean by that?

216
00:15:08,578 --> 00:15:10,493
You will know once you see it.

217
00:16:06,898 --> 00:16:08,484
What is this?

218
00:16:08,859 --> 00:16:11,070
Just what... happened?

219
00:16:12,406 --> 00:16:14,070
Are everyone here...

220
00:16:14,812 --> 00:16:16,374
...dead?

221
00:16:18,578 --> 00:16:21,390
Those humans were merciless.

222
00:16:22,382 --> 00:16:24,046
Humans?

223
00:16:27,492 --> 00:16:32,812
As you wished, we accepted
the humans and let them in.

224
00:16:32,837 --> 00:16:34,124
But as the result of that...

225
00:16:34,911 --> 00:16:35,898
Shut your mouth.

226
00:16:37,796 --> 00:16:38,706
Shut it.

227
00:16:41,156 --> 00:16:43,273
I'm deeply sorry.

228
00:16:45,718 --> 00:16:47,429
My words...

229
00:16:48,078 --> 00:16:49,609
My words has...

230
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,470
There are three rules.

231
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:55,056
I'd like you to uphold them,
at the very least.

232
00:16:55,056 --> 00:16:57,476
First, no attacking humans.

233
00:16:57,828 --> 00:17:00,656
Second, no fighting amongst yourselves.

234
00:17:01,093 --> 00:17:03,601
Third, no belittling other races.

235
00:17:03,906 --> 00:17:04,976
That's all.

236
00:17:07,179 --> 00:17:11,046
All because they followed my order...

237
00:17:11,273 --> 00:17:15,710
This wouldn't have happened if
I hadn't activated the great magic.

238
00:17:21,164 --> 00:17:23,859
This woman did what?

239
00:17:25,336 --> 00:17:26,218
Report.

240
00:17:26,243 --> 00:17:31,384
Great Magic Anti-Magic Area
can not weaken its targets by itself.

241
00:17:31,384 --> 00:17:33,010
In terms of cause,

242
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:39,367
it's believed to be more relevant to
the humans that Soei is investigating.

243
00:17:40,406 --> 00:17:41,632
That's right.

244
00:17:41,657 --> 00:17:42,728
I must calm down.

245
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:49,210
This woman tried to anger me
so that I would kill her?

246
00:17:49,986 --> 00:17:52,928
All to protect Youm and Grucius.

247
00:17:56,117 --> 00:17:57,743
Mjurran, was it?

248
00:17:57,743 --> 00:17:59,578
I want more detail about this.

249
00:17:59,603 --> 00:18:01,156
Join us to the meeting room.

250
00:18:01,181 --> 00:18:02,671
Great Rimuru.

251
00:18:02,696 --> 00:18:06,382
If you don't mind, may I join
this meeting as well?

252
00:18:06,407 --> 00:18:10,756
I believe I can provide some valuable
outside perspective regarding this incident.

253
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:12,132
You are...

254
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:13,781
So you came.

255
00:18:14,427 --> 00:18:16,053
That would be a great help.

256
00:18:16,053 --> 00:18:17,388
Mjöllmile.

257
00:18:20,308 --> 00:18:24,132
I listen to the report regarding what
happened to Tempest.

258
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:35,015
The mysterious attackers.

259
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:38,593
And the Falmuth's knights...

260
00:18:39,843 --> 00:18:43,882
Hakuro wouldn't have lost
if he hadn't been weakened.

261
00:18:43,907 --> 00:18:45,666
Hakuro lost?!

262
00:18:46,742 --> 00:18:49,754
He was seriously injured,
but he's still alive.

263
00:18:49,754 --> 00:18:54,148
Along with injured Gobta, the two are
currently being treated by Princess Shuna.

264
00:18:54,173 --> 00:18:55,509
I see.

265
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:58,195
And before leaving, the Falmuth
knights left their warning.

266
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:06,703
This town is contaminated by monsters!

267
00:19:06,728 --> 00:19:09,411
As the protector of the law of humanity,

268
00:19:09,436 --> 00:19:11,825
we won't acknowledge the existence
of a country of monsters!

269
00:19:12,085 --> 00:19:14,911
Therefore we shall discuss this
with the Western Holy Church

270
00:19:14,936 --> 00:19:17,646
to decide our treatment of this country.

271
00:19:17,689 --> 00:19:20,326
We will return in one week time.

272
00:19:20,326 --> 00:19:25,164
Led by the wise and noble
King Edmaris himself!

273
00:19:25,189 --> 00:19:27,953
We are willing to accept your
unconditional surrender.

274
00:19:27,978 --> 00:19:33,664
If you do not, then in the name of
the One God, we will eradicate all of you!

275
00:19:35,984 --> 00:19:37,429
It's a farce.

276
00:19:37,454 --> 00:19:39,710
Yes, indeed it was.

277
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,460
Your town is a hindrance.

278
00:19:44,218 --> 00:19:45,999
That's why we're going to crush it.

279
00:19:46,507 --> 00:19:50,640
Western Holy Church and Falmuth Kingdom
are conspiring against us from the start.

280
00:19:50,665 --> 00:19:56,906
The Church must've wanted to crush a country
of monsters like ours considering their belief.

281
00:19:57,269 --> 00:20:00,035
But if that's the case, what about
Falmuth kingdom?

282
00:20:00,105 --> 00:20:02,576
Great Rimuru, may I?

283
00:20:04,355 --> 00:20:09,027
At this point, a brand-new trade route
that runs through Tempest has been born

284
00:20:09,052 --> 00:20:12,347
and it has already begun to change
the way merchants distribute their goods.

285
00:20:12,816 --> 00:20:13,832
And so?

286
00:20:13,857 --> 00:20:15,669
Trade route is important.

287
00:20:15,694 --> 00:20:20,021
You can profit a lot
from just imposing tariffs.

288
00:20:20,105 --> 00:20:24,323
Falmuth kingdom is known as
the gateway to the western nations.

289
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:26,714
They gain a lot from the trades.

290
00:20:27,621 --> 00:20:32,370
If Tempest prospers,
Falmuth will suffer economical loss.

291
00:20:32,558 --> 00:20:33,238
Yes.

292
00:20:33,263 --> 00:20:35,276
A very big loss at that.

293
00:20:35,276 --> 00:20:36,535
I see.

294
00:20:37,183 --> 00:20:40,855
So I have unknowingly
stepped on a tiger's tail.

295
00:20:43,019 --> 00:20:44,082
Mjöllmile.

296
00:20:44,107 --> 00:20:45,082
Yes.

297
00:20:45,107 --> 00:20:50,519
The current condition of Tempest
and the upcoming Falmuth's attack.

298
00:20:50,544 --> 00:20:53,335
Can you deliver the news to
Blumund kingdom immediately?

299
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:54,644
Of course.

300
00:20:54,677 --> 00:20:57,339
We shall appeal Tempest's rightfulness.

301
00:20:57,364 --> 00:20:58,379
I'm counting on you.

302
00:20:58,404 --> 00:21:00,589
I shall prepare for it now.

303
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:04,933
Well then, Mjurran.

304
00:21:05,808 --> 00:21:11,355
Can you explain to us why you
decided to meddle with our nation?

305
00:21:13,629 --> 00:21:14,675
Mjurran.

306
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:17,379
It's okay. I have nothing more to hide.

307
00:21:23,813 --> 00:21:25,666
I'm Mjurran.

308
00:21:25,691 --> 00:21:27,798
Demon Lord Clayman's subordinate.

309
00:21:27,823 --> 00:21:28,837
Eh?!

310
00:21:30,602 --> 00:21:32,166
Demon Lord?!

311
00:21:41,569 --> 00:21:42,741
I see.

312
00:21:43,397 --> 00:21:46,100
So Clayman is the one pulling the string...

313
00:22:14,124 --> 00:22:17,503
I'm used to losing things

314
00:22:17,503 --> 00:22:22,174
I said it like it's someone else's problem

315
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:26,053
It's a blurry realism

316
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:31,100
Because it's not about me

317
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:36,188
The nameless sadness disappears,
warped in a legato-like dream

318
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:40,359
Will we feel better if we hug each other?

319
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:44,613
The life which I repeat is a joined miracle

320
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:49,159
Don't forget me, pass your voice to me

321
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:56,792
If I were to live for someone's sake

322
00:22:56,792 --> 00:23:01,088
I wish that someone is you
(I'll tell you one more story)

323
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:05,426
If I can redo this world once again

324
00:23:05,426 --> 00:23:10,806
I will paint that story with love

325
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:15,060
You'll know how this story's gonna end

326
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:16,979
I will tell you

327
00:23:16,979 --> 00:23:19,356
I will tell you one more story

328
00:23:19,356 --> 00:23:23,652
