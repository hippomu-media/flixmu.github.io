1
00:00:03,055 --> 00:00:05,969
I won't let any single one of you escape.

2
00:00:15,805 --> 00:00:16,992
Die.

3
00:00:17,258 --> 00:00:19,859
May the anger of the gods
sear through your very souls.

4
00:00:20,375 --> 00:00:21,648
Megiddo!

5
00:00:29,015 --> 00:00:29,812
Report.

6
00:00:29,837 --> 00:00:32,422
4214 deaths confirmed.

7
00:00:32,455 --> 00:00:34,195
4803.

8
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:35,914
5575.

9
00:00:36,499 --> 00:00:39,757
(Episode 35: The Birth of a Demon Lord)

10
00:00:39,782 --> 00:00:44,577
R-R-R-R-Reyhiem! What's this?
What now? What should we do?!

11
00:00:44,602 --> 00:00:47,414
L-L-Let's calm down first!
We must remain calm!

12
00:00:47,483 --> 00:00:49,305
Is King Edmaris still okay?

13
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:51,443
What are you doing?! Protect our King!

14
00:00:51,468 --> 00:00:52,468
Y-Yes, sir!

15
00:00:55,451 --> 00:00:56,992
F-Folgen!

16
00:00:57,017 --> 00:00:59,352
Hurry! We must get out of here!

17
00:00:59,377 --> 00:01:02,336
We must return to our home
and regroup our forces!

18
00:01:02,361 --> 00:01:04,906
Indeed. We have no idea what has occurred.

19
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:08,461
We must leave at once, or else we will
get caught in this carnage as well.

20
00:01:08,486 --> 00:01:11,227
Shogo? No, you are...

21
00:01:11,252 --> 00:01:13,429
It is me, Razen, Your Highness.

22
00:01:13,454 --> 00:01:16,805
Oh! Razen! You did well coming back!

23
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:20,476
Now, let's go home right away.
Using your Teleportation magic!

24
00:01:20,501 --> 00:01:24,719
Unfortunately, I can't use any magic
because of this Anti-Magic Area.

25
00:01:25,094 --> 00:01:26,288
W-What?!

26
00:01:26,313 --> 00:01:27,625
T-Then...

27
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:30,680
Do not worry, Your Highness,
Archbishop Reyhiem.

28
00:01:31,727 --> 00:01:37,414
I can use my Spearhead unique skill to
force our surviving troops to group together.

29
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:41,398
They will serve as a meat shield
and protect both of you.

30
00:01:41,423 --> 00:01:44,523
Oooh, oooh! I knew I could
count on you, Folgen!

31
00:01:44,548 --> 00:01:46,773
We're counting on you, Sir Folgen!

32
00:01:46,798 --> 00:01:48,453
I will go and gather our troops.

33
00:01:48,478 --> 00:01:50,340
Please prepare for retreat.

34
00:01:50,365 --> 00:01:51,856
It shall be done!

35
00:01:59,036 --> 00:02:00,324
I'll die!

36
00:02:00,349 --> 00:02:03,582
Everyone will die!

37
00:02:03,817 --> 00:02:08,871
It can't be! Just what is happening?!

38
00:02:21,074 --> 00:02:22,270
That is...

39
00:02:22,535 --> 00:02:23,715
It can't be!

40
00:02:30,356 --> 00:02:33,106
Are you... the ruler of the monsters?

41
00:02:33,348 --> 00:02:35,660
That face... are you Japanese?

42
00:02:36,012 --> 00:02:38,520
Are you one of the Otherworlder
who attacked my town?

43
00:02:38,545 --> 00:02:40,090
Just the body.

44
00:02:40,115 --> 00:02:41,465
It's different guy inside.

45
00:02:43,192 --> 00:02:45,410
Well, you're still my enemy anyway.

46
00:02:50,164 --> 00:02:52,449
No way! Razen, too?!

47
00:02:52,474 --> 00:02:56,496
Picking a fight with a nation of monsters
was a mistake all along!

48
00:02:56,521 --> 00:02:59,215
What should I do?
What can I do to survive this?

49
00:03:00,559 --> 00:03:03,750
Ah, wait. This could be a chance.

50
00:03:03,775 --> 00:03:07,874
He's the kind of guy who's overjoyed doing
trades with a small country like Blumund.

51
00:03:07,899 --> 00:03:10,906
He'll surely prostate himself before me

52
00:03:10,931 --> 00:03:14,196
once he learns that I'm the king of
the great kingdom of Falmuth!

53
00:03:16,332 --> 00:03:17,692
S-S-Spare...

54
00:03:17,717 --> 00:03:18,949
P-Please spare us!

55
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:26,206
Confirmed.

56
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:30,277
The Unique Skill, Merciless
is successfully obtained.

57
00:03:31,067 --> 00:03:33,957
Merciless? What's that?

58
00:03:33,982 --> 00:03:37,379
A-Are you the ruler of
the nation of monsters?

59
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:42,309
I am Edmaris, the king of Falmuth kingdom!

60
00:03:42,334 --> 00:03:45,817
Bow before me,
for we have matters to discuss!

61
00:03:47,395 --> 00:03:49,176
Are you a body double or something?

62
00:03:49,201 --> 00:03:52,684
Don't worry, I won't lay a hand
on the real thing.

63
00:03:52,709 --> 00:03:54,988
He is no body double!

64
00:03:55,013 --> 00:04:00,168
I swear it by my name as Reyhiem,
archbishop of the Western Holy Church!

65
00:04:00,504 --> 00:04:03,297
All right, I will kill everyone
except for the king. Okay?

66
00:04:04,277 --> 00:04:05,933
K-Kill everyone?

67
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:11,152
Wait! Please wait! I beg you,
please give me your mercy!

68
00:04:11,177 --> 00:04:15,348
I wield great power within
the Western Holy Church.

69
00:04:15,373 --> 00:04:20,402
I will gladly testify that none of you
are an enemy to mankind!

70
00:04:21,363 --> 00:04:22,723
W-Wait!

71
00:04:22,748 --> 00:04:25,293
I told you we have matters to discuss!

72
00:04:25,318 --> 00:04:27,817
What is it? I'll listen.

73
00:04:27,842 --> 00:04:32,777
H-How rude! I am the king of the
great kingdom of Falmuth you know!

74
00:04:32,802 --> 00:04:36,523
Normally, I wouldn't even deign
to speak to the likes of you--

75
00:04:39,598 --> 00:04:42,687
Listen, take a close look at who
you're talking to before speaking.

76
00:04:42,712 --> 00:04:46,203
I allow you to speak, but you
better pick your words properly.

77
00:04:47,028 --> 00:04:49,629
I-It's just a misunderstanding!

78
00:04:49,654 --> 00:04:50,809
What part?

79
00:04:50,834 --> 00:04:54,137
I-I came here to form a friendly
relation with your country!

80
00:04:54,246 --> 00:04:59,145
You declared war on us out of nowhere.
What nonsense are you saying now?

81
00:04:59,473 --> 00:05:03,676
From the moment there are casualties
on my side, you all are my enemy.

82
00:05:03,701 --> 00:05:07,403
The Western Holy Church sees
all monsters as enemies!

83
00:05:07,428 --> 00:05:12,356
So I wanted to check for myself if it
was worth it to make peace with you!

84
00:05:12,381 --> 00:05:16,520
The Otherworlder just started
the war on their own!

85
00:05:16,699 --> 00:05:20,707
H-How about this? I will allow you to
forge a formal relation with my country.

86
00:05:20,732 --> 00:05:23,418
Wouldn't that be wonderful?
A great honor, if I say so myself!

87
00:05:23,443 --> 00:05:26,020
You will profit greatly from it, I'm sure.

88
00:05:26,045 --> 00:05:28,430
W-Well, as the reparations for
what you have done--

89
00:05:28,455 --> 00:05:30,609
Is this guy a genius or what?

90
00:05:30,634 --> 00:05:33,735
Just how far does he want
to piss me off with this?

91
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:50,723
Report. Unique Skill, Merciless has
been completely analyzed.

92
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:56,848
With it, you can seize the soul of those who
are begging for their lives or seeking help.

93
00:05:57,317 --> 00:05:58,403
Which means?

94
00:05:58,428 --> 00:06:03,332
Those who lose their will to fight
in front of this skill will die.

95
00:06:03,692 --> 00:06:05,231
I see.

96
00:06:05,363 --> 00:06:08,363
Anyway, do we have enough souls we need?

97
00:06:08,551 --> 00:06:13,020
57.235% of required number
has been acquired.

98
00:06:13,528 --> 00:06:14,715
Not enough, huh.

99
00:06:14,965 --> 00:06:16,324
If so...

100
00:06:23,348 --> 00:06:25,113
Merciless, huh?

101
00:06:25,138 --> 00:06:29,988
I don't think I can make much use of it,
but it seems to fit this situation.

102
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:34,675
Question. Use the unique skill Merciless?

103
00:06:35,082 --> 00:06:35,937
Yeah.

104
00:06:42,621 --> 00:06:49,113
With the unique skill Merciless, the soul
of all human in the area has been harvested.

105
00:06:49,146 --> 00:06:54,324
However, the individual Edmaris
and Reyhiem have been excluded.

106
00:06:54,973 --> 00:06:56,942
It's really merciless.

107
00:07:00,973 --> 00:07:03,423
W-W-W-What happened?!

108
00:07:06,848 --> 00:07:07,903
Report.

109
00:07:07,928 --> 00:07:13,535
Confirming the nutrient of
human souls needed for evolution.

110
00:07:14,914 --> 00:07:16,463
Confirmed.

111
00:07:16,646 --> 00:07:18,824
Requirement has been fulfilled.

112
00:07:18,849 --> 00:07:21,840
Evolution to Demon Lord;
Harvest Festival will now begin.

113
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:26,559
Crap...

114
00:07:26,731 --> 00:07:29,137
I got really sleepy...

115
00:07:31,512 --> 00:07:35,254
Report. One survivor detected
through Magic Sense.

116
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:36,918
C'mon, really?

117
00:07:37,668 --> 00:07:40,629
Anyway, I must get out of this
situation somehow.

118
00:07:40,654 --> 00:07:44,673
Report. Harvest Festival cannot
be stopped midway.

119
00:07:44,673 --> 00:07:46,566
This is bad.

120
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:47,636
Ranga.

121
00:07:49,254 --> 00:07:50,863
Yes, My Lord?

122
00:07:50,888 --> 00:07:52,879
This is a top priority order.

123
00:07:52,904 --> 00:07:55,355
Protect me and take me
back to the town.

124
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:56,246
Yes!

125
00:07:56,271 --> 00:07:58,106
Take those two as our prisoner.

126
00:07:59,528 --> 00:08:00,370
Understood.

127
00:08:00,395 --> 00:08:03,528
I sensed one more enemy presence,
what should I do with it?

128
00:08:03,553 --> 00:08:06,582
I'll leave it to the other guys.

129
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:15,973
Anti-Magic Area, dispel.

130
00:08:21,126 --> 00:08:24,410
Activate Summon Demon.

131
00:08:25,559 --> 00:08:28,942
I offer all the corpses lying here.

132
00:08:29,451 --> 00:08:31,645
Here, I prepared you food.

133
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:33,434
Heed to my call, Demon.

134
00:08:33,459 --> 00:08:35,255
Come up and serve me!

135
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:52,363
Demon?!

136
00:08:52,388 --> 00:08:57,043
Hey, there's one guy hiding here,
pretending to be dead.

137
00:08:57,129 --> 00:08:59,309
Capture him alive.

138
00:09:01,261 --> 00:09:03,126
This familiar presence.

139
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:05,295
The birth of a new Demon Lord.

140
00:09:05,295 --> 00:09:06,926
It is truly wonderful.

141
00:09:07,535 --> 00:09:10,383
Bountiful offerings and
the first order from my master.

142
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:14,270
It is such an honor, I might unable
to hold down my excitement.

143
00:09:15,277 --> 00:09:18,231
I have been waiting for this day!

144
00:09:23,082 --> 00:09:27,000
Would it be all right for me to
continue serving you in the future?

145
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:29,098
We can talk later.

146
00:09:29,123 --> 00:09:32,207
First, prove how useful you can be.

147
00:09:32,232 --> 00:09:33,122
Go.

148
00:09:33,496 --> 00:09:35,449
It's an easy feat.

149
00:09:35,535 --> 00:09:37,801
Rest assured, Master.

150
00:09:56,785 --> 00:09:57,879
Report.

151
00:09:58,258 --> 00:10:01,672
The individual Rimuru Tempest
will now evolve into a Demon Lord;

152
00:10:01,697 --> 00:10:04,040
Harvest Festival is about to begin.

153
00:10:04,512 --> 00:10:05,715
This is...

154
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:07,426
...The Words of the World.

155
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:12,168
Upon its completion, all monsters in his
genealogy will receive their due Gifts.

156
00:10:13,535 --> 00:10:14,879
Great Rimuru!

157
00:10:17,456 --> 00:10:18,956
Brace yourselves!

158
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:23,715
Our master is victorious! It is now
time for us to wield our power!

159
00:10:35,168 --> 00:10:36,004
Great Rimuru!

160
00:10:36,029 --> 00:10:37,227
Our Lord needs help!

161
00:10:38,293 --> 00:10:39,738
Get him a mantle.

162
00:10:39,763 --> 00:10:42,594
His Thermal Fluctuation Nullification
might not be working.

163
00:10:42,619 --> 00:10:44,519
-Yes, sir!
-Glad you're okay.

164
00:10:58,191 --> 00:10:59,410
Great Rimuru...

165
00:10:59,774 --> 00:11:04,731
Please don't turn into a different person
as a Demon Lord and go berserk on us.

166
00:11:06,981 --> 00:11:10,668
Report. Harvest Festival has begun.

167
00:11:10,693 --> 00:11:14,871
The body will be reconstructed and
evolve into that of a new species.

168
00:11:30,471 --> 00:11:31,822
Confirmed.

169
00:11:31,847 --> 00:11:35,611
Super Evolution from Slime
to Demon Slime.

170
00:11:36,182 --> 00:11:37,603
Succeed.

171
00:11:37,628 --> 00:11:41,010
All physical ability has enhanced greatly.

172
00:11:41,424 --> 00:11:46,372
Material and Spiritual bodies can
now be transformed freely.

173
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:51,541
Next, reacquiring intrinsic
skills and resistance.

174
00:11:51,566 --> 00:11:53,103
Succeed.

175
00:11:53,299 --> 00:11:54,885
Acquiring new Unique Skills.

176
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:58,664

177
00:11:58,689 --> 00:12:01,314
Enhanced Replication, and Universal Thread.

178
00:12:01,339 --> 00:12:02,635
Succeed.

179
00:12:03,494 --> 00:12:07,805
Acquiring new resistance; Natural Element
Nullification, Ailment Nullification,

180
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:11,618
Spiritual Attack Resistance,
and Holy Attack Resistance.

181
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:13,351
Succeed.

182
00:12:13,949 --> 00:12:16,058
Evolution is now complete.

183
00:12:17,027 --> 00:12:17,949
Report.

184
00:12:17,974 --> 00:12:21,511
Unique Skill, Great Sage address
a petition to the Words of the World.

185
00:12:21,536 --> 00:12:23,326
Great Sage request evolution.

186
00:12:23,326 --> 00:12:24,621
Confirmed.

187
00:12:24,646 --> 00:12:28,097
Unique Skill Great Sage's request
accepted.

188
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:31,621
Unique Skill Great Sage

189
00:12:32,753 --> 00:12:33,902

204
00:13:21,914 --> 00:13:23,553

Unique skill Gluttony has evolved
into Ultimate skill Beelzebub.

206
00:13:39,167 --> 00:13:42,011
I managed to stay alive thanks to Survivor.

207
00:13:42,036 --> 00:13:44,985
To think he'd be able to pierce
through my head in an instant like that.

208
00:13:49,917 --> 00:13:52,660
I will now capture you.

209
00:13:52,685 --> 00:13:55,206
Feel free to resist.

210
00:13:55,231 --> 00:14:00,557
I will not kill you, however, I am
not prohibited from tormenting you.

211
00:14:00,582 --> 00:14:01,940
Keep that in mind.

212
00:14:02,066 --> 00:14:05,511
Oh, so you're going to be my opponent?

213
00:14:05,536 --> 00:14:06,542
Opponent?

214
00:14:07,532 --> 00:14:09,738
You're quite a comedian, I must say.

215
00:14:09,763 --> 00:14:13,753
Who are you calling a comedian,
you putrid Greater Demon!

216
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:18,058
Very well. This will be fun.

217
00:14:18,488 --> 00:14:22,480
Allow me to join you in a bit
of post-meal calisthenics.

218
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,730
Don't you underestimate me.

219
00:14:25,386 --> 00:14:26,886
Nuclear Magic!

220
00:14:27,425 --> 00:14:29,269
Nuclear Cannon!

221
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:37,347
He reflected it?!

222
00:14:37,372 --> 00:14:42,940
No, trigger-type magic prepared in
advance has a slim chance of failing.

223
00:14:45,066 --> 00:14:47,785
That magic just now was
quite impressive.

224
00:14:48,597 --> 00:14:49,831
You just got lucky!

225
00:14:49,856 --> 00:14:51,526
Well how about this?

226
00:14:51,551 --> 00:14:53,222
Spirit summon!

227
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:56,706
Come, War Gnome!

228
00:14:57,362 --> 00:15:00,058
High-level spirit of
the earth's foundation!

229
00:15:08,105 --> 00:15:10,113
I see, I see.

230
00:15:10,138 --> 00:15:14,245
Certainly, demons are strong against angels,
angels are strong against spirits,

231
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:16,237
and spirits are strong against demons.

232
00:15:16,262 --> 00:15:22,027
Based on this three-way relationship, calling
a high-level spirit was the correct choice.

233
00:15:22,585 --> 00:15:23,928
However...

234
00:15:23,953 --> 00:15:25,202
What is it?

235
00:15:25,227 --> 00:15:26,866
It's too young.

236
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:40,796
See?

237
00:15:40,821 --> 00:15:42,342
It lacks the accumulation.

238
00:15:42,663 --> 00:15:46,913
Mere puppet with nothing but pure
strength is no match for me.

239
00:15:50,077 --> 00:15:52,717
I-It can't be! That was a spirit!

240
00:15:52,742 --> 00:15:55,975
A high-level spirit!

241
00:15:57,850 --> 00:16:00,171
Could it be... are you an Arch Demon?!

242
00:16:00,196 --> 00:16:01,991
Enough magic.

243
00:16:02,171 --> 00:16:05,499
I would like to test out more of this
body my master has provided me.

244
00:16:05,524 --> 00:16:07,374
Let's change our method.

245
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,655
Anti-Magic Area?!

246
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,358
Why you sealed our magic?

247
00:16:15,383 --> 00:16:18,483
Magic is a demon's greatest weapon!

248
00:16:18,508 --> 00:16:22,436
Feel free to attack me with whatever
physical attack you prefer.

249
00:16:23,327 --> 00:16:26,100
Arch Demon or not, it doesn't matter!

250
00:16:26,125 --> 00:16:29,671
Demon with no magic is
not match for me!

251
00:16:29,696 --> 00:16:32,139
Unique Skill, Berserker!

252
00:16:45,999 --> 00:16:48,241
Those golden eyes...

253
00:16:48,678 --> 00:16:50,272
...and crimson pupils!

254
00:17:00,335 --> 00:17:02,733
This overwhelming power!

255
00:17:03,499 --> 00:17:05,967
It can't be... no way...!

256
00:17:05,992 --> 00:17:09,938
C-Could you possibly be... the Primal...

257
00:17:10,264 --> 00:17:12,436
Oh my, you sure know your stuff.

258
00:17:12,461 --> 00:17:14,889
It seems like you're quite smart.

259
00:17:15,983 --> 00:17:22,983
W-What a horrifying being did that
monster has unleashed upon this world!

260
00:17:31,694 --> 00:17:34,147
Oh my, you're done already?

261
00:17:45,303 --> 00:17:52,959
Well then, now that my first job is done,
time to go to my master for his praise.

262
00:18:11,905 --> 00:18:12,983
Report.

263
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:16,530
The individual Rimuru Tempest's
Harvest Festival is now complete.

264
00:18:17,305 --> 00:18:18,347
Great Rimuru!

265
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:19,365
Is now a Demon Lord...

266
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:23,319
Monsters in his genealogy will
now receive their Gifts.

267
00:18:23,608 --> 00:18:24,749
Gift?

268
00:18:31,717 --> 00:18:32,936
What?

269
00:18:34,413 --> 00:18:35,600
So this is...

270
00:18:35,625 --> 00:18:36,663
...Gift?

271
00:18:37,194 --> 00:18:39,850
I feel strongly connected...

272
00:18:40,421 --> 00:18:42,631
...to Great Rimuru even more than ever.

273
00:18:43,561 --> 00:18:45,858
My... Lord...

274
00:19:19,877 --> 00:19:23,096
Report. Leave the rest to me
and fall into sleep.

275
00:19:34,189 --> 00:19:35,267
Demon Lord?

276
00:19:35,292 --> 00:19:36,384
Did he do it?

277
00:19:41,174 --> 00:19:42,098
Report.

278
00:19:42,932 --> 00:19:45,127
By the name of Raphael, I command thee.

279
00:19:45,548 --> 00:19:50,398
Beelzebub, consume all magicule
within this barrier.

280
00:19:50,398 --> 00:19:53,580
Do not leave even a single
fragment of soul behind.

281
00:20:09,869 --> 00:20:12,931
He gathered all the magicule
in the area?!

282
00:20:13,728 --> 00:20:16,291
Is that... a spirit?

283
00:20:34,814 --> 00:20:36,088
An Arch Demon?!

284
00:20:38,596 --> 00:20:41,314
I am back, My Master.

285
00:20:42,861 --> 00:20:46,588
Normally, I would wait until
the ceremony was done.

286
00:20:46,613 --> 00:20:48,767
Please forgive my rudeness.

287
00:20:48,792 --> 00:20:53,949
It seemed to me you do not have
enough magicule in hand.

288
00:20:54,423 --> 00:20:55,822
Yes.

289
00:20:55,847 --> 00:20:58,595
The stipulated amount
of magicule is not met.

290
00:20:59,181 --> 00:21:01,934
I will substitute it
by consuming my life force.

291
00:21:01,959 --> 00:21:03,825
Please wait, My Master.

292
00:21:04,267 --> 00:21:09,259
I have a good idea. There is no need
for you to consume your life force.

293
00:21:10,541 --> 00:21:13,205
Please use these two.

294
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:17,236
They would be honored to
be able to serve you.

295
00:21:17,261 --> 00:21:21,174
To do so is what gives us the most joy.

296
00:21:22,338 --> 00:21:23,353
Understood.

297
00:21:23,378 --> 00:21:26,202
They can compensate for
the lacking magicule.

298
00:21:26,202 --> 00:21:28,174
That offer is accepted.

299
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:29,697
Beelzebub.

300
00:21:35,652 --> 00:21:38,275
Aaaah, how I envy them.

301
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:46,666
Excuse me.

302
00:21:52,471 --> 00:21:55,689
The prescribed amount of
magicule has reached.

303
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:58,509
Will now conduct the Secret Art of Revival.

304
00:22:01,541 --> 00:22:03,041
Apprising analyzation.

305
00:22:07,783 --> 00:22:10,705
The ultimate secret art of souls!

306
00:22:11,111 --> 00:22:14,458
You're telling me that is a Demon Lord
that just born a few minutes ago?!

307
00:22:17,564 --> 00:22:21,010
Not even the Great Carrion can do this...

308
00:22:21,767 --> 00:22:23,549
Wonderful!

309
00:22:24,721 --> 00:22:28,322
I must have him let me be
at his service no matter what.

310
00:22:30,010 --> 00:22:33,798
The Secret Art of Revival. Also known
as the Secret Art of Resurrection.

311
00:22:34,158 --> 00:22:38,314
An enormous amount of magicule
is needed to make it happen.

312
00:22:38,339 --> 00:22:42,244
And the magic required to control it
is beyond anyone could imagine.

313
00:22:43,517 --> 00:22:46,869
The success rate is 3.14%.

314
00:22:47,353 --> 00:22:52,502
However, that percentage was calculated
before I transformed into a Demon Lord.

315
00:22:54,556 --> 00:22:56,728
Now that I have evolved...

316
00:23:36,707 --> 00:23:40,419
Next time, "The Unleashed."
