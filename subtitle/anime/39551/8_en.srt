1
00:00:03,977 --> 00:00:07,968
Demon Lord Clayman is known
as the "Marionette Master."

2
00:00:07,993 --> 00:00:10,132
He rules over his subordinate like puppets.

3
00:00:10,914 --> 00:00:12,578
That includes me.

4
00:00:13,969 --> 00:00:17,211
My duty was to investigate Tempest.

5
00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:20,969
I used Youm to infiltrate this town.

6
00:00:21,492 --> 00:00:26,508
And under Clayman's order, I cast
that great magic, Anti-Magic Area.

7
00:00:28,562 --> 00:00:33,671
My heart was stolen by Clayman
using his secret spell, Marionette Heart.

8
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:38,680
Ever since, I have no choice
but to follow his order.

9
00:00:39,148 --> 00:00:40,570
I see.

10
00:00:40,595 --> 00:00:43,953
So he literally has the power
over your life and death.

11
00:00:44,552 --> 00:00:48,248
So why would Clayman
meddle with our country?

12
00:00:48,623 --> 00:00:51,006
He once told me...

13
00:00:51,747 --> 00:00:53,583
"This finally gets interesting."

14
00:00:54,092 --> 00:00:59,017
"There were some unexpected things,
but a great war will begin"

15
00:01:02,053 --> 00:01:05,724
At first, I thought it's about
Demon Lord Milim's attack on Carrion.

16
00:01:06,232 --> 00:01:12,411
But seems like he's referring to
the war between Falmuth and Tempest.

17
00:01:13,537 --> 00:01:14,881
Clayman...

18
00:01:14,906 --> 00:01:19,092
He manipulates his subordinates as
he likes and avoids getting his hand dirty.

19
00:01:19,342 --> 00:01:21,021
What a nasty guy.

20
00:01:22,053 --> 00:01:24,295
From the looks of it, she's a Wizard.

21
00:01:24,623 --> 00:01:28,084
But in this Anti-Magic Area,
she's as weak as a regular person.

22
00:01:28,109 --> 00:01:29,321
That means he tossed her away.

23
00:01:29,888 --> 00:01:32,623
Mister, please forgive her!

24
00:01:32,648 --> 00:01:34,248
I beg you too!

25
00:01:34,273 --> 00:01:37,646
She had no choice but to
follow what Clayman told her to!

26
00:01:42,451 --> 00:01:45,513
I will think about Mjurran's
treatment later.

27
00:01:45,665 --> 00:01:48,373
Until then, I will have you
under arrest in this Guest House.

28
00:01:48,646 --> 00:01:49,701
Understood.

29
00:01:49,726 --> 00:01:51,459
We will assign a guard to watch her.

30
00:01:51,484 --> 00:01:52,584
Mister...

31
00:01:52,609 --> 00:01:56,732
Sorry, Youm.
My mind's still not clear now.

32
00:01:56,849 --> 00:01:59,740
If you're worried, I don't
mind you accompanying her.

33
00:02:07,435 --> 00:02:09,546
Would that be all for now?

34
00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:10,339
Yes.

35
00:02:10,339 --> 00:02:13,607
Then let's pay the wounded a visit.
Show me the way.

36
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:15,385
Yes, sir.

37
00:02:29,309 --> 00:02:34,272
Let's give a name to a nameless flower

38
00:02:34,272 --> 00:02:39,277
So that it won't freeze
from the coldness of solitude

39
00:02:39,277 --> 00:02:44,032
If it's as frail as it is beautiful

40
00:02:44,032 --> 00:02:46,951
Then it's not as fragile anymore

41
00:02:48,536 --> 00:02:53,416
Like how you paint color
on a transparent body

42
00:02:53,416 --> 00:02:56,461
Beyond the page of the chapter

43
00:02:56,461 --> 00:02:59,172
It's welcoming you with a smile

44
00:03:00,715 --> 00:03:03,593
Whenever, as much as it takes

45
00:03:03,593 --> 00:03:06,596
Let's start a new world

46
00:03:06,596 --> 00:03:10,391
We're Storyteller

47
00:03:10,391 --> 00:03:14,521
All the love, hope, envy

48
00:03:14,521 --> 00:03:16,439
Even the song of despair we sing today

49
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:20,485
It will all be a seed and bloom,
into a strong person

50
00:03:20,485 --> 00:03:26,491
Why does salvation
born from someone's tear

51
00:03:26,491 --> 00:03:31,788
That's just sad

52
00:03:31,788 --> 00:03:38,628
Ideal and fantasy,
all mixed up by youthful impulse

53
00:03:38,628 --> 00:03:45,385
My real self, is now reborn!

54
00:03:46,372 --> 00:03:51,021
(Episode 32: Hope)

55
00:03:56,162 --> 00:03:57,779
How's everyone?

56
00:03:57,779 --> 00:03:59,381
Great Rimuru!

57
00:04:00,506 --> 00:04:02,263
The potion won't work.

58
00:04:02,288 --> 00:04:04,763
The effect got blocked by
a Space element skill.

59
00:04:04,788 --> 00:04:09,124
Even if I heal them, the effect
won't reach their injury.

60
00:04:09,124 --> 00:04:10,209
I see.

61
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:14,146
Great Rimuru...

62
00:04:14,171 --> 00:04:16,115
Please don't worry about us.

63
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:22,834
Neither I nor my incompetent disciple
is weak enough to die from this.

64
00:04:23,888 --> 00:04:25,928
I'm not worried in the slightest.

65
00:04:25,953 --> 00:04:28,435
Come on, show me your wound.

66
00:04:30,092 --> 00:04:31,092
Great Sage.

67
00:04:31,482 --> 00:04:34,303
The effects of the Space element
have been confirmed.

68
00:04:34,328 --> 00:04:36,744
Use Gluttony to eat its effect?

69
00:04:36,769 --> 00:04:37,940
Yes, of course.

70
00:04:43,756 --> 00:04:44,877
Eh?

71
00:04:44,902 --> 00:04:46,478
I'm saved?

72
00:04:47,209 --> 00:04:49,013
Amazing, Great Rimuru.

73
00:04:49,349 --> 00:04:50,560
Thank goodness!

74
00:04:50,585 --> 00:04:52,615
Great Rimuru, welcome back!

75
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,154
H-Hey, Gobta!

76
00:04:55,435 --> 00:04:57,717
Oh! You're fine, too, Geezer?

77
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,810
Do you want to sleep once again?

78
00:05:00,835 --> 00:05:03,845
M-Master! I'm glad you're all fine!

79
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:06,014
That's why, please wait!

80
00:05:06,615 --> 00:05:09,092
Ah, by the way, where's Shion?

81
00:05:09,435 --> 00:05:12,685
She didn't go off on her own
for revenge, didn't she?

82
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:14,959
Actually, she might really do that, huh?

83
00:05:18,099 --> 00:05:20,060
W-Well...

84
00:05:20,085 --> 00:05:21,662
Great Rimuru...

85
00:05:33,685 --> 00:05:35,584
Benimaru only said one thing.

86
00:05:35,896 --> 00:05:37,920
"Please follow me."

87
00:05:38,451 --> 00:05:42,623
And headed towards the plaza
where the dead bodies were enshrined.

88
00:05:56,513 --> 00:05:57,810
...Gobzo?

89
00:05:57,835 --> 00:05:59,045
Gobzo!

90
00:06:16,787 --> 00:06:20,529
Shion protected a child who
was targeted by the attacker.

91
00:06:21,482 --> 00:06:25,318
But she wasn't able to move as
she wanted because of the barrier.

92
00:06:26,678 --> 00:06:30,170
Gobzo protected me.

93
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:34,102
The attacker just laughed at him,
and then...

94
00:06:43,615 --> 00:06:44,935
Great Rimuru!

95
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:51,912
My bad.

96
00:06:52,704 --> 00:06:54,748
Can you guys leave me
alone for a while?

97
00:06:57,584 --> 00:06:59,099
Understood.

98
00:07:04,381 --> 00:07:05,634
Come on.

99
00:07:23,357 --> 00:07:25,570
Please call us anytime.

100
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:27,155
We will come right away.

101
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:35,205
Warning.

102
00:07:35,205 --> 00:07:39,498
Powerful aura will put weakened
monsters under pressure.

103
00:07:39,779 --> 00:07:40,710
Yeah...

104
00:07:46,006 --> 00:07:47,300
I see.

105
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,310
I gave the Anti-Magic mask to Chloe.

106
00:07:50,232 --> 00:07:51,857
Is the analysis done?

107
00:07:51,882 --> 00:07:53,060
Complete.

108
00:07:53,326 --> 00:07:54,891
Do you want to duplicate it?

109
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:55,767
Yes.

110
00:08:03,692 --> 00:08:05,795
How did this happen?

111
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:07,974
Report. Incalculable.

112
00:08:08,363 --> 00:08:10,323
Just what were we supposed to do?

113
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:12,584
Report. Unintelligible.

114
00:08:13,162 --> 00:08:15,748
Was it a mistake to make contact
with human?

115
00:08:16,123 --> 00:08:18,240
Report. Unanswerable.

116
00:08:19,381 --> 00:08:22,193
Tell me. What did I do wrong?

117
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:24,607
Report. Incalculable.

118
00:08:24,632 --> 00:08:25,849
Unintelligible.

119
00:08:25,874 --> 00:08:27,465
Unanswerable.

120
00:08:29,278 --> 00:08:32,887
My head is filled with strong emotion.

121
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:34,912
But at the same time, I'm extremely calm.

122
00:08:35,834 --> 00:08:37,982
Not a single tears comes out.

123
00:08:39,708 --> 00:08:41,888
Ah, I see...

124
00:08:42,631 --> 00:08:46,537
My heart is already that of a monster.

125
00:09:00,498 --> 00:09:01,523
Report.

126
00:09:01,548 --> 00:09:03,752
No results found.

127
00:09:03,752 --> 00:09:07,756
Failed to find any magic related
to a complete resurrection of the dead.

128
00:09:08,232 --> 00:09:09,382
I see.

129
00:09:11,911 --> 00:09:13,678
What about the barrier?

130
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:14,637
Report.

131
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:18,475
The analysis of the two barriers
covering the town is complete.

132
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:21,513
Removing the compound barrier is difficult.

133
00:09:21,538 --> 00:09:24,771
But the Great Magic, Anti-Magic Area
 can be removed.

134
00:09:24,796 --> 00:09:26,443
Execute?

135
00:09:26,608 --> 00:09:28,498
No. Not yet.

136
00:09:29,709 --> 00:09:33,740
What I really want to remove
is this compound barrier.

137
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,958
But it sure has troublesome property.

138
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:43,750
I can't let them be like this forever.

139
00:09:44,935 --> 00:09:49,818
Their dead bodies will eventually rot,
be reduced into magicule, and disappear.

140
00:09:58,515 --> 00:10:01,490
At the very least, I can have them
sleep peacefully within me.

141
00:10:06,224 --> 00:10:07,545
Rimuru!

142
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:11,945
So you came?

143
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:13,446
Please wait for a moment.

144
00:10:13,818 --> 00:10:16,013
I need to put everyone to sleep now.

145
00:10:16,658 --> 00:10:18,118
A-Actually!

146
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:19,619
The chances are slim.

147
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:22,372
Actually, there might not
even be a chance.

148
00:10:22,372 --> 00:10:26,232
But there is a fairy tale about
resurrecting someone from the dead!

149
00:10:27,818 --> 00:10:29,584
Fairy tell?

150
00:10:29,609 --> 00:10:31,297
What the heck is that?

151
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:33,310
Why are you telling me that?

152
00:10:33,826 --> 00:10:35,301
Stop it.

153
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:37,435
Don't give me hope.

154
00:10:38,513 --> 00:10:42,392
You're telling me there is
more I can do for them?

155
00:10:43,013 --> 00:10:44,662
For them?

156
00:10:45,217 --> 00:10:46,904
No... that's not it.

157
00:10:49,029 --> 00:10:50,959
I just don't want to lose them.

158
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:55,208
You might think it's just
some made-up stories,

159
00:10:55,233 --> 00:10:57,490
but this one is based on real fact...

160
00:10:59,138 --> 00:11:00,545
Rimuru?

161
00:11:00,787 --> 00:11:02,615
Sorry for startling you.

162
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,154
I'm just happy.

163
00:11:05,092 --> 00:11:07,166
Resurrection, huh.

164
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:09,303
It does sound like a fairy tale.

165
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,950
If the chance is not at zero,
it's worth a try.

166
00:11:15,123 --> 00:11:16,843
Tell me more about it.

167
00:11:16,843 --> 00:11:17,927
Eren.

168
00:11:22,513 --> 00:11:26,122
The Western Holy Church groups
are camping near the town.

169
00:11:26,474 --> 00:11:29,678
Each group is protecting
what looks like a magic device.

170
00:11:29,857 --> 00:11:33,756
Looks like those devices are
what created the barrier.

171
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:35,748
Can you neutralize them?

172
00:11:35,773 --> 00:11:37,739
I can take down at least one group.

173
00:11:37,739 --> 00:11:40,241
Got it. You don't have to force yourself.

174
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:42,702
Just keep a watch on the surrounding area.

175
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:43,503
Yes.

176
00:11:44,146 --> 00:11:45,663
Kept you waiting, Eren.

177
00:11:46,006 --> 00:11:49,209
Tell me more about that
resurrection fairy tale.

178
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:50,126
Okay.

179
00:11:57,170 --> 00:11:58,301
It's fine.

180
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:03,529
This is a fairy tale passed down in
the Sorcerous Dynasty of Thalion.

181
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:09,513
A story about a certain
girl and a dragon.

182
00:12:10,787 --> 00:12:15,154
Her parents were a dragon and a human,
and she was raised as a Dragon Princess.

183
00:12:16,826 --> 00:12:19,444
One day, her dragon father made
a small copy of himself

184
00:12:19,469 --> 00:12:24,022
and gave it to his daughter to be her friend.

185
00:12:25,185 --> 00:12:26,185
However...

186
00:12:26,904 --> 00:12:32,043
The small dragon was killed by a king
who wanted to take over the Dragon Princess.

187
00:12:33,435 --> 00:12:37,715
The girl grieved, mourned, and raged.

188
00:12:38,912 --> 00:12:41,474
With the power she inherited from her father,

189
00:12:41,499 --> 00:12:47,576
she killed the king, several hundred thousand
of his people, and finally his whole country.

190
00:12:48,646 --> 00:12:51,982
After that, the girl evolved
into a Demon Lord,

191
00:12:52,365 --> 00:12:56,482
and following that, the small dragon
was miraculously resurrected.

192
00:12:58,388 --> 00:12:59,388
But...

193
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:03,032
The small dragon had already lost
its soul after its death.

194
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:07,495
It is now nothing but an evil monster
who would destroy everything on its path.

195
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:09,849
A Chaos Dragon.

196
00:13:11,318 --> 00:13:16,498
The girl once again mourns, and seals
the dragon who was once her friend.

197
00:13:17,547 --> 00:13:22,443
This tale was the start of the Dragon
Princess who now became a Demon Lord.

198
00:13:24,654 --> 00:13:26,678
The story ends here.

199
00:13:29,803 --> 00:13:32,795
She destroyed an entire country
and evolved into a Demon Lord.

200
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:36,333
Following that, the small dragon she
bonded with got resurrected.

201
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:40,873
It's true that monsters just
evolve out of nowhere.

202
00:13:41,428 --> 00:13:43,896
Just giving them a name was
a huge deal for them.

203
00:13:45,138 --> 00:13:48,771
But there's no point in resurrecting
them as soulless monsters.

204
00:13:50,513 --> 00:13:53,912
This town is being surrounded
by a barrier, right?

205
00:13:56,138 --> 00:14:00,662
If this barrier is also keeping
the souls of the dead inside...

206
00:14:01,049 --> 00:14:02,062
Report.

207
00:14:02,087 --> 00:14:06,240
The soul of dead monsters would usually
scatter and disappears.

208
00:14:06,265 --> 00:14:09,482
However, there is a chance that
the compound barrier is stopping them.

209
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:12,977
(Probability of the souls remaining)
The probability for that is 3.14 percent.

210
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:14,937
As low as value of pi...

211
00:14:15,748 --> 00:14:18,191
No, it's the opposite.

212
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:21,506
There is over three percent chance
they can be resurrected.

213
00:14:21,903 --> 00:14:24,497
All I have to do is to evolve
into a Demon Lord.

214
00:14:26,209 --> 00:14:28,779
Thank you for telling me that, Eren.

215
00:14:30,256 --> 00:14:31,959
But are you sure?

216
00:14:31,984 --> 00:14:34,599
You're basically telling me
to become a Demon Lord.

217
00:14:35,138 --> 00:14:36,349
And also...

218
00:14:37,638 --> 00:14:41,982
The truth is, my real name
is Eryune Grimwalt.

219
00:14:42,396 --> 00:14:45,951
I'm a noble from the Sorcerous
Dynasty of Thalion.

220
00:14:46,224 --> 00:14:47,982
So you're actually a noble lady?

221
00:14:49,387 --> 00:14:53,851
The two of us left our country to serve
as Lady Eren's bodyguard on her trip.

222
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:55,520
Really?

223
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,990
We're sorry for keeping it a secret.

224
00:14:57,015 --> 00:15:01,084
I always looked up to adventurers who
look so free, so I left my country.

225
00:15:01,576 --> 00:15:06,717
But only a select few in Thalion
knows about that story I told you.

226
00:15:07,099 --> 00:15:11,740
If you become a Demon Lord, people will
eventually finds out that I'm involved.

227
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:13,693
But that's okay!

228
00:15:13,718 --> 00:15:16,374
I also want to save everyone
in this town.

229
00:15:16,374 --> 00:15:21,379
I also can't accept what Falmuth and
Western Holy Church did here.

230
00:15:21,379 --> 00:15:25,771
If that's what Lady Eryune wants,
as her bodyguards, I have no objection.

231
00:15:25,796 --> 00:15:27,084
Me neither.

232
00:15:27,584 --> 00:15:28,865
You have good comrades.

233
00:15:28,897 --> 00:15:30,044
Makes me jealous.

234
00:15:32,098 --> 00:15:32,879
Yeah.

235
00:15:33,381 --> 00:15:36,678
If you need something from us,
just let us know.

236
00:15:36,849 --> 00:15:38,904
You have done so much for us, after all.

237
00:15:38,929 --> 00:15:41,607
This time it's our turn to help you.

238
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:42,951
Thank you.

239
00:15:49,824 --> 00:15:52,952
To keep the monsters' soul
from dissipating,

240
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:55,163
I then put on the third barrier.

241
00:15:55,873 --> 00:15:57,631
Just in case something were to happen.

242
00:16:01,592 --> 00:16:03,171
Demon Lord, huh...

243
00:16:03,171 --> 00:16:04,087
Report.

244
00:16:04,185 --> 00:16:08,170
The individual Rimuru Tempest
has already obtained a Demon Lord Seed.

245
00:16:08,195 --> 00:16:11,262
A Demon Lord Seed? What's that?

246
00:16:11,262 --> 00:16:12,305
Answer.

247
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:16,609
The Demon Lord Seed refers to whether one
has the qualification to evolve into a Demon Lord

248
00:16:16,634 --> 00:16:18,859
based on their magicule and possessed skills.

249
00:16:19,693 --> 00:16:23,149
It was obtained from consuming
the Orc Disaster.

250
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:26,920
By fulfilling the requirement, you can
evolve into a "True Demon Lord."

251
00:16:26,945 --> 00:16:27,987
Really?

252
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:30,037
So what's the requirement?

253
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:32,325
Guessing from the fairy tale,

254
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:35,536
nutrients are needed to germinate the seed.
(Germinate Seed) (Nutrients)

255
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:37,955
The nutrients would be a human's soul.

256
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:40,791
Over ten thousand worth of it is needed.

257
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:45,396
I see.

258
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:48,060
Great Rimuru.

259
00:16:48,085 --> 00:16:49,085
What is it?

260
00:16:49,146 --> 00:16:51,334
I just received a report from
the far recon.

261
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:57,131
The allied force of Falmuth and Western
Holy Church is heading towards Tempest.

262
00:16:57,584 --> 00:16:59,894
Approximately twenty thousands of them.

263
00:17:02,107 --> 00:17:03,814
Perfect timing.

264
00:17:03,814 --> 00:17:05,123
Perfect... timing?

265
00:17:05,576 --> 00:17:07,560
No, it's not a big deal.

266
00:17:07,585 --> 00:17:09,237
Thank you for the report.

267
00:17:09,237 --> 00:17:10,321
It's nothing.

268
00:17:10,321 --> 00:17:11,280
Excuse me.

269
00:17:12,451 --> 00:17:13,724
Well then.

270
00:17:16,115 --> 00:17:17,115
Mjurran.

271
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,755
I've decided on your punishment.

272
00:17:20,217 --> 00:17:21,506
I will have you dead.

273
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:22,826
Mister!

274
00:17:22,851 --> 00:17:24,678
Please wait! Mjurran is just--

275
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:26,963
Grucius!

276
00:17:26,963 --> 00:17:30,545
What are you doing, Youm?
Take Mjurran with you and get outta here!

277
00:17:31,451 --> 00:17:32,888
Mjurran, let's go! Hurry--

278
00:17:36,271 --> 00:17:38,396
I loved you, Youm.

279
00:17:39,498 --> 00:17:42,701
You're the first man I've fallen
for in all my life.

280
00:17:43,974 --> 00:17:46,842
Don't fall by a bad woman
again next time, okay?

281
00:17:48,529 --> 00:17:49,735
Goodbye.

282
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:50,695
Mjurran!

283
00:17:53,154 --> 00:17:54,146
Mjurran!

284
00:17:54,824 --> 00:17:57,029
Mister! I beg you! Stop it!

285
00:17:57,054 --> 00:17:59,653
I will amend for her! I will do anything!

286
00:17:59,678 --> 00:18:00,717
Good determination.

287
00:18:00,742 --> 00:18:02,982
I will make up for it for
my whole life!

288
00:18:04,842 --> 00:18:07,185
No way! No! Mjurran!

289
00:18:21,388 --> 00:18:24,020
Okay, looks like it went well.

290
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:26,396
Eh? Why am I still alive?

291
00:18:27,818 --> 00:18:30,154
I think you're dead for
about three seconds.

292
00:18:30,179 --> 00:18:34,428
Well, I did say I will have you dead,
but I have no intention to kill you.

293
00:18:35,656 --> 00:18:36,523
Report.

294
00:18:36,548 --> 00:18:40,411
The individual Mjurran's pseudo-heart
successfully operates normally.

295
00:18:40,411 --> 00:18:41,773
(Operates normally)
Great.

296
00:18:42,195 --> 00:18:45,255
I learned about this
when I put on the third barrier.

297
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:50,796
Clayman is using the temporary heart he
put on Mjurran to wiretap her surrounding.

298
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:51,860
Wiretap?

299
00:18:52,468 --> 00:18:57,070
This emits encrypted electronic signal
and delivers it to Clayman.

300
00:18:57,499 --> 00:19:00,765
So to deceive him, I need to make
it looks like I just killed Mjurran.

301
00:19:00,765 --> 00:19:03,038
I'm sorry for making
you guys go through this.

302
00:19:03,109 --> 00:19:04,143
It's fine.

303
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:06,729
Then... what's this beat on my chest?

304
00:19:06,729 --> 00:19:10,399
It's an artificial heart I made
based on your temporary heart.

305
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:12,429
And of course, there's no wiretap in it.

306
00:19:12,454 --> 00:19:14,278
Now you're free.

307
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:17,031
Clayman can't do anything to you now.

308
00:19:19,171 --> 00:19:20,868
Isn't that great, Mjurran?

309
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:23,562
There's nothing that binds you anymore!

310
00:19:25,796 --> 00:19:26,937
Rimuru...

311
00:19:26,962 --> 00:19:28,593
No, Great Rimuru.

312
00:19:29,296 --> 00:19:32,710
No words can I use to express
my gratitude to you.

313
00:19:33,351 --> 00:19:37,051
If you wish for my loyalty,
then I will gladly give it to you.

314
00:19:37,051 --> 00:19:38,710
No, you don't have to.

315
00:19:39,617 --> 00:19:42,359
But I want you to help me with something.

316
00:19:42,648 --> 00:19:43,648
What would that be?

317
00:19:43,882 --> 00:19:46,442
Just like how you just died and
back alive,

318
00:19:46,467 --> 00:19:48,763
there's a chance we can resurrect
Shion and others.

319
00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:52,523
...Can it be done?

320
00:19:52,937 --> 00:19:55,046
It's still a matter of chance.

321
00:19:55,071 --> 00:19:58,601
And I want to do everything I can
to boost that chance.

322
00:19:59,413 --> 00:20:00,835
Will you help me?

323
00:20:01,788 --> 00:20:03,046
Understood.

324
00:20:03,085 --> 00:20:04,663
I will do my best to help.

325
00:20:05,429 --> 00:20:06,562
Thank you.

326
00:20:07,046 --> 00:20:10,601
So what do you plan to do
after we're done with that?

327
00:20:12,429 --> 00:20:16,155
I finally get my freedom back.

328
00:20:16,953 --> 00:20:21,835
But I don't mind being confined
for a short human lifespan.

329
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:22,888
Eh?

330
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:24,187
Does that mean...

331
00:20:27,538 --> 00:20:29,228
I don't need your pity!

332
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:33,945
Besides, Youm's human. So he'll
live for like a hundred years or so.

333
00:20:34,187 --> 00:20:36,101
After that is my turn.

334
00:20:36,126 --> 00:20:37,351
What did you just said?!

335
00:20:37,376 --> 00:20:39,734
You're really thinking about that,
you shitty werewolf?!

336
00:20:39,759 --> 00:20:41,741
Hah? What did you just say,
you shitty human?!

337
00:20:41,741 --> 00:20:43,826
- You hear me, I said "shitty werewolf"!
- By the way, Youm.

338
00:20:43,826 --> 00:20:46,163
- You hear me, I said "shitty werewolf"!
- I've got a favor to ask of you.

339
00:20:46,188 --> 00:20:47,249
Ah, yes.

340
00:20:47,274 --> 00:20:49,093
I will do anything for you.

341
00:20:49,118 --> 00:20:51,843
Be the next king of Falmuth for me.

342
00:20:51,868 --> 00:20:53,953
Oh yeah, just leave it to me!

343
00:20:55,490 --> 00:20:56,380
Eh?

344
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:57,423
King?

345
00:20:57,965 --> 00:21:04,889
So we will kill the Falmuth army along with
their king who is heading this way.

346
00:21:04,889 --> 00:21:08,225
But of course, that would put
their people in a bind, right?

347
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:10,242
That's where you come in.

348
00:21:10,267 --> 00:21:15,483
I want you to govern Falmuth as their
new king and form a relation with us.

349
00:21:15,483 --> 00:21:17,443
You made it sounds easy.

350
00:21:17,443 --> 00:21:18,986
But me? A king?

351
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:20,237
It's fine.

352
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:23,365
I will be a Demon Lord after this,
so you might as well join me.

353
00:21:23,999 --> 00:21:26,716
Great Rimuru is asking you
because he trusts you.

354
00:21:26,911 --> 00:21:30,515
I will help you too, so why
not try to live an eventful life?

355
00:21:32,937 --> 00:21:34,460
Count me in, too.

356
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:36,601
I will be by your side
waiting for the time you die.

357
00:21:36,626 --> 00:21:37,626
What?!

358
00:21:39,993 --> 00:21:41,918
Got it. I will do it.

359
00:21:41,943 --> 00:21:43,082
Just leave it to me.

360
00:21:43,107 --> 00:21:43,907
Great!

361
00:21:52,688 --> 00:21:54,524
Sorry for keeping you all waiting.

362
00:21:55,157 --> 00:21:57,142
The meeting now starts.

363
00:21:58,571 --> 00:22:01,478
Our topic for today is about our
approach towards humans from now on...

364
00:22:01,946 --> 00:22:04,282
...and resurrection of Shion and others!

365
00:22:14,124 --> 00:22:17,503
I'm used to losing things

366
00:22:17,503 --> 00:22:22,174
I said it like it's someone else's problem

367
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:26,053
It's a blurry realism

368
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:31,100
Because it's not about me

369
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:36,188
The nameless sadness disappears,
warped in a legato-like dream

370
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:40,359
Will we feel better if we hug each other?

371
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:44,613
The life which I repeat is a joined miracle

372
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:49,159
Don't forget me, pass your voice to me

373
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:56,792
If I were to live for someone's sake

374
00:22:56,792 --> 00:23:01,088
I wish that someone is you
(I'll tell you one more story)

375
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:05,426
If I can redo this world once again

376
00:23:05,426 --> 00:23:10,806
I will paint that story with love

377
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:15,060
You'll know how this story's gonna end

378
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:16,979
I will tell you

379
00:23:16,979 --> 00:23:19,356
I will tell you one more story

380
00:23:19,356 --> 00:23:23,652
You'll know how this story's gonna end

381
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:25,863
I will tell you

382
00:23:36,914 --> 00:23:40,252
Next time, "With Everything."
