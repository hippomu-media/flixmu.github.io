1
00:00:05,124 --> 00:00:09,827
After I'm done with my business
in Dwargon, I return to Engrassia.

2
00:00:10,563 --> 00:00:13,891
Well then, I will now announce
the result of your final exam!

3
00:00:20,383 --> 00:00:21,397
Eh?!

4
00:00:21,422 --> 00:00:22,131
Could it be?!

5
00:00:22,156 --> 00:00:23,852
N-No way...

6
00:00:24,227 --> 00:00:26,391
It's a shame, but all of you...

7
00:00:28,195 --> 00:00:29,758
has passed~!

8
00:00:32,586 --> 00:00:34,328
Hey, don't scare us like that!

9
00:00:34,353 --> 00:00:36,852
I figured we need more suspense.

10
00:00:37,117 --> 00:00:38,891
Oh well, that's great.

11
00:00:38,916 --> 00:00:42,180
I-I was not worried a bit, though!

12
00:00:42,205 --> 00:00:44,391
Now we all can move on
to the next grade.

13
00:00:44,416 --> 00:00:46,250
All of us together.

14
00:00:46,275 --> 00:00:48,008
Yes, I'm happy!

15
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,383
You all did well.

16
00:00:50,498 --> 00:00:54,555
With that, all of my duty as your
teacher is over.

17
00:00:54,882 --> 00:01:00,547
Starting next semester, Ms.Tiss will replace me
as your teacher and I will return to Tempest.

18
00:01:01,102 --> 00:01:02,445
Sensei...

19
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:04,633
Don't be so sad.

20
00:01:04,658 --> 00:01:08,047
I will still be here for few days,
so please send me off with a smile.

21
00:01:08,156 --> 00:01:09,921
Even when I'm back to my country,

22
00:01:09,946 --> 00:01:14,663
Alice, Chloe, Ryota, Kenya, Gail,

23
00:01:14,688 --> 00:01:17,281
you all will still be my precious students.

24
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:20,172
Sensei....

25
00:01:20,197 --> 00:01:20,992
Ah!

26
00:01:21,017 --> 00:01:23,984
That aside, you better fulfill
your promise, okay?

27
00:01:24,009 --> 00:01:25,180
Promise?

28
00:01:25,205 --> 00:01:26,101
She's right!

29
00:01:26,126 --> 00:01:30,258
You said you will show us the continuation
of those mangas if we get good grades.

30
00:01:30,283 --> 00:01:32,425
Yeah, I got it all covered.

31
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:35,433
I will give you all volume of the manga,
including Parasite.

32
00:01:35,458 --> 00:01:36,941
Yay!

33
00:01:40,815 --> 00:01:43,760
Ms.Tiss, everyone was able to
pass the exam thanks to you.

34
00:01:43,785 --> 00:01:44,753
Thank you.

35
00:01:44,778 --> 00:01:47,988
It's not me, it's all thanks
to their own effort.

36
00:01:48,144 --> 00:01:51,847
I can leave Class S to you
without worry starting next semester.

37
00:01:52,097 --> 00:01:54,120
Please take care of them well.

38
00:01:54,409 --> 00:01:55,386
Yes.

39
00:02:03,892 --> 00:02:06,142
Look, we're finally here.

40
00:02:08,548 --> 00:02:12,571
That's the country of monsters,
Jura Tempest Federation.

41
00:02:29,295 --> 00:02:34,258
Let's give a name to a nameless flower

42
00:02:34,258 --> 00:02:39,263
So that it won't freeze
from the coldness of solitude

43
00:02:39,263 --> 00:02:44,018
If it's as frail as it is beautiful

44
00:02:44,018 --> 00:02:46,937
Then it's not as fragile anymore

45
00:02:48,522 --> 00:02:53,402
Like how you paint color
on a transparent body

46
00:02:53,402 --> 00:02:56,447
Beyond the page of the chapter

47
00:02:56,447 --> 00:02:59,158
It's welcoming you with a smile

48
00:03:00,701 --> 00:03:03,579
Whenever, as much as it takes

49
00:03:03,579 --> 00:03:06,582
Let's start a new world

50
00:03:06,582 --> 00:03:10,377
We're Storyteller

51
00:03:10,377 --> 00:03:14,507
All the love, hope, envy

52
00:03:14,507 --> 00:03:16,425
Even the song of despair we sing today

53
00:03:16,425 --> 00:03:20,471
It will all be a seed and bloom,
into a strong person

54
00:03:20,471 --> 00:03:26,477
Why does salvation
born from someone's tear

55
00:03:26,477 --> 00:03:31,774
That's just sad

56
00:03:31,774 --> 00:03:38,614
Ideal and fantasy,
all mixed up by youthful impulse

57
00:03:38,614 --> 00:03:45,371
My real self, is now reborn!

58
00:03:46,595 --> 00:03:49,563
(Episode 28: The Falmuth Kingdom Scheme)

59
00:03:51,118 --> 00:03:53,173
She's our new friend.

60
00:03:53,198 --> 00:03:54,930
Mjurran the Wizard.

61
00:03:54,955 --> 00:03:57,806
Nice to meet you.
I hope we can get along well.

62
00:03:58,056 --> 00:03:59,110
Likewise.

63
00:03:59,135 --> 00:04:01,438
Please enjoy your time here.

64
00:04:01,665 --> 00:04:06,788
She's acting as our military adviser and
teaches us how to fight a magic opponent.

65
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:09,321
Then you must be very strong.

66
00:04:09,346 --> 00:04:11,813
It's nothing much.

67
00:04:23,282 --> 00:04:24,759
Are you holding a festival?

68
00:04:25,001 --> 00:04:29,181
No, but Great Rimuru will
be coming home back soon.

69
00:04:29,206 --> 00:04:31,431
So we're preparing to
celebrate his return.

70
00:04:33,087 --> 00:04:36,401
Well then, we still have a lot
more things to do.

71
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:37,782
Excuse us.

72
00:04:38,501 --> 00:04:41,618
And also, please come in and
enjoy the hot spring after this.

73
00:04:41,643 --> 00:04:42,774
Hot spring?

74
00:04:42,799 --> 00:04:45,352
It will wash all your sweats
and fatigue away.

75
00:04:46,165 --> 00:04:47,884
Thank you very much.

76
00:04:55,142 --> 00:04:56,657
So that's Kijin...

77
00:04:56,946 --> 00:04:59,634
Each one of them seems to be very strong.

78
00:05:00,376 --> 00:05:03,743
Well then, Mjurran.
I will show you around Tempest.

79
00:05:10,829 --> 00:05:12,673
Here's the blacksmith's shop.

80
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:16,602
Weapons and armors they made
are the best in the area.

81
00:05:20,727 --> 00:05:22,079
Here's the guest house.

82
00:05:22,104 --> 00:05:23,626
It's awesome, isn't it?

83
00:05:24,282 --> 00:05:25,368
Yeah...

84
00:05:28,618 --> 00:05:30,423
Excuse us!

85
00:05:31,188 --> 00:05:33,290
Oh, thank you.

86
00:05:33,315 --> 00:05:35,821
Here's the delivery
of this month's high potion.

87
00:05:40,204 --> 00:05:41,751
Yes, that would be all.

88
00:05:41,776 --> 00:05:44,517
Your sign please.

89
00:05:44,852 --> 00:05:46,463
Thank you very much.

90
00:05:46,488 --> 00:05:49,690
I believe we will be ordering more
starting next month.

91
00:05:49,923 --> 00:05:54,735
I will drop by to talk about it later,
so please tell Gabiru about it.

92
00:05:54,876 --> 00:05:56,751
Duly noted.

93
00:05:58,993 --> 00:06:02,595
They're producing that many
high potion?

94
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:05,759
They have both the military
and technological power.

95
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:08,751
This is undoubtedly a threat
for other countries.

96
00:06:08,954 --> 00:06:10,251
Hey, anything's wrong?

97
00:06:11,196 --> 00:06:13,501
Ah, it's nothing.

98
00:06:13,595 --> 00:06:15,767
There's a training ground nearby.

99
00:06:27,673 --> 00:06:29,524
What a stupid man.

100
00:06:30,212 --> 00:06:36,235
I was ordered by Lord Clayman to
investigate this country of monsters.

101
00:06:36,438 --> 00:06:40,563
Youm, I'm just using you for that end.

102
00:06:41,251 --> 00:06:42,375
What an idiot.

103
00:06:43,017 --> 00:06:47,149
He didn't even suspect that
I'm actually a Majin.

104
00:06:48,204 --> 00:06:50,212
Well then, you may rest.

105
00:06:58,931 --> 00:07:00,712
That hurts...

106
00:07:00,712 --> 00:07:04,009
The damn geezer didn't hold
back at all as usual.

107
00:07:04,376 --> 00:07:06,438
We're beaten to plump.

108
00:07:06,618 --> 00:07:08,704
G-Gobta...

109
00:07:08,938 --> 00:07:14,016
That demon--err, I mean,
Sir Hakuro is always like this?

110
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:15,938
Yeah, that's right.

111
00:07:16,071 --> 00:07:17,657
Beaten to plump.

112
00:07:17,682 --> 00:07:20,681
Sheesh, it's not a laughing matter
at this point.

113
00:07:21,501 --> 00:07:24,274
C'mon, stand up you guys.

114
00:07:25,149 --> 00:07:27,540
They're doing this? Every single time?

115
00:07:28,868 --> 00:07:34,181
Well, you guys are quite something
too for surviving through all that.

116
00:07:34,206 --> 00:07:37,188
I gotta say, it makes me want
to invite you guys to Animal Kingdom.

117
00:07:37,213 --> 00:07:38,829
Hey there, Grucius.

118
00:07:39,563 --> 00:07:41,345
Oh, Youm!

119
00:07:44,204 --> 00:07:45,727
You look horrible, man.

120
00:07:45,752 --> 00:07:46,884
Shut up.

121
00:07:47,485 --> 00:07:48,352
And she's?

122
00:07:48,377 --> 00:07:50,376
Oh, she's Mjurran.

123
00:07:50,401 --> 00:07:52,282
She's the strongest one
in our group now.

124
00:07:52,438 --> 00:07:54,720
I bet even you can't win against her.

125
00:07:54,745 --> 00:07:55,806
The strongest?

126
00:07:55,831 --> 00:08:00,399
So you're telling me you lose
to this skinny woman?

127
00:08:00,424 --> 00:08:02,642
Then how about you try it out?

128
00:08:02,667 --> 00:08:06,736
If she loses, I will call
you 'Boss' from now on.

129
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:07,781
Sounds great!

130
00:08:07,806 --> 00:08:11,906
If that woman wins against me,
I don't mind being your lackey.

131
00:08:13,359 --> 00:08:17,141
Unlike Youm, I won't hold back
against a woman, okay?

132
00:08:19,032 --> 00:08:20,306
Let's go!

133
00:08:26,657 --> 00:08:28,782
Mjurran, let's call more people
to laugh at him.

134
00:08:28,807 --> 00:08:31,735
And you call yourself a champion?
Hurry up and get me out of this!

135
00:08:33,337 --> 00:08:34,274
Hey, you.

136
00:08:35,087 --> 00:08:36,524
It's your win.

137
00:08:37,055 --> 00:08:38,610
You're quite honest, huh.

138
00:08:38,635 --> 00:08:40,243
I mean, just look at me.

139
00:08:40,268 --> 00:08:41,696
You sure are strong.

140
00:08:41,721 --> 00:08:43,001
I applaud you for that.

141
00:08:43,026 --> 00:08:44,102
Didn't I tell you?

142
00:08:44,751 --> 00:08:47,603
So, Grucius. About that
promise just now.

143
00:08:47,628 --> 00:08:50,540
Yeah, I'll call you 'Boss' from now on.

144
00:08:50,565 --> 00:08:52,688
Ah, well, that was just a joke.

145
00:08:52,962 --> 00:08:54,665
But a promise is a promise.

146
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:56,399
But first, I have to tell you this.

147
00:08:57,368 --> 00:09:03,478
If Great Carrion order me to kill you,
I won't hesitate to do so.

148
00:09:03,899 --> 00:09:07,946
I'm sorry, but it's an absolute rule
that I will not break.

149
00:09:08,478 --> 00:09:09,868
I got it.

150
00:09:09,893 --> 00:09:11,040
I will keep it in mind.

151
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:19,017
In that case, I'll join your party as well.

152
00:09:19,042 --> 00:09:20,884
I also want to see other countries.

153
00:09:20,909 --> 00:09:22,673
I don't mind that, but...

154
00:09:22,915 --> 00:09:23,915
Are you sure?

155
00:09:24,047 --> 00:09:26,445
My duty is to expand my knowledge.

156
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:27,844
I'm allowed to do whatever I want.

157
00:09:28,524 --> 00:09:31,673
That battle was truly a splendid one.

158
00:09:31,698 --> 00:09:32,931
Gobta?

159
00:09:32,956 --> 00:09:35,125
I'm convinced.

160
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:38,970
With your magic, we can defeat
that geezer with ease!

161
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:41,823
Hey, by 'geezer' you mean
Sir Hakuro, right?

162
00:09:41,848 --> 00:09:43,432
Do you have some sort of plan?

163
00:09:43,457 --> 00:09:45,221
Sheesh! Too loud!

164
00:09:45,246 --> 00:09:49,104
Okay, so first, with Lady
Mjurran's magic we...

165
00:09:49,737 --> 00:09:53,159
Just what am I doing here?

166
00:09:53,783 --> 00:09:56,314
Oh really? A mock battle?

167
00:09:56,339 --> 00:09:59,455
Today we will have you pay
for what you've done so far!

168
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:02,565
Are you ready, Geeze--
I mean, Master!

169
00:10:02,877 --> 00:10:05,143
What an awful taunt, to say the least.

170
00:10:05,168 --> 00:10:06,891
That's the spirit!

171
00:10:06,916 --> 00:10:10,432
I will now fight you like
it's a real battle, so be prepared for it!

172
00:10:10,457 --> 00:10:13,026
The magic circle trap is already on set.

173
00:10:13,051 --> 00:10:15,393
All left is to lure him there!

174
00:10:16,588 --> 00:10:18,633
Well then, shall we start?

175
00:10:20,924 --> 00:10:23,440
He's aiming at me as expected!

176
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,463
Liquefaction.

177
00:10:27,909 --> 00:10:28,956
We got him!

178
00:10:28,981 --> 00:10:30,487
Now, get him all at--

179
00:10:31,331 --> 00:10:31,963
Eh?!

180
00:10:31,988 --> 00:10:33,776
Where did that geezer go off to?

181
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:37,284
Did you just call me 'geezer'?

182
00:10:42,768 --> 00:10:43,745
You got to be kidding me!

183
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:45,417
Why he's moving like normal?!

184
00:10:45,713 --> 00:10:47,463
It's Instantmove.

185
00:10:47,488 --> 00:10:49,276
Didn't I teach you that already?

186
00:10:59,245 --> 00:11:02,198
Well then, would you like
to explain to me now?

187
00:11:02,223 --> 00:11:05,971
Just what did you guys plan
to do by trapping me with that magic?

188
00:11:09,706 --> 00:11:10,495
Well...

189
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:13,198
Ah, you're okay, young lady.

190
00:11:13,223 --> 00:11:16,932
I bet these fools begged
you to help or something.

191
00:11:18,854 --> 00:11:21,783
I will say this to you guys
just in case.

192
00:11:22,042 --> 00:11:25,893
But don't you dare try to
'test' Great Rimuru, like this, okay?

193
00:11:25,918 --> 00:11:27,862
What are you talking about?

194
00:11:27,887 --> 00:11:30,721
It's not like this will work
on Great Rimuru anyway.

195
00:11:30,746 --> 00:11:32,096
Are you sure?

196
00:11:32,121 --> 00:11:35,252
He might fall into the same
trap just as easily.

197
00:11:36,385 --> 00:11:38,706
Oh my, did you catch a cold?

198
00:11:38,731 --> 00:11:41,463
No, I bet someone's talking about me.

199
00:11:41,488 --> 00:11:44,034
Well, you're famous after all.

200
00:11:44,059 --> 00:11:46,041
How about another helping?

201
00:11:46,066 --> 00:11:47,744
Let me take that offer, then.

202
00:11:53,245 --> 00:11:54,495
I'm feeling alive now.

203
00:11:54,706 --> 00:11:57,908
That geezer will definitely won't
die even if we kill him.

204
00:11:57,933 --> 00:12:03,698
Gobta, I believe it's better to stop trying
to win up against Sir Hakuro at this point.

205
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:06,197
I will definitely give him what
he deserves someday.

206
00:12:06,222 --> 00:12:08,330
Your guts really impressed me.

207
00:12:08,355 --> 00:12:12,291
Though, still, that magic-user lady
sure is strong, isn't she?

208
00:12:13,315 --> 00:12:14,072
You think so?

209
00:12:14,097 --> 00:12:15,908
Moreover, she's a good woman.

210
00:12:15,933 --> 00:12:17,174
I have no objection.

211
00:12:17,199 --> 00:12:18,955
I wish she would bear my child.

212
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:21,260
Hey, wait, I can't allow that!

213
00:12:21,285 --> 00:12:23,299
She's my subordinate.

214
00:12:23,479 --> 00:12:26,252
Love is anyone's freedom.
First come, first served.

215
00:12:26,277 --> 00:12:28,822
First come, first served? Got it!

216
00:12:28,847 --> 00:12:31,088
Hey, not you too!

217
00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:36,830
What a troublesome bunch.

218
00:12:37,338 --> 00:12:39,088
Rest assured, Princess Shuna!

219
00:12:39,113 --> 00:12:43,025
I will beat the crap out of them
and shape them up from the scratch!

220
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:45,221
I will help out too.

221
00:13:00,299 --> 00:13:02,424
Hey, hurry up and finish that one already!

222
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:04,923
Just wait, okay?
I'm at the good part here.

223
00:13:04,948 --> 00:13:06,884
To think it would end up like this...

224
00:13:07,065 --> 00:13:08,572
Now that's surprising.

225
00:13:13,174 --> 00:13:15,760
So, how about your business lately?

226
00:13:15,785 --> 00:13:19,924
Thanks to you, we got a lot of quality
high potion to go around.

227
00:13:19,949 --> 00:13:22,908
I already spread the news
to the countries in the west.

228
00:13:22,933 --> 00:13:25,666
I'm sure there will be more
demand coming in.

229
00:13:25,691 --> 00:13:28,596
And you will make a lot of profit, right?

230
00:13:28,621 --> 00:13:30,041
Of course.

231
00:13:30,066 --> 00:13:32,520
That's my business after all.

232
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:38,533
But please worry not, I will make sure that
the right pay goes to Tempest as it should.

233
00:13:38,558 --> 00:13:40,572
Not that I'm worried about that,
anyway.

234
00:13:40,597 --> 00:13:44,065
I will also be paying for tonight,
of course!

235
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:48,432
As my thanks for the business
and a farewell gift for today.

236
00:13:48,705 --> 00:13:51,057
I'll happily take on that offer.

237
00:13:52,682 --> 00:13:55,776
Baron Veryard also say
thanks to you.

238
00:13:55,801 --> 00:13:57,651
With high potion circulating in the area,

239
00:13:57,676 --> 00:14:00,722
Blumund kingdom's economy
finally get some steam running.

240
00:14:00,971 --> 00:14:02,940
Veryard, huh...

241
00:14:06,604 --> 00:14:11,854
It's good that we signed
a security treaty, but...

242
00:14:14,049 --> 00:14:15,815
I've been had.

243
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:19,659
If some other countries were to sneak
past the forest and attack Blumund,

244
00:14:19,684 --> 00:14:22,519
Tempest has no choice
but to go and help.

245
00:14:22,658 --> 00:14:25,236
That's how politics goes.

246
00:14:25,261 --> 00:14:29,580
But if Tempest were to be
attacked by other countries,

247
00:14:29,605 --> 00:14:32,104
Blumund will surely come to help.

248
00:14:32,129 --> 00:14:34,744
It's a give-and-take.

249
00:14:34,769 --> 00:14:37,291
But Tempest getting attacked?

250
00:14:37,316 --> 00:14:40,666
There's no guarantee that
nothing will happen.

251
00:14:41,479 --> 00:14:46,978
I predict Tempest will eventually
become a new central location for trades.

252
00:14:47,158 --> 00:14:49,729
Dorf also said the same thing.

253
00:14:49,754 --> 00:14:54,775
And when that happens, there will surely
be a county that finds Tempest an eyesore.

254
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,119
For example...

255
00:14:56,144 --> 00:14:58,924
the Kingdom of Falmuth.

256
00:15:02,869 --> 00:15:05,815
But, well, it's not like anything
will change that sudden.

257
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:09,041
But there's nothing to lose
from being extra careful.

258
00:15:09,354 --> 00:15:11,338
Yeah, you're right.

259
00:15:12,268 --> 00:15:14,518
Falmuth kingdom...

260
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:19,166
King Gazel said that he doesn't like
the king from there.

261
00:15:19,191 --> 00:15:21,697
Like he's too greedy or something.

262
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:28,994
The Champion Youm, huh...

263
00:15:29,135 --> 00:15:31,571
Yes, it is said that Youm
along with his party

264
00:15:31,596 --> 00:15:35,689
has defeated the Orc Lord along
with his entire army.

265
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:39,698
A Champion? What a ridiculous story.

266
00:15:39,932 --> 00:15:44,729
However, we received a report about
Orc Lord from the Free Union.

267
00:15:44,877 --> 00:15:48,658
So it's not all just some
baseless rumor, huh?

268
00:15:49,041 --> 00:15:51,346
As for that Champion Youm...

269
00:15:51,371 --> 00:15:54,213
it seemed like he's using
Tempest as his stronghold.

270
00:15:55,413 --> 00:15:56,940
Tempest?

271
00:15:57,291 --> 00:15:59,494
That country of monsters
people were talking about?

272
00:15:59,666 --> 00:16:02,290
Indeed. With the appearance of their town,

273
00:16:02,315 --> 00:16:05,759
there have been a fewer merchant
traveling past Falmuth kingdom.

274
00:16:05,824 --> 00:16:08,301
Our economy has now worsen
as a result.

275
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:13,502
Because it's now possible to travel safely
to Dwargon without crossing our country.

276
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:18,978
This is a matter of life and death
for Falmuth kingdom.

277
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:21,384
If we let this country of monsters
do as they please,

278
00:16:21,409 --> 00:16:24,190
the news will soon reach
the countries in the west,

279
00:16:24,215 --> 00:16:26,776
making it hard for us
to do anything about.

280
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:28,779
If we're going to strike
them down, it's now.

281
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:32,116
However, evolved monsters are
hard to deal with.

282
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:36,909
Humanoid ones are known to be exceptionally
smart as well, making them a hard opponent.

283
00:16:38,401 --> 00:16:41,385
How many men we can move right now?

284
00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:43,541
Around 17,000 of them.

285
00:16:43,862 --> 00:16:45,221
That's not enough.

286
00:16:47,205 --> 00:16:50,026
Rest assured, Your Majesty.

287
00:16:51,682 --> 00:16:54,049
Archbishop Reyhiem.

288
00:16:54,074 --> 00:16:57,612
Does the Western Holy Church
have any plan?

289
00:16:57,637 --> 00:16:59,463
Yes, indeed we have.

290
00:16:59,488 --> 00:17:03,150
Regarding this land of monsters,
the Western Holy Church has

291
00:17:03,175 --> 00:17:08,919
identified it as a threat to the heavens
and plan to subdue it.

292
00:17:08,943 --> 00:17:14,879
I see, so the Church has already
certified them as an enemy of the gods!

293
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:21,255
However, they have yet to do
any actual harm to anyone.

294
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:26,068
We can move only when
a country asks for help.

295
00:17:27,521 --> 00:17:30,271
A country that ask for help, huh...

296
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:35,490
If, speaking hypothetically,

297
00:17:36,514 --> 00:17:40,226
say citizens of our country were to
receive any harm from this monster nation,

298
00:17:40,226 --> 00:17:42,864
what would happen?

299
00:17:42,889 --> 00:17:44,692
Well, well!

300
00:17:44,717 --> 00:17:47,111
Then the Church will
surely take the responsibility

301
00:17:47,136 --> 00:17:51,737
and send in the Temple Knights to
come and help fight the monsters.

302
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:53,943
That's reassuring to hear.

303
00:17:53,968 --> 00:17:58,716
With their help, we can march
into the battle with no worries.

304
00:17:58,741 --> 00:18:00,021
Very well.

305
00:18:00,466 --> 00:18:02,885
This will be a crusade.

306
00:18:02,910 --> 00:18:06,502
Dispatch an advance team and
cause a riot.

307
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:14,060
Your Majesty, I am thinking to send off
the Otherworlder as a display of our power.

308
00:18:14,085 --> 00:18:15,896
I see.

309
00:18:15,921 --> 00:18:19,435
Those freaks might be
useful in this situation.

310
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:22,029
However, don't let your guard down.

311
00:18:22,208 --> 00:18:27,583
I've ordered them to retreat immediately
after they're done making a scene.

312
00:18:27,873 --> 00:18:33,583
Your Majesty, may I use
my secret spell as well?

313
00:18:33,608 --> 00:18:35,318
Secret spell?

314
00:18:35,724 --> 00:18:37,224
Excuse me for a moment.

315
00:18:51,544 --> 00:18:53,427
That's interesting.

316
00:18:53,452 --> 00:18:56,304
Very well. I permit, Reyhiem.

317
00:18:56,329 --> 00:18:58,122
Thank you very much.

318
00:18:58,147 --> 00:19:02,270
I promise I will bring you
the utmost of glories!

319
00:19:12,269 --> 00:19:14,878
A country ruled by slime?

320
00:19:16,066 --> 00:19:17,773
Are you making fun of me?!

321
00:19:17,798 --> 00:19:20,112
Shogo, keep yourself down.

322
00:19:20,137 --> 00:19:21,933
Listen until I finish.

323
00:19:21,958 --> 00:19:26,081
Slime is a small fry! How the heck
one ended up as the ruler of a forest?!

324
00:19:26,106 --> 00:19:29,015
Shogo does not mean any ill will.

325
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:33,491
Slime is famous as a weak monster
back in our world.

326
00:19:33,648 --> 00:19:37,006
Regardless, you guys will
join the advance team

327
00:19:37,031 --> 00:19:40,499
along with one hundred knights
and head to Tempest.

328
00:19:40,823 --> 00:19:41,839
Understood?

329
00:19:47,261 --> 00:19:50,534
It has been a while since the last
time we have a trip.

330
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:52,003
Don't make me laugh.

331
00:19:52,028 --> 00:19:54,745
Are they seriously sending out
the army just to deal with a slime?

332
00:19:54,770 --> 00:19:57,866
Well, if it really got ten thousand
and so monsters under its control,

333
00:19:57,891 --> 00:20:00,640
then that slime should
be a pretty decent threat.

334
00:20:00,847 --> 00:20:02,323
Yeah, sure.

335
00:20:02,348 --> 00:20:05,960
Humans in this world are just
so damn weak to begin with.

336
00:20:06,831 --> 00:20:09,991
That, or you're just too strong, Shogo.

337
00:20:10,016 --> 00:20:13,702
The unique skill you got
for battle is nuts, after all.

338
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:15,839
Rampager.

339
00:20:15,864 --> 00:20:19,722
Still, I find your skill to be
scarier than Shogo's to be honest.

340
00:20:19,747 --> 00:20:23,222
Yeah. Even I find yours to be
just as ridiculous.

341
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:28,422
But still, damn that old man.

342
00:20:28,447 --> 00:20:30,823
He just keeps on ordering us
to do whatever he wants.

343
00:20:30,848 --> 00:20:35,010
Like, seriously, he's really annoying.
I feel like killing him one of these days.

344
00:20:35,035 --> 00:20:37,417
There, there, don't be like that.

345
00:20:37,442 --> 00:20:39,562
At very least, as long as we listen to him,

346
00:20:39,587 --> 00:20:43,383
they will provide us the best food and
accommodation this world has to offer.

347
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:46,023
Huh? Yeah, no shit.

348
00:20:46,048 --> 00:20:50,820
The best they have to offer is nothing
but garbage compared to our world.

349
00:20:50,987 --> 00:20:52,616
Yeah, totally.

350
00:20:52,641 --> 00:20:54,867
They got no fashionable stores
nor cosmetics.

351
00:20:54,892 --> 00:20:57,609
No TV, no internet, no smarphones.

352
00:20:57,634 --> 00:20:59,836
This world is devoid of entertainment.

353
00:20:59,861 --> 00:21:03,172
I'd be totally fine if it just
blow up tomorrow.

354
00:21:07,156 --> 00:21:11,906
Shogo and Kirara looks dissatisfied,
but this might actually be a chance.

355
00:21:12,664 --> 00:21:17,133
If this turns into a war, we might
get the chance to kill those who control us

356
00:21:17,158 --> 00:21:19,891
and we can finally be free.

357
00:21:38,188 --> 00:21:45,109
At the time, I don't have the faintest
clue that a crisis is approaching Tempest.

358
00:22:14,124 --> 00:22:17,503
I'm used to losing things

359
00:22:17,503 --> 00:22:22,174
I said it like it's someone else's problem

360
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:26,053
It's a blurry realism

361
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:31,100
Because it's not about me

362
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:36,188
The nameless sadness disappears,
warped in a legato-like dream

363
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:40,359
Will we feel better if we hug each other?

364
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:44,613
The life which I repeat is a joined miracle

365
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:49,159
Don't forget me, pass your voice to me

366
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:56,792
If I were to live for someone's sake

367
00:22:56,792 --> 00:23:01,088
I wish that someone is you
(I'll tell you one more story)

368
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:05,426
If I can redo this world once again

369
00:23:05,426 --> 00:23:10,806
I will paint that story with love

370
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:15,060
You'll know how this story's gonna end

371
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:16,979
I will tell you

372
00:23:16,979 --> 00:23:19,356
I will tell you one more story

373
00:23:19,356 --> 00:23:23,652
You'll know how this story's gonna end

374
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:25,863
I will tell you

375
00:23:36,930 --> 00:23:40,180
Next time, Prelude to Calamity.
