1
00:00:05,008 --> 00:00:08,461
And so, we finally arrived in
Armed Nation of Dwargon.

2
00:00:10,266 --> 00:00:14,453
Today we're here to meet the king of Dwarf,
Gazel Dwargo.

3
00:00:28,337 --> 00:00:33,300
Let's give a name to a nameless flower

4
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:38,305
So that it won't freeze
from the coldness of solitude

5
00:00:38,305 --> 00:00:43,060
If it's as frail as it is beautiful

6
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:45,979
Then it's not as fragile anymore

7
00:00:47,564 --> 00:00:52,444
Like how you paint color
on a transparent body

8
00:00:52,444 --> 00:00:55,489
Beyond the page of the chapter

9
00:00:55,489 --> 00:00:58,200
It's welcoming you with a smile

10
00:00:59,743 --> 00:01:02,621
Whenever, as much as it takes

11
00:01:02,621 --> 00:01:05,624
Let's start a new world

12
00:01:05,624 --> 00:01:09,419
We're Storyteller

13
00:01:09,419 --> 00:01:13,549
All the love, hope, envy

14
00:01:13,549 --> 00:01:15,467
Even the song of despair we sing today

15
00:01:15,467 --> 00:01:19,513
It will all be a seed and bloom,
into a strong person

16
00:01:19,513 --> 00:01:25,519
Why does salvation
born from someone's tear

17
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:30,816
That's just sad

18
00:01:30,816 --> 00:01:37,656
Ideal and fantasy,
all mixed up by youthful impulse

19
00:01:37,656 --> 00:01:44,413
My real self, is now reborn!

20
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,982
(Episode 27: Paradise, Once Again)

21
00:01:46,982 --> 00:01:49,152
First, I would like to express
my thank to you.

22
00:01:49,445 --> 00:01:52,344
Thank you very much for
helping Kaijin and the brothers.

23
00:01:52,742 --> 00:01:58,656
Exiling them from here was the best
way to convince the ministers, after all.

24
00:01:59,703 --> 00:02:02,445
So you were planning to forgive
them from the beginning?

25
00:02:02,914 --> 00:02:09,836
I figured it also won't be good to let someone
as suspicious as you roaming in the country.

26
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:16,970
But still, it was a hard decision
to let Kaijin and the brothers go.

27
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:19,811
We were able to produce armor
thanks to Garm.

28
00:02:19,906 --> 00:02:23,844
Dord and Myrd were helping
a lot with construction.

29
00:02:23,869 --> 00:02:28,375
Also, Kaijin helped out
in fields that I'm not good at.

30
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,648
So we managed to work
as a group somehow.

31
00:02:31,891 --> 00:02:34,835
They couldn't do much over here, after all.

32
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:39,172
It was for the best to have them
go and use their talents elsewhere.

33
00:02:39,414 --> 00:02:40,695
What about Vesta?

34
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,023
Is he not here?

35
00:02:42,305 --> 00:02:45,031
Well, I did invite him, but...

36
00:02:46,226 --> 00:02:47,555
Hmm...

37
00:02:48,102 --> 00:02:50,593
Thank you for the offer, but
I don't think I can show myself

38
00:02:50,618 --> 00:02:54,125
in front of King Gazel before
I accomplish anything yet.

39
00:02:54,547 --> 00:02:55,938
That's what he said.

40
00:02:57,352 --> 00:02:59,047
That's just like him.

41
00:02:59,445 --> 00:03:03,922
Then that means he too has finally found
a place where he can use his talent well.

42
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:07,938
So, Rimuru.

43
00:03:09,398 --> 00:03:11,733
There's something I need
to confirm from you.

44
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:12,734
Yes.

45
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:14,609
I'm also here for that matter.

46
00:03:15,844 --> 00:03:18,242
The thing that defeated Charybdis...

47
00:03:18,508 --> 00:03:22,844
Just what is this so-called
high-power magic weapon?

48
00:03:24,273 --> 00:03:28,688
I heard it has the unprecedented power
that surpasses even a strategy class magic.

49
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:32,703
Actually, that really was the power
of Demon Lord Milim.

50
00:03:32,728 --> 00:03:34,227
Demon Lord Milim?

51
00:03:34,445 --> 00:03:37,430
He did say such a joke that day.

52
00:03:37,766 --> 00:03:39,906
But it's not joke, actually...

53
00:03:39,931 --> 00:03:42,219
I'm sorry, but it's hard to believe.

54
00:03:42,351 --> 00:03:43,476
That girl...

55
00:03:44,172 --> 00:03:46,117
Yaaay~!

56
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:48,555
...That Catastrophe class Demon Lord?

57
00:03:48,633 --> 00:03:51,648
Well, I get why you can't believe me.

58
00:03:56,117 --> 00:03:58,938
It's too absurd even for a tall tale.

59
00:03:59,875 --> 00:04:02,461
Very well. I will believe you, Rimuru.

60
00:04:05,586 --> 00:04:07,078
You get that, Dorf?

61
00:04:07,103 --> 00:04:07,992
Yes.

62
00:04:08,017 --> 00:04:09,332
However...

63
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:12,586
To think that you managed to
befriend the ancient Demon Lord.

64
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:15,734
You're truly a man full of wonder.

65
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:21,188
Why does she look so proud?

66
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:23,641
I apologize for the wait.

67
00:04:25,859 --> 00:04:26,929
What's that?

68
00:04:27,351 --> 00:04:29,875
Well, a little present from me.

69
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:43,297
Please enjoy.

70
00:04:45,656 --> 00:04:46,953
For you too, Lord Dorf.

71
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:48,054
Thank you.

72
00:04:48,648 --> 00:04:49,922
This is...

73
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:52,336
Did Dord made this?

74
00:04:52,361 --> 00:04:53,844
Precisely.

75
00:04:56,742 --> 00:04:58,423
It's excellent.

76
00:04:58,423 --> 00:05:00,859
What a thin and fine symbol.

77
00:05:01,813 --> 00:05:04,438
Is this Rune magic for detoxification?

78
00:05:04,555 --> 00:05:05,992
How nice of you.

79
00:05:09,226 --> 00:05:11,805
I won't mind tasting for poison
if you like, though.

80
00:05:12,758 --> 00:05:15,953
I wouldn't expect you
trying to poison me anyway.

81
00:05:17,336 --> 00:05:19,328
This is a fine wine.

82
00:05:23,953 --> 00:05:25,047
This is...!

83
00:05:26,664 --> 00:05:27,859
Delicious.

84
00:05:28,242 --> 00:05:29,781
It's wonderful.

85
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:31,273
Then, me too.

86
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:35,585
Delicious!

87
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:36,670
Warning.

88
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:37,972
Poison Resistance.

89
00:05:37,997 --> 00:05:39,464
Succeed.

90
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:40,812
Don't do that!

91
00:05:40,837 --> 00:05:43,343
What's the point of wine
without the alcohol!

92
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:44,508
What's wrong?

93
00:05:44,533 --> 00:05:46,945
Ah, well, it's nothing.

94
00:05:47,344 --> 00:05:49,641
This is a distilled liquor
made from apple.

95
00:05:49,641 --> 00:05:51,977
We just secured an import of fruits,

96
00:05:51,977 --> 00:05:54,229
so I believe we can mass
produce this someday.

97
00:05:54,229 --> 00:05:55,347
Import?

98
00:05:55,372 --> 00:06:00,402
So you mean you've made a connection
with a country other than Dwargon?

99
00:06:00,813 --> 00:06:02,508
Is it with the Kingdom of Blumund?

100
00:06:02,992 --> 00:06:04,875
Yeah, that too.

101
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:06,421
But the fruits will be from
the Animal Kingdom--

102
00:06:06,446 --> 00:06:07,703
Is it Eurazania?!

103
00:06:07,728 --> 00:06:08,680
Y-Yeah.

104
00:06:08,705 --> 00:06:11,705
The prideful beast king is
doing trades with other countries?!

105
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:16,961
So not only with Demon Lord Milim,
you also befriend Demon Lord Carrion?

106
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:19,547
What a fearsome seducer
of Demon Lords...

107
00:06:19,625 --> 00:06:20,945
No, no, no.

108
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:23,570
I just happened to help one of
Demon Lord Carrion's men.

109
00:06:23,595 --> 00:06:27,289
So from there, we agreed to
do trades with each other.

110
00:06:27,563 --> 00:06:31,391
Well, we're still just sending
out embassy the other day.

111
00:06:32,078 --> 00:06:36,109
Even so, now Tempest will become
the new center of attention.

112
00:06:36,134 --> 00:06:39,946
It might eventually replace Falmuth as
the new main place for foreign trades.

113
00:06:41,289 --> 00:06:42,734
Indeed.

114
00:06:42,759 --> 00:06:44,398
You're overestimating me.

115
00:06:44,423 --> 00:06:48,813
For now, we still have to secure a safe
transportation route to do trades and all.

116
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:51,125
That matter aside,

117
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:56,023
what I'm drinking right now is
better than any I've got from Falmuth.

118
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:58,313
I'm expecting great result from you.

119
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:02,005
The Kingdom of Falmuth, huh...

120
00:07:02,005 --> 00:07:04,841
That's the name of Youm's
hometown, wasn't it?

121
00:07:08,211 --> 00:07:09,172
Got cold?

122
00:07:09,197 --> 00:07:12,336
Sheesh, seems like someone
out there is talking about me.

123
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,478
I don't think I've heard him
talking about his hometown.

124
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:18,992
What kind of country is this
Kingdom of Falmuth, anyway?

125
00:07:19,405 --> 00:07:23,693
Well, they're one of the biggest
country out there in the west.

126
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:28,453
Most of our foods are imports from
Falmuth and the Empire.

127
00:07:29,195 --> 00:07:30,391
However...

128
00:07:30,625 --> 00:07:32,461
Just between you and me.

129
00:07:35,234 --> 00:07:37,188
I don't like that king.

130
00:07:37,213 --> 00:07:38,508
Really?

131
00:07:38,533 --> 00:07:40,438
That king is too greedy.

132
00:07:40,938 --> 00:07:44,756
That's why you must secure that
deal with Eurazania no matter what.

133
00:07:44,756 --> 00:07:49,359
And then, you better share some
drinks to your senior, okay?

134
00:07:50,797 --> 00:07:53,431
You being my senior has nothing
to do with this, right?

135
00:07:54,266 --> 00:07:57,008
It will be all okay~!

136
00:07:57,164 --> 00:08:00,414
Ah! Shion! When did you start drinking?

137
00:08:02,743 --> 00:08:09,742
I'm sure Great Rimuru will make the deal
with Eurazania a success wonderfully!

138
00:08:09,767 --> 00:08:10,657
Hey!

139
00:08:11,274 --> 00:08:17,247
Then delicious food will start lining
on our table every day!

140
00:08:17,247 --> 00:08:23,289
If you put delicious wine on top of it,
then it's practically a sealed deal already!

141
00:08:23,314 --> 00:08:26,180
Just leave everything to Great Rimuru!

142
00:08:34,274 --> 00:08:35,704
Safe!

143
00:08:39,649 --> 00:08:42,446
Sheesh, this girl is just so hopeless...

144
00:08:43,305 --> 00:08:46,961
I'm sorry you had to witness that.

145
00:08:50,141 --> 00:08:52,454
Sorry for what my secretary just did.

146
00:08:52,649 --> 00:08:53,867
It's okay.

147
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:56,024
Just go take her to her room.

148
00:08:56,602 --> 00:08:58,891
W-Well then, please excuse us.

149
00:09:01,446 --> 00:09:03,243
That was so embarrassing.

150
00:09:03,268 --> 00:09:05,125
Yeah, it sure was.

151
00:09:05,852 --> 00:09:07,532
Great Rimuru...

152
00:09:08,891 --> 00:09:12,969
But still, it makes me want to live
up to her expectation.

153
00:09:14,899 --> 00:09:18,892
Shuna, let's check the script again
once we get to our room!

154
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:19,893
Yes!

155
00:09:24,321 --> 00:09:25,977
The next day.

156
00:09:26,641 --> 00:09:32,532
Today is the day Dwargon and Tempest
will announce their friendship treaty.

157
00:09:33,032 --> 00:09:38,922
This is the place for us to appeal to
the people that we're a good friend.

158
00:09:39,375 --> 00:09:43,821
In other words, I'm standing here
representing the whole image of Tempest.

159
00:09:44,227 --> 00:09:48,391
I better give a proper greeting
and leave a good impression.

160
00:09:54,998 --> 00:09:56,846
NICE TO MEET YOU, EVERYONE!

161
00:09:59,928 --> 00:10:05,686
I'm Rimuru Tempest, the ruler of Jura
Tempest Federation, Tempest in short.

162
00:10:11,123 --> 00:10:12,975
Ah, thank you, thank you!

163
00:10:15,771 --> 00:10:16,661
Ahem.

164
00:10:16,686 --> 00:10:22,428
I'm wishing to build a country that serves
as the bridge between monster and human.

165
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:28,586
Dwargon is a place of coexistence and
co-prosperity between human and monster.

166
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:30,505
And it is what I'm striving to make.

167
00:10:31,475 --> 00:10:36,936
I can't thank King Gazel enough
for supporting my ideal.

168
00:10:37,483 --> 00:10:41,201
I hope we can build a relationship
where we can help each other.

169
00:10:41,226 --> 00:10:44,553
For that, I need the help
from each and every one of you.

170
00:10:45,483 --> 00:10:50,191
There are a lot of monsters,
including me who lives in Tempest.

171
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:53,639
It truly is a country of monsters.

172
00:10:54,436 --> 00:10:58,990
However, what we hold dear is
no different from everyone here.

173
00:11:00,037 --> 00:11:03,630
If possible, as opposed to fearing us
because we're monsters,

174
00:11:03,655 --> 00:11:06,061
I want you to welcome us as a new friend.

175
00:11:06,794 --> 00:11:10,669
I promise you that these words
are coming from my heart.

176
00:11:10,694 --> 00:11:13,404
This has been my greeting to all of you.

177
00:11:16,717 --> 00:11:18,100
Great Rimuru!

178
00:11:27,425 --> 00:11:30,308
It was not bad of a speech, I must say.

179
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:35,519
Too short, too humble, too much appeal.

180
00:11:35,754 --> 00:11:37,387
To be frank, it was terrible.

181
00:11:38,418 --> 00:11:42,090
As a king who rules over a country,
you shouldn't act so humble to the people.

182
00:11:42,223 --> 00:11:46,222
Moreover, you will only get yourself looked
down upon by residents from other countries.

183
00:11:47,512 --> 00:11:50,809
Mere wishful thinking is no good
in regard to governance.

184
00:11:51,144 --> 00:11:54,066
Truly great thing doesn't come naturally.

185
00:11:54,091 --> 00:11:56,871
It's something you must
work hard to get.

186
00:11:57,258 --> 00:11:58,301
Yes...

187
00:11:58,879 --> 00:12:04,262
Even back as a salaryman, I'm bad
at doing morning speech, wasn't I?

188
00:12:05,723 --> 00:12:11,332
But still, he's undoubtedly saying
all of these for my sake.

189
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:14,840
I'm truly blessed with the people I meet.

190
00:12:15,277 --> 00:12:16,816
I must be thankful for that.

191
00:12:18,129 --> 00:12:23,801
We somehow managed to get
through the big event in Dwargon.

192
00:12:24,152 --> 00:12:28,373
That's why, it shouldn't be wrong
to have fun at times like these.

193
00:12:28,373 --> 00:12:30,833
Yes, now that I'm in Dwargon...

194
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:33,965
There's that place that I can't
possibly forget!

195
00:12:35,066 --> 00:12:37,214
This is the Butterflies of the Night!

196
00:12:37,239 --> 00:12:39,112
The elven paradise!

197
00:12:45,855 --> 00:12:49,004
Gobta, you made sure that
Shuna and Shion didn't notice, right?

198
00:12:49,029 --> 00:12:50,480
Of course!

199
00:12:50,505 --> 00:12:51,535
Okay!

200
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:53,777
Let's go to the promised land!

201
00:12:53,802 --> 00:12:55,301
Yes, sir!

202
00:12:58,566 --> 00:13:00,113
Welcome.

203
00:13:00,138 --> 00:13:02,152
We were waiting for you, Little slime.

204
00:13:02,269 --> 00:13:04,527
I'm here, in paradise!

205
00:13:07,078 --> 00:13:08,105
Erofu!

206
00:13:08,130 --> 00:13:10,340
Ah, I mean elf ladies!

207
00:13:10,365 --> 00:13:11,738
Are you doing great?

208
00:13:12,293 --> 00:13:13,316
Of course.

209
00:13:13,341 --> 00:13:16,121
Hey, me first, okay?

210
00:13:17,832 --> 00:13:19,424
It's here!

211
00:13:19,424 --> 00:13:21,332
He's bouncing.

212
00:13:21,357 --> 00:13:23,199
I'm bouncing~

213
00:13:28,029 --> 00:13:29,855
It has been long.

214
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:32,871
We thought you forgot about us already.

215
00:13:32,957 --> 00:13:34,410
Of course not~

216
00:13:34,769 --> 00:13:35,503
Really?

217
00:13:35,528 --> 00:13:36,465
Really!

218
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:38,113
Welcome, young boys.

219
00:13:38,801 --> 00:13:40,746
You must be Mr.Slime's friends.

220
00:13:40,771 --> 00:13:41,941
Welcome here.

221
00:13:48,934 --> 00:13:50,699
I will be in your care!

222
00:13:52,402 --> 00:13:54,527
Well, what "care" would that be?

223
00:13:59,589 --> 00:14:00,394
I love you.

224
00:14:00,419 --> 00:14:02,074
Oh my, I'm flattered.

225
00:14:02,613 --> 00:14:04,832
Gobta sure does crazy stuff sometimes.

226
00:14:04,857 --> 00:14:06,926
She let it slide just like that, though.

227
00:14:07,105 --> 00:14:09,621
Your companion is already here.

228
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:16,559
Rimuru, I'm glad that you invite me too.

229
00:14:16,584 --> 00:14:18,691
You helped me a lot, after all.

230
00:14:18,716 --> 00:14:20,526
Please let me do this much.

231
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:23,785
That form does suit you the best.

232
00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:26,098
You don't like my humanoid form?

233
00:14:26,348 --> 00:14:28,199
Well, it's not really about that.

234
00:14:28,224 --> 00:14:29,988
It just doesn't fit my impression of you.

235
00:14:30,457 --> 00:14:31,829
Well, it can't be helped.

236
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:34,075
You should have fun talking with
your brother tonight.

237
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:35,482
Don't be stupid!

238
00:14:35,507 --> 00:14:38,411
Why should we talk to dudes
in a place like this?

239
00:14:38,436 --> 00:14:42,529
We got pretty ladies here,
so let's have all the fun we can get!

240
00:14:42,554 --> 00:14:44,209
He's right, Rimuru.

241
00:14:44,234 --> 00:14:46,763
It's rude to say that here.

242
00:14:47,162 --> 00:14:49,591
Ah, these brothers do
resemble each other.

243
00:14:49,873 --> 00:14:51,248
Wow, Gobta!

244
00:14:51,273 --> 00:14:52,529
You're so good!

245
00:14:57,091 --> 00:14:58,709
Is that so~?

246
00:14:58,734 --> 00:15:01,279
This is piece of cake for me!

247
00:15:06,357 --> 00:15:08,396
Hey, that's dangerous.

248
00:15:08,654 --> 00:15:11,537
That glass is very expensive.

249
00:15:11,562 --> 00:15:14,115
So you better not drop it, okay?

250
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:15,990
So meany~!

251
00:15:19,732 --> 00:15:22,088
And if you drop it...

252
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:23,297
Let's see...

253
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:26,638
We will have you pay for it
with your body, I guess?

254
00:15:42,271 --> 00:15:43,771
It's just a joke, okay?

255
00:15:47,401 --> 00:15:49,380
Manager, can you have a second?

256
00:15:49,513 --> 00:15:51,045
What is it, Little slime?

257
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:53,935
If you don't mind, would you
have this for the store?

258
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:55,693
What's this?

259
00:15:55,718 --> 00:15:58,040
It's a new wine product we made.

260
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:01,662
I'm also giving these to King Gazel,
so I can't give out a lot.

261
00:16:01,687 --> 00:16:03,865
But please try serving it
to some loyal customers.

262
00:16:03,966 --> 00:16:05,529
I want to hear some feedback.

263
00:16:05,554 --> 00:16:06,755
Oh my.

264
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:08,052
But are you sure?

265
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:12,740
I want you to check out how much
we can sell for a glass of this.

266
00:16:12,841 --> 00:16:15,966
Oh my.
You sure are diligent, Little slime.

267
00:16:18,263 --> 00:16:21,940
You're like a completely different person
compared to when you give a speech back then.

268
00:16:21,965 --> 00:16:23,404
Eh, you were watching?!

269
00:16:23,429 --> 00:16:24,498
With my eyes wide open.

270
00:16:24,523 --> 00:16:28,130
W-Well, that... was just an act.

271
00:16:28,155 --> 00:16:29,630
I looked innocent, right?

272
00:16:30,146 --> 00:16:32,443
I will take your word for that.

273
00:16:32,787 --> 00:16:35,161
But still, I got a good impression of you.

274
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:35,920
Eh?

275
00:16:35,945 --> 00:16:38,080
You looked so sincere.

276
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:41,990
I believe sincerity is the key
to attract people.

277
00:16:42,015 --> 00:16:46,295
In that regard, I give you a full score.

278
00:16:49,451 --> 00:16:51,380
I also want to see it.

279
00:16:51,405 --> 00:16:57,310
A country where human, monster, elf,
and all other races can smile together.

280
00:17:00,506 --> 00:17:02,014
Thank you.

281
00:17:07,381 --> 00:17:10,779
And thus, we end our night with joy.

282
00:17:12,850 --> 00:17:15,834
Hey, get hang of yourself, Kaijin.

283
00:17:16,003 --> 00:17:17,588
You drink too much.

284
00:17:17,613 --> 00:17:18,964
Yeah, you're right.

285
00:17:19,842 --> 00:17:21,631
What a bunch of drunkard.

286
00:17:21,850 --> 00:17:23,178
And Gobta got anemia.

287
00:17:24,252 --> 00:17:26,147
Hey, Gobta, are you okay?

288
00:17:27,053 --> 00:17:28,686
My eyes are spinning...

289
00:17:28,711 --> 00:17:29,678
Sheesh.

290
00:17:29,998 --> 00:17:34,694
You all better avoid getting found
by anyone on your way back to the inn.

291
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:37,881
What we experience tonight
is our secret, okay?

292
00:17:37,906 --> 00:17:38,748
Yes!

293
00:17:38,773 --> 00:17:40,350
C'mon, let's go.

294
00:17:40,904 --> 00:17:42,442
Do you need a help?

295
00:17:42,467 --> 00:17:43,670
Ah, thank you--

296
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:47,787
Sh-Sh-Shu--

297
00:17:47,812 --> 00:17:51,571
Warning. Tremendous energy
detected behind that smile.

298
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:53,186
Ah, I can see it too.

299
00:17:53,435 --> 00:17:55,912
Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-Why--

300
00:17:55,937 --> 00:17:58,061
"Why are you here?" you ask?

301
00:18:01,022 --> 00:18:04,397
Gobzo told me everything.

302
00:18:05,293 --> 00:18:08,061
Gobzo, why?!

303
00:18:08,086 --> 00:18:13,551
Eh? Princess Shuna asked where I'm
going, so I just answered her.

304
00:18:13,551 --> 00:18:16,584
What the heck did you just do?!

305
00:18:16,609 --> 00:18:18,022
How awful of you, Great Rimuru...

306
00:18:22,061 --> 00:18:25,842
It was awful of you to leave me like that.

307
00:18:25,867 --> 00:18:28,170
Eh, but, well, that's...

308
00:18:29,537 --> 00:18:31,155
Why did you go off
without telling me?

309
00:18:35,037 --> 00:18:39,209
So it's you guys who invited
Great Rimuru to go on a night out?

310
00:18:51,443 --> 00:18:55,600
I have no intention to stop you from
doing the thing you want.

311
00:18:56,217 --> 00:18:59,115
It's just you made us a tiny bit lonely.

312
00:18:59,140 --> 00:18:59,990
Ugh...

313
00:19:01,057 --> 00:19:01,646
Well--

314
00:19:04,602 --> 00:19:06,562
Excuses will only worsen the situation.

315
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:08,295
I just have to be honest here.

316
00:19:08,959 --> 00:19:10,655
I'm sorry!

317
00:19:10,834 --> 00:19:12,006
Lower myself.

318
00:19:12,031 --> 00:19:13,402
I won't do it again!

319
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:16,614
Then appeal to their emotion
with my slime cuteness!

320
00:19:18,412 --> 00:19:19,553
Okay?

321
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:23,725
I understand.

322
00:19:23,858 --> 00:19:24,905
Phew.

323
00:19:25,358 --> 00:19:28,751
I will let you off the hook with
one week of Shion's morning meal.

324
00:19:28,751 --> 00:19:29,638
Thank--

325
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:30,819
Eeh?!

326
00:19:31,459 --> 00:19:33,162
Are you sure, Princess Shuna?

327
00:19:33,187 --> 00:19:34,108
Yes.

328
00:19:34,133 --> 00:19:35,662
Do your best, Shion.

329
00:19:35,687 --> 00:19:38,030
Yes, I will do my best!

330
00:19:40,498 --> 00:19:44,772
Too short, too humble, too much appeal.

331
00:19:45,108 --> 00:19:48,561
King Gazel, what you said was right.

332
00:19:50,592 --> 00:19:51,850
E-Erm...

333
00:19:51,875 --> 00:19:53,662
Can you shorten it to three days?

334
00:19:53,687 --> 00:19:54,967
One week.

335
00:19:56,108 --> 00:19:57,194
Okay...

336
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:03,327
And thus, we finished
all our business in Dwargon

337
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:06,326
and are now on our way back home.

338
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:11,990
Ah!

339
00:20:12,015 --> 00:20:13,780
There he is, Miss.

340
00:20:14,311 --> 00:20:17,022
He's Youm, the Champion.

341
00:20:20,813 --> 00:20:23,040
Hey, Issac. What is it?

342
00:20:23,065 --> 00:20:26,844
This miss over here wants to talk
to you, so can you help her out?

343
00:20:27,087 --> 00:20:28,266
Miss?

344
00:20:31,105 --> 00:20:36,297
I'm good at magic, so I believe
I can be helpful for a Champion like you.

345
00:20:36,415 --> 00:20:40,954
I heard there aren't much
magic-user in your group.

346
00:20:41,219 --> 00:20:42,531
That's a shame.

347
00:20:42,556 --> 00:20:44,109
We have enough of magic user.

348
00:20:44,134 --> 00:20:46,649
Just what can a woman do, anyway?

349
00:20:48,618 --> 00:20:52,266
Then I'll show you just how fearsome
a real Wizard can be.

350
00:20:59,407 --> 00:21:00,593
What?!

351
00:21:01,243 --> 00:21:02,344
Earth Lock.

352
00:21:05,848 --> 00:21:06,758
I can't move!

353
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:09,993
She used such a simple magic like that?!

354
00:21:10,484 --> 00:21:11,898
Air Shot!

355
00:21:17,719 --> 00:21:18,906
I will beat you down!

356
00:21:26,109 --> 00:21:27,172
It's over.

357
00:21:27,367 --> 00:21:28,719
I'm shocked.

358
00:21:28,744 --> 00:21:32,249
You didn't have any single
countermeasure against status effect.

359
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:35,169
How are you supposed to fight
a magic user like that?

360
00:21:41,351 --> 00:21:42,726
You beat me.

361
00:21:44,547 --> 00:21:46,101
You sure are strong.

362
00:21:46,883 --> 00:21:48,289
What's your name?

363
00:21:48,742 --> 00:21:49,797
Mjurran.

364
00:21:51,156 --> 00:21:52,961
Nice to meet you, Mjurran.

365
00:22:14,124 --> 00:22:17,503
I'm used to losing things

366
00:22:17,503 --> 00:22:22,174
I said it like it's someone else's problem

367
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:26,053
It's a blurry realism

368
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:31,100
Because it's not about me

369
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:36,188
The nameless sadness disappears,
warped in a legato-like dream

370
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:40,359
Will we feel better if we hug each other?

371
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:44,613
The life which I repeat is a joined miracle

372
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:49,159
Don't forget me, pass your voice to me

373
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:56,792
If I were to live for someone's sake

374
00:22:56,792 --> 00:23:01,088
I wish that someone is you
(I'll tell you one more story)

375
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:05,426
If I can redo this world once again

376
00:23:05,426 --> 00:23:10,806
I will paint that story with love

377
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:15,060
You'll know how this story's gonna end

378
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:16,979
I will tell you

379
00:23:16,979 --> 00:23:19,356
I will tell you one more story

380
00:23:19,356 --> 00:23:23,652
You'll know how this story's gonna end

381
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:25,863
I will tell you

382
00:23:36,749 --> 00:23:40,669
Next time, "The Falmuth Kingdom Scheme."
