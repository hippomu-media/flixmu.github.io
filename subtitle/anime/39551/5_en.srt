1
00:00:15,539 --> 00:00:16,859
Finally awake?

2
00:00:17,438 --> 00:00:18,320
Yeah...

3
00:00:18,813 --> 00:00:19,813
This is great.

4
00:00:21,156 --> 00:00:24,063
It was worth it to get
beaten by Master.

5
00:00:24,088 --> 00:00:25,703
What are you talking about?

6
00:00:25,728 --> 00:00:27,460
You're a human.

7
00:00:27,485 --> 00:00:29,492
You better watch out or else you might die.

8
00:00:31,516 --> 00:00:34,563
You're talking as if you're
not a human yourself.

9
00:00:36,367 --> 00:00:38,288
Resting on your lap
sure feels great.

10
00:00:38,288 --> 00:00:41,094
I would love to wake up here
every morning if it's possible.

11
00:00:42,501 --> 00:00:43,367
Idiot.

12
00:00:43,392 --> 00:00:43,851
Ouch.

13
00:00:43,876 --> 00:00:46,859
If you're energetic enough to crack
a joke, hurry and get up already.

14
00:00:48,006 --> 00:00:49,925
Let's go back to our lodging.

15
00:00:49,925 --> 00:00:51,260
Didn't you promise

16
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:53,820
to join in magic battle training
with Rommel and others?

17
00:00:53,845 --> 00:00:56,461
O-O-Ouch, that's enough.

18
00:00:57,891 --> 00:01:00,102
I wasn't joking though.

19
00:01:05,382 --> 00:01:06,445
Youm...

20
00:01:08,508 --> 00:01:09,594
But...

21
00:01:09,619 --> 00:01:12,961
My heart is ruled by
Demon Lord Clayman.

22
00:01:13,836 --> 00:01:15,938
I'm just his puppet.

23
00:01:21,797 --> 00:01:24,625
He's really... just a stupid man.

24
00:01:41,295 --> 00:01:46,258
Let's give a name to a nameless flower

25
00:01:46,258 --> 00:01:51,263
So that it won't freeze
from the coldness of solitude

26
00:01:51,263 --> 00:01:56,018
If it's as frail as it is beautiful

27
00:01:56,018 --> 00:01:58,937
Then it's not as fragile anymore

28
00:02:00,522 --> 00:02:05,402
Like how you paint color
on a transparent body

29
00:02:05,402 --> 00:02:08,447
Beyond the page of the chapter

30
00:02:08,447 --> 00:02:11,158
It's welcoming you with a smile

31
00:02:12,701 --> 00:02:15,579
Whenever, as much as it takes

32
00:02:15,579 --> 00:02:18,582
Let's start a new world

33
00:02:18,582 --> 00:02:22,377
We're Storyteller

34
00:02:22,377 --> 00:02:26,507
All the love, hope, envy

35
00:02:26,507 --> 00:02:28,425
Even the song of despair we sing today

36
00:02:28,425 --> 00:02:32,471
It will all be a seed and bloom,
into a strong person

37
00:02:32,471 --> 00:02:38,477
Why does salvation
born from someone's tear

38
00:02:38,477 --> 00:02:43,774
That's just sad

39
00:02:43,774 --> 00:02:50,614
Ideal and fantasy,
all mixed up by youthful impulse

40
00:02:50,614 --> 00:02:57,371
My real self, is now reborn!

41
00:02:58,787 --> 00:03:00,138
(Episode 29: Prelude to Calamity)

42
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:02,754
I heard Great Rimuru will be
coming back soon.

43
00:03:02,777 --> 00:03:06,019
Then we better hold up
a proper welcome!

44
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:12,898
This is a fine item.

45
00:03:26,498 --> 00:03:28,542
Hey, be careful okay?

46
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:31,086
Watch out for what's in front of you
or you will get hurt.

47
00:03:31,086 --> 00:03:35,507
Well, if they did we can just heal them up
in a zippy with these high potions we made.

48
00:03:35,507 --> 00:03:36,741
Oh!

49
00:03:36,766 --> 00:03:39,572
Ms.Mjurran, good day!

50
00:03:39,597 --> 00:03:40,597
Hello.

51
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:43,141
What a nice weather we're having today.

52
00:03:50,797 --> 00:03:52,711
C'mon, we got place to go.

53
00:03:54,305 --> 00:03:56,336
My bad. It's nothing.

54
00:03:57,796 --> 00:04:01,023
What's wrong, Grucius? Is that all you got?

55
00:04:04,875 --> 00:04:05,829
There!

56
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:11,218
I gotta give a chance for my Boss
to shine, after all.

57
00:04:11,937 --> 00:04:13,344
Gibberish!

58
00:04:13,369 --> 00:04:14,961
-- Keep it up!
-- Do your best!

59
00:04:14,986 --> 00:04:16,015
Now's the chance!

60
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,241
That's the spot!

61
00:04:22,828 --> 00:04:24,976
It has been a while, Mjurran.

62
00:04:26,914 --> 00:04:28,546
Are you doing well?

63
00:04:30,633 --> 00:04:32,875
L-Lord Clayman...

64
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:34,906
I didn't expect you would contact me now.

65
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:41,198
Things over here have been going quite well
thanks to the information you brought.

66
00:04:41,198 --> 00:04:47,000
So great in fact, I feel like returning
your heart which you entrusted me.

67
00:04:47,789 --> 00:04:52,008
Does that mean...
I'm no longer useful to you?

68
00:04:54,289 --> 00:04:56,421
Oh heavens no.

69
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:59,452
I'm still wishing you to do more for me.

70
00:04:59,656 --> 00:05:02,172
I want you to do one more job.

71
00:05:04,445 --> 00:05:07,008
You won't refuse, will you?

72
00:05:07,445 --> 00:05:09,852
It's not like you want to die anyway.

73
00:05:10,085 --> 00:05:14,439
And of course, you wouldn't want to see
the man you love to die a gruesome death.

74
00:05:15,375 --> 00:05:17,437
The man I love? I have no such--

75
00:05:18,625 --> 00:05:20,922
Cut the jest.

76
00:05:21,961 --> 00:05:24,492
Don't you look down on me, Mjurran.

77
00:05:25,133 --> 00:05:29,187
All you have to do is to follow
my order, nothing else.

78
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:35,461
Well then, just sit tight until
I give you your orders, okay?

79
00:05:35,836 --> 00:05:39,000
When it is all over,
I will free you at last.

80
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:43,554
To live with your beloved man
will no longer be a mere dream.

81
00:05:47,062 --> 00:05:48,383
A dream...

82
00:05:54,328 --> 00:05:56,375
How pitiful.

83
00:06:00,922 --> 00:06:02,492
Is this a trap?

84
00:06:03,351 --> 00:06:04,945
That got to be it.

85
00:06:07,953 --> 00:06:09,133
But...

86
00:06:09,711 --> 00:06:10,828
Just if...

87
00:06:12,687 --> 00:06:14,820
My dream can really come true...

88
00:06:17,984 --> 00:06:22,398
I will surely sell my soul to the devil.

89
00:06:26,578 --> 00:06:28,914
Fully armed group of human?

90
00:06:29,179 --> 00:06:31,125
They're the knights from Falmuth kingdom.

91
00:06:31,953 --> 00:06:33,703
They're heading to Tempest.

92
00:06:34,679 --> 00:06:37,117
There are around one hundred of them.

93
00:06:40,025 --> 00:06:45,515
Their objective is unknown, but it appears
Falmuth is preparing to engage in a war.

94
00:06:47,198 --> 00:06:49,140
This might be a bad news.

95
00:06:49,165 --> 00:06:51,244
It sure seems like it.

96
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:52,484
What about Great Rimuru?

97
00:06:52,509 --> 00:06:54,344
He should be arriving here soon.

98
00:06:54,554 --> 00:06:58,578
I believe it's better to inform
this to him immediately.

99
00:06:58,703 --> 00:06:59,453
Okay.

100
00:06:59,478 --> 00:07:01,047
Respond...

101
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:03,298
Requesting for respond.

102
00:07:03,812 --> 00:07:07,054
I'm one of the Three Beastketeers
of Animal Kingdom of Eurazania.

103
00:07:07,079 --> 00:07:08,887
Albis the Golden Serpent.

104
00:07:08,887 --> 00:07:10,296
Lady Albis!

105
00:07:10,321 --> 00:07:11,848
Benimaru here. What's wrong?

106
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:13,375
We have a favor.

107
00:07:13,922 --> 00:07:18,133
We want you to accept refugee
from our country.

108
00:07:18,158 --> 00:07:19,356
Refugee?

109
00:07:19,356 --> 00:07:20,649
What happened?

110
00:07:20,649 --> 00:07:24,344
Eurazania will enter a state of war
in one week.

111
00:07:24,369 --> 00:07:25,445
A war?!

112
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:26,476
With which country?

113
00:07:26,976 --> 00:07:28,711
It's not a country.

114
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:30,453
Our opponent...

115
00:07:31,195 --> 00:07:32,703
Is the Demon Lord Milim.

116
00:07:34,859 --> 00:07:36,874
Hey, what does that--

117
00:07:50,445 --> 00:07:51,763
Hey!

118
00:07:51,763 --> 00:07:53,687
Hey! Hey! Hey!

119
00:07:55,133 --> 00:07:58,375
This country is much more advanced
than Falmuth!

120
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,438
You got to be kidding me!

121
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:03,508
Why the hell are monsters
living better than we are?!

122
00:08:03,533 --> 00:08:05,171
Yeah, what's the deal with this?

123
00:08:05,196 --> 00:08:07,648
Why are they getting
better stuff than us?!

124
00:08:07,673 --> 00:08:09,461
This ruins my mood, totally.

125
00:08:09,486 --> 00:08:11,250
There, there, Kirara.

126
00:08:11,461 --> 00:08:13,640
But you have a point.

127
00:08:17,953 --> 00:08:19,851
This is not interesting.

128
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:22,000
This place is running by a slime, right?

129
00:08:22,025 --> 00:08:25,695
If we kill that damn thing, we can
take over this whole town, right?

130
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:28,554
That's a nice idea, I'm on it!

131
00:08:28,579 --> 00:08:31,906
I like that idea too, but we can't
stray from our orders too much.

132
00:08:31,931 --> 00:08:33,437
That would fine.

133
00:08:33,836 --> 00:08:36,599
We're here to cause a riot, right?

134
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:38,268
Then it's a perfect opportunity.

135
00:08:38,268 --> 00:08:39,687
Yeah, totally.

136
00:08:39,712 --> 00:08:43,867
We just need the "record" that
monsters do attack lawful citizens.

137
00:08:43,892 --> 00:08:47,742
True, that is what Sir Razen told us to do.

138
00:08:48,414 --> 00:08:50,500
Quit calling that geezer with "Sir."

139
00:08:50,525 --> 00:08:51,742
Totally.

140
00:08:51,767 --> 00:08:54,015
I wish that geezer would just die already.

141
00:08:54,187 --> 00:08:56,765
Then we'd be free at last.

142
00:08:57,812 --> 00:08:59,461
Sorry, it's a habit.

143
00:08:59,555 --> 00:09:02,875
It would be bad if we diss him
right in front of his face, right?

144
00:09:03,086 --> 00:09:04,367
Well then!

145
00:09:04,586 --> 00:09:06,492
Let's start right away!

146
00:09:21,109 --> 00:09:23,906
Y-You just touched
my butt just now, didn't you?

147
00:09:23,931 --> 00:09:25,969
Could it be you were trying
to assault me just now?

148
00:09:26,383 --> 00:09:28,679
But I didn't do anything!

149
00:09:28,704 --> 00:09:30,875
Don't play dumb with me!

150
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:35,600
I'm telling you to explain to me what
intention do you have when you assault me!

151
00:09:35,826 --> 00:09:36,998
Do you understand?

152
00:09:39,959 --> 00:09:41,537
That hurts~!

153
00:09:41,865 --> 00:09:45,764
Hey, did that hobgoblin
just attack that girl?

154
00:09:46,553 --> 00:09:48,319
He's this town's guard.

155
00:09:48,344 --> 00:09:49,326
Seriously?

156
00:09:49,351 --> 00:09:52,209
I heard monsters here are supposed
to be calm and friendly.

157
00:09:52,234 --> 00:09:54,344
So monsters really are
monsters in the end, huh.

158
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:58,389
Kirara's unique skill sure is scary.

159
00:09:58,389 --> 00:09:59,474
Yes.

160
00:09:59,474 --> 00:10:02,977
Bewilder affects your mind on
unconscious level, after all.

161
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:06,170
They will believe in Kirara's words
and do as she says.

162
00:10:08,194 --> 00:10:12,615
Whoa there, so people in this town
would attack visitors?

163
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:16,638
So this is all your plan
all along, monsters?

164
00:10:16,663 --> 00:10:19,115
Now that you think about it,
he does have quite a nasty look.

165
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:20,912
Then it must be on purpose.

166
00:10:20,912 --> 00:10:23,881
Hey, won't it be better to call
the guards?

167
00:10:23,906 --> 00:10:25,647
N-No, this is a mistake.

168
00:10:25,672 --> 00:10:27,717
I didn't do anything.

169
00:10:28,092 --> 00:10:31,654
What Falmuth wants is an excuse
to invade this country.

170
00:10:32,225 --> 00:10:35,803
In other words, the "fact" that
monsters harmed a human.

171
00:10:36,404 --> 00:10:41,474
It would have been much more impactful
if this idiot-face gets angry, but oh well.

172
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:43,264
What's up with this commotion?

173
00:10:44,545 --> 00:10:46,187
What's wrong, Gobzo?

174
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:47,967
I, I just...

175
00:10:47,992 --> 00:10:51,109
You sure cause us trouble
every once in a while.

176
00:10:54,404 --> 00:10:57,725
We're very sorry. I will make
sure to educate him properly.

177
00:10:58,287 --> 00:11:00,701
Gobta, but I...

178
00:11:00,726 --> 00:11:02,287
You didn't do anything, right?

179
00:11:02,287 --> 00:11:04,581
But that doesn't matter.

180
00:11:04,581 --> 00:11:06,795
It's our lost once they
start suspecting us.

181
00:11:07,115 --> 00:11:10,962
G-Gobta, so you really believe in me?

182
00:11:10,962 --> 00:11:13,990
It's needless to say.

183
00:11:14,951 --> 00:11:16,194
I will follow you forever!

184
00:11:16,219 --> 00:11:18,842
Eh, c'mon, that's enough.

185
00:11:18,867 --> 00:11:20,795
H-Hey, what's up with that!

186
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:23,819
Are you trying to say that I'm lying?!

187
00:11:23,844 --> 00:11:26,319
Oh, it didn't sound that way?

188
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:29,701
Don't give me that, you shitty goblin!

189
00:11:29,726 --> 00:11:32,139
You got a nerve
trying to pick a fight with me!

190
00:11:32,164 --> 00:11:36,100
You didn't even see anything, so how
could you even believe in him?

191
00:11:36,125 --> 00:11:38,451
It's natural for us to trust our friends.

192
00:11:38,476 --> 00:11:41,784
What? Do you think that lame
excuse can convince me?!

193
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:45,288
To begin with, this guy over here
got a thing for Shion.

194
00:11:45,811 --> 00:11:48,295
She's like, "this" great.

195
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:52,514
So there's no way he'd try to lay
his hand on a young lady like you.

196
00:11:54,209 --> 00:11:57,170
Hey, why did you say that!
It's supposed to be a secret!

197
00:11:57,195 --> 00:11:59,966
Everyone knows about it already,
it's already too late for that.

198
00:11:59,991 --> 00:12:01,334
Everyone?

199
00:12:01,359 --> 00:12:02,779
Yes, everyone.

200
00:12:02,804 --> 00:12:04,467
You better just give up, Gobzo.

201
00:12:04,492 --> 00:12:09,103
I thought about following you forever,
but not anymore!

202
00:12:14,748 --> 00:12:16,686
That's it, you pile of shits.

203
00:12:16,711 --> 00:12:18,811
There's no holding back now!

204
00:12:19,264 --> 00:12:21,029
All of you...

205
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:24,619
...will die now!

206
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:28,289
(Unique skill: Bewilder)

207
00:12:33,397 --> 00:12:35,129
There she did it.

208
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:36,803
Serves you right.

209
00:12:47,084 --> 00:12:49,522
No way, why won't anyone die?

210
00:12:49,811 --> 00:12:51,154
I see.

211
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:55,248
So your skill converts your
voice into wavelength

212
00:12:55,273 --> 00:12:57,599
and interfere with
your targets' brainwaves.

213
00:13:01,475 --> 00:13:07,319
It's a very fearsome power, so I hereby
prohibit you from using it in this country.

214
00:13:08,006 --> 00:13:12,756
This woman. She nullifies the power
of my skill, the Bewilder.

215
00:13:18,154 --> 00:13:21,826
It seems like you people do
not belong in this country.

216
00:13:22,342 --> 00:13:24,554
Please, leave now.

217
00:13:24,554 --> 00:13:27,029
No way... I can't believe this.

218
00:13:27,662 --> 00:13:29,740
They're like a real monster.

219
00:13:30,529 --> 00:13:31,519
I see.

220
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,479
So that's how you want to do this.

221
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:38,623
Fine by me. If that's what you want,
I will get serious too.

222
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,989
I will make you my slave.

223
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:45,779
I will torment you until you beg
for my forgiveness.

224
00:13:46,444 --> 00:13:47,827
You lowlife.

225
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:50,490
Your licentious thoughts are written
all over your face.

226
00:13:52,334 --> 00:13:55,626
We will not harm you if you agree
to leave this town peacefully.

227
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:58,944
However, if you refuse to do so...

228
00:14:00,131 --> 00:14:01,591
Interesting!

229
00:14:01,591 --> 00:14:04,037
If you're going in my way,
then I will crush you!

230
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:08,765
I see.

231
00:14:08,765 --> 00:14:11,787
Seems like you won't learn
a thing without a beating.

232
00:14:13,709 --> 00:14:16,483
Very well. I will be your opponent.

233
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:23,373
Now that it comes to this,
I will do as I wish.

234
00:14:25,404 --> 00:14:29,311
The truth is, I have always wanted
to test out this power.

235
00:14:31,717 --> 00:14:36,084
I can't wait to find out just
what can I do with my Severer.

236
00:14:36,084 --> 00:14:38,086
(Unique skill: Severer)

237
00:14:38,319 --> 00:14:40,004
This looks dangerous.

238
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:43,092
Gobzo, you better go and protect
Princess Shuna.

239
00:14:43,117 --> 00:14:44,600
Y-Yes, I got it!

240
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:48,679
(Extra skill: All Seeing Eye)

241
00:14:50,654 --> 00:14:54,733
With my power, I won't lose even
to that old hag Hinata!

242
00:14:54,758 --> 00:14:57,529
Much less to a small fry like you!

243
00:15:01,733 --> 00:15:03,069
A high magic?

244
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:07,990
Yes. I want you to turn the Central City
of Rimuru into an anti-magic area.

245
00:15:08,491 --> 00:15:11,615
The goal is to cut any
contact with outside forces.

246
00:15:11,725 --> 00:15:13,615
Get right on it immediately.

247
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:15,701
This will be your last job.

248
00:15:17,069 --> 00:15:18,876
This finally gets interesting.

249
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:21,087
A great war will begin.

250
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:24,841
An unforeseen flow has brought up
an unexpected development.

251
00:15:24,841 --> 00:15:26,843
Well then, shall we see.

252
00:15:27,218 --> 00:15:28,761
Where are you going?

253
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:33,266
Do you need something from me?

254
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:34,615
Cream puff.

255
00:15:35,022 --> 00:15:36,853
Cream puff?

256
00:15:36,853 --> 00:15:38,881
It's a new type of dessert.

257
00:15:38,906 --> 00:15:40,639
They just got it over at the dining hall.

258
00:15:40,664 --> 00:15:43,137
I heard it's really delicious.
Let's go and eat it.

259
00:15:43,162 --> 00:15:46,974
Thank you for the offer,
but I just ate one yesterday.

260
00:15:46,999 --> 00:15:48,551
Is it with Youm?

261
00:15:48,576 --> 00:15:49,600
Y-Yeah.

262
00:15:49,625 --> 00:15:52,865
Tch, that bastard. Trying to
be a step ahead of me again.

263
00:15:54,092 --> 00:15:57,123
I have a business to attend to,
so see you later.

264
00:15:57,123 --> 00:15:58,092
Later?

265
00:15:59,022 --> 00:16:00,842
Will we really meet again later?

266
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:07,397
I actually got quite a peculiar
news just now.

267
00:16:08,259 --> 00:16:11,637
It says we just received a declaration
of war from Demon Lord Milim.

268
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:13,881
What a ridiculous story, I thought.

269
00:16:14,154 --> 00:16:17,226
But I saw you acting pretty suspicious.

270
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:19,272
So I got a bit curious.

271
00:16:20,217 --> 00:16:22,631
So this is why Clayman
is rushing on things.

272
00:16:23,024 --> 00:16:26,451
Demon Lord Milim's declaration
of war must be unexpected to him.

273
00:16:26,569 --> 00:16:28,459
I'm sorry, I'm in a hurry.

274
00:16:28,484 --> 00:16:29,490
Mjurran!

275
00:16:29,928 --> 00:16:34,420
But still, why does he want to cut
off all communication from this country?

276
00:16:35,076 --> 00:16:37,693
I see. It must be because
of Rimuru Tempest.

277
00:16:37,718 --> 00:16:41,201
He's scared of that Slime getting
the news and join in early.

278
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:42,373
Mjurran!

279
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:46,214
I must hurry up and
activate the magic as ordered.

280
00:16:46,214 --> 00:16:47,924
Or else Clayman would get angry

281
00:16:47,924 --> 00:16:52,162
and kill not only me but
everyone else in this town.

282
00:16:52,187 --> 00:16:53,053
Hey!

283
00:16:53,638 --> 00:16:57,959
If Demon Lord Milim is the opponent,
won't your master also be in danger?

284
00:16:59,769 --> 00:17:02,688
You speak as if you know
about Demon Lord Milim.

285
00:17:04,725 --> 00:17:07,985
No need to worry,
Great Carrion is invincible.

286
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:10,196
There is no way he would
be defeated.

287
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:13,404
What important here is you.

288
00:17:15,279 --> 00:17:17,397
You're a Majin, right?

289
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:24,794
Just why are you so sharp
only at times like these?

290
00:17:24,794 --> 00:17:25,779
Then--

291
00:17:25,804 --> 00:17:27,922
But I have no choice, Grucius.

292
00:17:28,923 --> 00:17:31,467
I like you too.

293
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:33,154
As a friend, that is.

294
00:17:34,845 --> 00:17:36,222
However...

295
00:17:36,222 --> 00:17:38,266
If you're going to get in my way...

296
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:45,467
I won't hesitate to kill you.

297
00:17:47,639 --> 00:17:49,951
You... are that determined?

298
00:17:50,795 --> 00:17:52,561
You're not planning to die, aren't you?

299
00:17:52,904 --> 00:17:54,725
But why?!

300
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,327
Is it because your master ordered you?

301
00:17:58,327 --> 00:18:00,373
That's why, right?

302
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:02,529
Answer me!

303
00:18:04,873 --> 00:18:09,130
They said Clayman's notorious for treating
his minions like disposable fodder.

304
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:10,264
Could it be--

305
00:18:10,289 --> 00:18:12,428
Silent! If you say any more than that--

306
00:18:12,453 --> 00:18:14,385
I see, so that's the case.

307
00:18:14,385 --> 00:18:16,967
If you're prepared to die
just to follow his order, then--

308
00:18:16,992 --> 00:18:18,404
About that...

309
00:18:19,682 --> 00:18:21,100
Tell me more.

310
00:18:21,864 --> 00:18:22,872
Youm...

311
00:18:23,561 --> 00:18:24,654
Mjurran.

312
00:18:24,679 --> 00:18:26,939
If you got something going on
then tell me.

313
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:28,107
I will protect you.

314
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:29,650
Are you stupid?

315
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:31,927
Can't you understand judging
from my look right now?

316
00:18:31,952 --> 00:18:33,404
I'm a Majin!

317
00:18:33,404 --> 00:18:35,489
So what about that?

318
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:40,334
Your race has nothing to do
with how you are as a person.

319
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:45,374
I had that hard time learning
the ruler of this country is a slime.

320
00:18:47,881 --> 00:18:50,162
I love you, Mjurran.

321
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:56,404
Isn't it normal to want to protect
the person you love?

322
00:18:59,115 --> 00:19:04,115
What you have seen of me is nothing
but an act I put on to fool you!

323
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:07,162
The person you fell for
doesn't actually exist!

324
00:19:07,545 --> 00:19:09,006
Rest assured, Mjurran.

325
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:19,170
I will keep on getting fooled
by you until I die.

326
00:19:21,661 --> 00:19:25,581
If I believe in you until the end,
then it's undoubtedly a "truth" for me.

327
00:19:30,342 --> 00:19:31,504
Let go of me.

328
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:32,647
Oh, sorry about that.

329
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:35,428
Why are you taking the advantage
of the situation and hug her?

330
00:19:35,453 --> 00:19:38,094
Oh, well, I thought it would
be fine given the mood and all.

331
00:19:38,094 --> 00:19:39,678
"Fine" my ass!

332
00:19:39,703 --> 00:19:41,781
Hey, this has nothing to
do with you anyway!

333
00:19:41,806 --> 00:19:44,850
You're always trying to get a
leg on me every single time!

334
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:47,269
Thank you... Youm.

335
00:20:13,247 --> 00:20:14,380
Mjurran!

336
00:20:25,808 --> 00:20:27,059
Mjurran!

337
00:20:35,109 --> 00:20:38,820
If it's to protect you...

338
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:48,622
Then I...

339
00:20:58,841 --> 00:21:00,492
Prison Field!

340
00:21:12,453 --> 00:21:13,814
Two barriers?

341
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:15,250
And this is...?

342
00:21:17,469 --> 00:21:19,086
W-What's wrong?

343
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:21,655
I can't connect to Great Rimuru.

344
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:23,908
Something is interfering
with our communication.

345
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:26,766
Great Rimuru...

346
00:21:30,805 --> 00:21:32,374
What's wrong?

347
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:35,649
You sure are not as good
as you claimed to be.

348
00:21:36,587 --> 00:21:38,906
You got annoying moves, I must say.

349
00:21:43,511 --> 00:21:44,720
What...

350
00:21:45,888 --> 00:21:48,432
I can't feel any strength
in my body...

351
00:21:52,164 --> 00:21:54,352
What's wrong, Miss?

352
00:21:55,481 --> 00:21:57,867
You look like in pain to me.

353
00:22:14,124 --> 00:22:17,503
I'm used to losing things

354
00:22:17,503 --> 00:22:22,174
I said it like it's someone else's problem

355
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:26,053
It's a blurry realism

356
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:31,100
Because it's not about me

357
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:36,188
The nameless sadness disappears,
warped in a legato-like dream

358
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:40,359
Will we feel better if we hug each other?

359
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:44,613
The life which I repeat is a joined miracle

360
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:49,159
Don't forget me, pass your voice to me

361
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:56,792
If I were to live for someone's sake

362
00:22:56,792 --> 00:23:01,088
I wish that someone is you
(I'll tell you one more story)

363
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:05,426
If I can redo this world once again

364
00:23:05,426 --> 00:23:10,806
I will paint that story with love

365
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:15,060
You'll know how this story's gonna end

366
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:16,979
I will tell you

367
00:23:16,979 --> 00:23:19,356
I will tell you one more story

368
00:23:19,356 --> 00:23:23,652
You'll know how this story's gonna end

369
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:25,863
I will tell you

370
00:23:37,055 --> 00:23:40,377
Next Time, Beauty in Action
