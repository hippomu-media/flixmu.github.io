1
00:00:01,688 --> 00:00:04,594
The embassy from Animal
Kingdom of Eurazania sent

2
00:00:04,619 --> 00:00:08,047
by the Demon Lord Carrion
has arrived in Tempest.

3
00:00:08,634 --> 00:00:12,321
But, a lot happened right
after they arrived...

4
00:00:24,798 --> 00:00:27,157
...and it ended up like this.

5
00:00:28,728 --> 00:00:33,650
Well, it's partly my fault, to be honest.

6
00:00:53,424 --> 00:00:58,387
Let's give a name to a nameless flower

7
00:00:58,387 --> 00:01:03,392
So that it won't freeze
from the coldness of solitude

8
00:01:03,392 --> 00:01:08,147
If it's as frail as it is beautiful

9
00:01:08,147 --> 00:01:11,066
Then it's not as fragile anymore

10
00:01:12,651 --> 00:01:17,531
Like how you paint color
on a transparent body

11
00:01:17,531 --> 00:01:20,576
Beyond the page of the chapter

12
00:01:20,576 --> 00:01:23,287
It's welcoming you with a smile

13
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:27,708
Whenever, as much as it takes

14
00:01:27,708 --> 00:01:30,711
Let's start a new world

15
00:01:30,711 --> 00:01:34,506
We're Storyteller

16
00:01:34,506 --> 00:01:38,636
All the love, hope, envy

17
00:01:38,636 --> 00:01:40,554
Even the song of despair we sing today

18
00:01:40,554 --> 00:01:44,600
It will all be a seed and bloom,
into a strong person

19
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:50,606
Why does salvation
born from someone's tear

20
00:01:50,606 --> 00:01:55,903
That's just sad

21
00:01:55,903 --> 00:02:02,743
Ideal and fantasy,
all mixed up by youthful impulse

22
00:02:02,743 --> 00:02:09,500
My real self, is now reborn!

23
00:02:10,954 --> 00:02:15,235
(Episode 26: The Trades with
the Animal Kingdom)

24
00:02:26,337 --> 00:02:28,626
Is that all of Kijin's power?

25
00:02:28,651 --> 00:02:31,025
Entertain me more!

26
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:32,938
That's my intention!

27
00:02:40,032 --> 00:02:41,509
Prepare yourself!

28
00:02:43,735 --> 00:02:44,610
That is?!

29
00:02:45,079 --> 00:02:46,790
A giant Magic Shot?!

30
00:02:46,815 --> 00:02:49,282
Hey, Shion! Wait!

31
00:02:49,307 --> 00:02:51,603
Are you planning to blow
this whole area away?!

32
00:02:52,985 --> 00:02:55,064
Crap, she's not listening.

33
00:02:55,089 --> 00:02:57,391
Oh, nice! Come at me!

34
00:02:57,416 --> 00:03:00,555
That Suphia girl seems to be
excited to take it straight on,

35
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:03,680
but not even she would make
it out unscratched against that!

36
00:03:04,587 --> 00:03:06,384
What should I do?
Should I stop them?

37
00:03:08,401 --> 00:03:09,477
Take this--

38
00:03:09,502 --> 00:03:10,782
That's it!

39
00:03:15,446 --> 00:03:17,275
It should be enough.

40
00:03:21,564 --> 00:03:23,337
"Beast Transformation," huh...

41
00:03:24,267 --> 00:03:26,064
Let's end it here.

42
00:03:27,664 --> 00:03:30,984
So, did we pass?

43
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,321
Yes.

44
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:34,454
Then it's over.

45
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,681
M-Mister, what does that mean?

46
00:03:37,931 --> 00:03:40,978
Seems like they were testing us.

47
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:44,876
We have no complaint.
You guys are pretty strong.

48
00:03:44,901 --> 00:03:48,259
You all have the right to stand
on equal footing against us.

49
00:03:48,284 --> 00:03:50,040
You guys have convinced me of that.

50
00:03:50,509 --> 00:03:55,641
I hereby declare that we will now treat
the ruler of Jura Tempest Kingdom,

51
00:03:55,666 --> 00:03:58,274
Rimuru Tempest and his friends
on the same level as Great Carrion.

52
00:03:58,299 --> 00:03:59,157
You got it?

53
00:03:59,182 --> 00:03:59,946
Yes, ma'am!

54
00:03:59,971 --> 00:04:01,829
Like what Lady Suphia just said.

55
00:04:01,854 --> 00:04:05,337
It's rare to meet a human like you
who could fight one on one against me.

56
00:04:06,513 --> 00:04:07,841
It's my honor.

57
00:04:11,779 --> 00:04:14,716
I was worried what would happen
right off the bat, but...

58
00:04:14,741 --> 00:04:16,974
Good thing it all ended well.

59
00:04:16,999 --> 00:04:19,575
Shion, you understand right?

60
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:21,529
Shion?

61
00:04:22,505 --> 00:04:23,786
Well...

62
00:04:23,811 --> 00:04:25,567
What should I do about this?

63
00:04:25,592 --> 00:04:27,676
What?! It's about to explode?!

64
00:04:27,701 --> 00:04:29,317
Can't you shut it off?

65
00:04:29,342 --> 00:04:32,575
I can't! I'm at my limit already!

66
00:04:35,255 --> 00:04:36,934
Great Rimuru, please evacuate.

67
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:38,313
C-Calm down!

68
00:04:38,338 --> 00:04:41,769
Slowly, try to slowly
point that upward, okay?

69
00:04:41,794 --> 00:04:43,497
U-Upward..?

70
00:04:44,372 --> 00:04:46,653
Spirit! Push it with your spirit!

71
00:04:47,302 --> 00:04:49,160
I don't think I can do it!

72
00:04:49,255 --> 00:04:52,309
Oh well, that's Shion for you.

73
00:04:57,474 --> 00:04:59,255
Shion, shoot it.

74
00:04:59,763 --> 00:05:01,021
It's gonna be okay.

75
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,153
But...

76
00:05:03,349 --> 00:05:04,763
Believe in me!

77
00:05:06,013 --> 00:05:08,075
Okay! Here I go!

78
00:05:12,153 --> 00:05:13,536
Gluttony!

79
00:05:23,716 --> 00:05:25,427
There, it's over.

80
00:05:28,208 --> 00:05:29,352
Impressive.

81
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:31,036
Seriously?!

82
00:05:33,171 --> 00:05:36,382
It is to be expected from My Master.

83
00:05:39,208 --> 00:05:40,950
Are you okay?

84
00:05:41,794 --> 00:05:44,637
As expected from the man
acknowledged by Great Carrion.

85
00:05:45,818 --> 00:05:49,646
It's a blessing to be able to
form a bond with you and your country.

86
00:05:49,646 --> 00:05:51,022
Same goes for us.

87
00:05:51,022 --> 00:05:52,927
Welcome to Tempest.

88
00:05:54,443 --> 00:05:59,357
And thus, we welcomed
the envoy from Eurazania.

89
00:06:02,607 --> 00:06:04,160
That night.

90
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:09,318
We held a modest welcome party
in the newly built Guest House.

91
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:16,786
This is great.

92
00:06:16,811 --> 00:06:18,677
It's seasoned perfectly.

93
00:06:18,702 --> 00:06:20,278
It got the right amount of salt.

94
00:06:20,591 --> 00:06:22,387
I can eat these all day!

95
00:06:22,387 --> 00:06:23,411
Delicious!

96
00:06:31,716 --> 00:06:32,997
What a bliss.

97
00:06:33,301 --> 00:06:34,653
She sure drinks a lot.

98
00:06:34,678 --> 00:06:38,051
Just who the heck gave
her an entire barrel?

99
00:06:38,263 --> 00:06:40,013
Meanwhile...

100
00:06:45,778 --> 00:06:49,739
Is it okay for you guys to
show others that form?

101
00:06:49,903 --> 00:06:52,536
It's not like it's a secret or anything.

102
00:06:52,561 --> 00:06:54,107
I-I see...

103
00:06:54,169 --> 00:06:55,357
But still...

104
00:06:55,482 --> 00:06:59,013
We only show this form in
front of people we trust.

105
00:06:59,114 --> 00:07:00,372
I see.

106
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:01,934
Oh well.

107
00:07:02,161 --> 00:07:04,153
But still...

108
00:07:05,318 --> 00:07:09,255
To think you would drink this
much of our apple brandy.

109
00:07:09,411 --> 00:07:10,778
"This much"?

110
00:07:11,114 --> 00:07:13,013
You don't make a lot of these?

111
00:07:13,388 --> 00:07:15,989
Ah, sorry. Please, don't mind it.

112
00:07:16,114 --> 00:07:19,305
We made those for the guests, after all.

113
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:23,657
But we rely on what the forest has
for us, so we couldn't make much of it.

114
00:07:25,536 --> 00:07:27,724
Then I have a nice idea.

115
00:07:29,614 --> 00:07:32,989
We have plenty of fruits
in Eurazania.

116
00:07:33,137 --> 00:07:35,692
I'll have our men to deliver
some of it to you.

117
00:07:35,982 --> 00:07:37,818
Really? Are you sure?

118
00:07:37,843 --> 00:07:38,802
Yes.

119
00:07:38,963 --> 00:07:41,341
Isn't that great, Great Rimuru?

120
00:07:41,366 --> 00:07:42,450
Yeah!

121
00:07:47,443 --> 00:07:48,794
I see.

122
00:07:48,982 --> 00:07:52,278
So they want us to pass
some of the goods to them.

123
00:07:53,903 --> 00:07:55,169
How about the rates?

124
00:07:55,505 --> 00:07:57,575
I'll leave the details up to you.

125
00:07:57,685 --> 00:08:00,247
I'm fine with anything as long as
I get to drink nice things.

126
00:08:00,272 --> 00:08:04,447
Fruits from Eurazania are of a high quality,
so you can some expect good stuff.

127
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:11,239
So they want us to work
on the numbers ourselves.

128
00:08:11,301 --> 00:08:15,410
What would be the right rate
for exchange of goods?

129
00:08:18,427 --> 00:08:20,871
Oh well, let's leave it to
the professional.

130
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:21,974
Shuna.

131
00:08:22,099 --> 00:08:23,669
What is it, Great Rimuru?

132
00:08:23,966 --> 00:08:25,153
Call Koby for me.

133
00:08:28,679 --> 00:08:30,789
He's a Kobold merchant.
(Kobold merchant - Koby)

134
00:08:30,814 --> 00:08:35,548
He opens a shop here in Tempest and is
currently handling the merchant affairs here.

135
00:08:35,669 --> 00:08:38,286
G-Great Rimuru, what do you need me for?

136
00:08:38,311 --> 00:08:41,083
He's Koby, our merchants representative.

137
00:08:41,169 --> 00:08:43,782
He used to do trades in
Demon Lord domain.

138
00:08:43,807 --> 00:08:45,985
I'm appointing him to work
on the deals with you guys.

139
00:08:46,864 --> 00:08:49,138
These two are the envoy
from the Animal Kingdom.

140
00:08:49,333 --> 00:08:52,602
Please bring up stuff other than alcohol
that they might be interested in.

141
00:08:52,627 --> 00:08:56,207
B-But the people of weak race are
not allowed to enter the Animal Kingdom--

142
00:08:57,263 --> 00:08:59,833
I'll issue you a permit pass,
so feel free to come in.

143
00:08:59,858 --> 00:09:02,505
I will also talk to Great Carrion
about you.

144
00:09:02,530 --> 00:09:06,068
You look like a beastman anyway,
so I bet you will get along with them.

145
00:09:07,974 --> 00:09:09,794
Anyway, I'm leaving it to you.

146
00:09:10,778 --> 00:09:12,684
Well... ermm...

147
00:09:13,208 --> 00:09:13,911
Okay.

148
00:09:15,482 --> 00:09:18,825
I'll leave the rest to you young'uns.

149
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:20,435
Please excuse us.

150
00:09:22,653 --> 00:09:24,177
Wha-, wait...

151
00:09:25,747 --> 00:09:27,591
Great Rimuru!

152
00:09:29,786 --> 00:09:32,349
Koby should be able to do it well.

153
00:09:32,374 --> 00:09:34,245
Yes, you're right.

154
00:09:34,245 --> 00:09:38,997
These kinds of stuff surprisingly go
smoothly with alcohol on the table.

155
00:09:40,388 --> 00:09:43,677
And so, we all enjoyed
the party all night.

156
00:09:44,411 --> 00:09:48,443
Things seem to go off smoothly for
our first formal meeting with another country.

157
00:09:52,638 --> 00:09:54,036
Several days later.

158
00:09:54,061 --> 00:09:57,919
Albis and Suphia returned to Eurazania.

159
00:10:00,224 --> 00:10:02,653
We agreed to expand our
technology exchange.

160
00:10:02,747 --> 00:10:07,286
These people remained in Tempest
to learn about our technology.

161
00:10:08,849 --> 00:10:11,013
They're a diligent and kind bunch.

162
00:10:15,849 --> 00:10:19,747
Just how does hot water come
out from this "faucet" thingy?

163
00:10:20,114 --> 00:10:22,364
It doesn't look like it gets
boiled elsewhere.

164
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:24,552
It's Rune magic.

165
00:10:24,577 --> 00:10:26,068
Rune magic?

166
00:10:26,093 --> 00:10:27,466
Where did you put the Rune?

167
00:10:29,614 --> 00:10:35,130
We engraved a Rune with heat magic
on the faucet handle.

168
00:10:35,552 --> 00:10:36,810
I see.

169
00:10:36,835 --> 00:10:40,585
So it will heat the water
when someone with magic turns it.

170
00:10:40,801 --> 00:10:42,785
As expected from a Dwarf craftsman.

171
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:45,747
Well, this is nothing much.

172
00:10:46,005 --> 00:10:48,849
It came from Mr.Rimuru's idea, after all.

173
00:10:48,943 --> 00:10:50,481
(To be precise, it's Great Sage's idea.)

174
00:10:52,888 --> 00:10:56,239
You're not going to look around
like the other guys?

175
00:10:56,598 --> 00:10:58,098
It's not my duty.

176
00:10:58,139 --> 00:11:00,848
The "Panther Fang" Phobio is
under a house arrest now,

177
00:11:00,873 --> 00:11:04,168
and he told me to do something
useful for Lord Rimuru.

178
00:11:04,168 --> 00:11:06,963
So that's why you join the town
security, huh?

179
00:11:06,963 --> 00:11:08,606
Indeed so.

180
00:11:08,631 --> 00:11:10,130
Grucius!

181
00:11:10,521 --> 00:11:12,208
It's time for patrol.

182
00:11:12,233 --> 00:11:13,169
Okay!

183
00:11:13,497 --> 00:11:14,318
See you.

184
00:11:17,849 --> 00:11:20,232
I guess I'll go take a bath
or something.

185
00:11:21,989 --> 00:11:25,022
You got a sword training to do.

186
00:11:25,022 --> 00:11:25,989
Yes.

187
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,810
As for fractional division,

188
00:11:33,835 --> 00:11:36,286
it's a bit hard to calculate it
as it is,

189
00:11:36,311 --> 00:11:38,888
so lets try to turn it into multiplication
and start from there.

190
00:11:39,388 --> 00:11:41,771
To turn division into multiplication...

191
00:11:41,796 --> 00:11:44,677
They're taking the class properly
even without me.

192
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:56,286
And then, more days passed.

193
00:11:56,700 --> 00:12:00,841
Youm and his gang resume
their journey as a Champion.

194
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:05,427
And on the same day, Benimaru and
the rest of the embassy returned.

195
00:12:07,255 --> 00:12:10,435
The Eurazania knights were as expected.

196
00:12:10,513 --> 00:12:15,357
Each of them received proper training
from the Demon Lord Carrion himself.

197
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:18,552
To be expected from a Beastmaster, I guess.

198
00:12:19,021 --> 00:12:20,060
Anything else?

199
00:12:20,085 --> 00:12:21,005
Yes.

200
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:24,786
Their architecture is not much
compared to the one in Tempest.

201
00:12:25,185 --> 00:12:27,817
However, their royal palace was
stuffed with luxuries

202
00:12:27,842 --> 00:12:30,302
showing their remarkable
obsession with wealth concentration.

203
00:12:32,427 --> 00:12:36,685
Riguru is doing so great!

204
00:12:37,872 --> 00:12:39,489
Well, anyway...

205
00:12:40,052 --> 00:12:42,247
However, it was not a bad thing
for them.

206
00:12:42,272 --> 00:12:44,177
The residents actually wished for it.

207
00:12:44,202 --> 00:12:45,452
I see.

208
00:12:45,477 --> 00:12:50,507
Our architecture and crafts are on
a level above theirs.

209
00:12:50,532 --> 00:12:54,710
In addition to Kaijin, we got Kurobei
and Shuna after all.

210
00:12:55,818 --> 00:12:59,958
However, they have one thing that
is worth paying attention to.

211
00:12:59,983 --> 00:13:01,107
And that is?

212
00:13:01,169 --> 00:13:02,333
Their agriculture.

213
00:13:02,857 --> 00:13:03,818
Oho!

214
00:13:04,489 --> 00:13:08,521
They possess big fields that are
bigger than our whole country

215
00:13:08,546 --> 00:13:11,452
and it's filled with colorful corps.

216
00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:15,325
Can we learn anything from them?

217
00:13:17,489 --> 00:13:19,091
I believe it's possible.

218
00:13:19,286 --> 00:13:20,310
Great!

219
00:13:20,335 --> 00:13:24,185
We will have the next embassy
to focus on their agriculture.

220
00:13:24,435 --> 00:13:28,312
The food situation in our country
has improved a lot,

221
00:13:28,312 --> 00:13:31,841
however, we still have a lot
of trails and errors to go through.

222
00:13:31,974 --> 00:13:36,365
As such, this might lead to further
improvement on the situation--

223
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:40,278
Riguru is so--

224
00:13:40,303 --> 00:13:43,474
Well then, I got to prepare for the trip
to the Dwarf kingdom.

225
00:13:43,499 --> 00:13:45,146
So I'll leave the rest to you guys.

226
00:13:45,364 --> 00:13:46,396
I'm counting on you.

227
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,482
Yes, sir!

228
00:13:52,888 --> 00:13:53,880
Great Rimuru.

229
00:13:57,942 --> 00:14:04,262
If it is possible, could you appoint Riguru
as the head of the next embassy?

230
00:14:04,685 --> 00:14:06,153
What do you mean?

231
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:09,989
I believe Demon Lord Carrion
is a man worthy of our trust.

232
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:13,263
They won't treat our emissary
in a rough manner.

233
00:14:13,669 --> 00:14:17,770
Thus, it should be wise for me to
stay here and protect the country instead.

234
00:14:18,075 --> 00:14:19,044
I see.

235
00:14:19,069 --> 00:14:23,966
So you're saying that it should
be okay to leave the rest to Riguru, right?

236
00:14:23,991 --> 00:14:24,974
Yes.

237
00:14:25,216 --> 00:14:26,888
Got it. Then it's done.

238
00:14:27,083 --> 00:14:28,294
Thank you very much.

239
00:14:30,935 --> 00:14:33,966
But to think that you would
trust him this much.

240
00:14:33,991 --> 00:14:37,137
Carrion must be a great king,
beyond his prowess.

241
00:14:37,162 --> 00:14:38,543
Indeed.

242
00:14:38,661 --> 00:14:42,653
The truth is, I tried to pick a fight
with him, but he laughed it off.

243
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:47,114
Wait, what did you...?

244
00:14:48,076 --> 00:14:52,372
I couldn't use big moves like Hell Flare,
so they took me down pretty easily.

245
00:14:53,068 --> 00:14:54,715
I still have long to go.

246
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:55,833
Oh my...

247
00:14:55,858 --> 00:14:58,607
Ah, but I won against Phobio.

248
00:14:58,723 --> 00:15:00,114
I see...

249
00:15:00,139 --> 00:15:03,607
Well, it sure is amazing that
you won against Phobio...

250
00:15:04,864 --> 00:15:09,278
No good. As I thought, it was
wrong to let this guy go outside.

251
00:15:11,005 --> 00:15:12,896
So after this and that...

252
00:15:14,364 --> 00:15:15,708
The following day.

253
00:15:15,794 --> 00:15:19,505
This time, I departed to Dwargon.

254
00:15:20,497 --> 00:15:22,450
Hey, Ranga! Too fast!

255
00:15:22,475 --> 00:15:24,294
Yes! Understood!

256
00:15:26,216 --> 00:15:28,497
Ranga!

257
00:15:29,767 --> 00:15:35,325
This time, we got Gobuta, Gobuzo, and
all six of Goblin Rider to accompany us.

258
00:15:35,521 --> 00:15:36,778
Shuna and Shion.

259
00:15:37,357 --> 00:15:42,607
And then, Kaijin, and Garm, Dord, and Myrd,
the three Dwarf brothers.

260
00:15:43,177 --> 00:15:48,452
We're happy to be given the opportunity to go
and relax in Dwargon after such a long time.

261
00:15:48,452 --> 00:15:51,271
It's true. You guys think so too, right?

262
00:15:51,296 --> 00:15:52,794
Indeed!

263
00:15:54,372 --> 00:15:57,364
I'm happy that you guys feel like that.

264
00:15:57,389 --> 00:16:01,028
Our country got this far thanks
to you guys, after all.

265
00:16:01,778 --> 00:16:05,880
As a craftsman, it's really
a wonderful word to hear.

266
00:16:05,905 --> 00:16:06,778
Yeah.

267
00:16:06,943 --> 00:16:09,864
We're really lucky to meet you guys.

268
00:16:10,083 --> 00:16:11,458
Mister!

269
00:16:14,693 --> 00:16:19,489
By the way, we got the presents for King
Gazel packed on the two carriages behind us.

270
00:16:19,622 --> 00:16:24,321
It would've been much easier to just
pack it all inside my stomach, but...

271
00:16:24,321 --> 00:16:27,032
The modus is also important
in such occasion.

272
00:16:27,032 --> 00:16:28,537
She scolded me.

273
00:16:29,521 --> 00:16:31,370
As expected from the Ogre princess.

274
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:36,458
She learned stuff from Vesta recently,
and is now quite knowledgeable in manners.

275
00:16:36,951 --> 00:16:42,826
By the way, it would've much better
to leave Shuna behind, but...

276
00:16:43,966 --> 00:16:46,457
Princess Shuna and Great Rimuru
will go on a trip together?

277
00:16:46,638 --> 00:16:48,958
No, it's not a trip. It's for a job.

278
00:16:48,983 --> 00:16:50,818
That's unfair! Unfair!

279
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:52,927
It's unfair that only Princess Shuna
gets to play with Great Rimuru--

280
00:16:52,952 --> 00:16:54,857
A job, okay? It's a job...

281
00:16:58,497 --> 00:17:00,364
Ms.Shion is mad!

282
00:17:00,389 --> 00:17:02,044
Please calm down!

283
00:17:03,505 --> 00:17:06,685
Well, she would cry, scream,
and rage and all...

284
00:17:10,106 --> 00:17:12,435
So, can I leave her in your care, Rigurd?

285
00:17:13,410 --> 00:17:15,582
T-This is nothing...

286
00:17:15,817 --> 00:17:20,700
I'm worried about Rigurd and others if
I left Shion behind, so I took her with me.

287
00:17:21,474 --> 00:17:25,435
Well, she got the looks of a skilled secretary
as long as she keeps her mouth shut.

288
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:28,872
Everything should go well
if I keep watching on her.

289
00:17:30,333 --> 00:17:32,169
Great Rimuru, look.

290
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:37,853
The road that got destroyed
during the battle with Charybdis

291
00:17:37,853 --> 00:17:39,802
has been mostly fixed.

292
00:17:39,827 --> 00:17:42,482
You're right. They sure work fast.

293
00:17:42,507 --> 00:17:44,599
As expected from the Orcs.

294
00:17:52,388 --> 00:17:54,044
Right according to the plan.

295
00:17:54,122 --> 00:17:57,794
Sir Geld, we need more cobblestone.

296
00:17:58,021 --> 00:17:59,060
Got it.

297
00:17:59,085 --> 00:18:00,888
I'll contact the people
at the quarry later.

298
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:01,794
Thank you.

299
00:18:02,536 --> 00:18:03,614
That is...?

300
00:18:09,489 --> 00:18:12,346
So today's the day of your departure
to the Dwarf kingdom?

301
00:18:12,346 --> 00:18:13,278
Yeah.

302
00:18:13,303 --> 00:18:16,771
You guys fixed the road,
so it's been a nice ride for us.

303
00:18:16,796 --> 00:18:17,575
Thank you.

304
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,872
We worked on the road from
the Dwarf kingdom area.

305
00:18:20,897 --> 00:18:23,974
So everything from here on
is a completed street.

306
00:18:24,858 --> 00:18:26,943
Looks like it will just gets
better for us.

307
00:18:26,968 --> 00:18:28,419
Good job.

308
00:18:28,818 --> 00:18:30,122
Thank you very much.

309
00:18:30,341 --> 00:18:31,310
So.

310
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:37,708
This is...?

311
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:38,911
A beer.

312
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:40,833
Beer?!

313
00:18:41,411 --> 00:18:43,333
Don't drink too much, okay?

314
00:18:43,358 --> 00:18:44,333
Yes, sir!

315
00:18:45,419 --> 00:18:48,075
And so, the trip went smoothly.

316
00:18:48,778 --> 00:18:50,638
Four days after the departure.

317
00:18:50,934 --> 00:18:54,090
We arrived in the Armed Nation of Dwargon.

318
00:18:54,676 --> 00:18:56,169
Open the gate!

319
00:18:56,194 --> 00:19:00,395
They've got such imposing demon beasts,
are they someone important?

320
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:03,021
Are those even a demon beasts?
I've never seen it.

321
00:19:03,021 --> 00:19:05,409
Their carriages seem to be made
with unique technology.

322
00:19:06,126 --> 00:19:07,806
Hey, Brother.

323
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:10,564
Looks like you're doing well.

324
00:19:10,589 --> 00:19:11,826
Kaido!

325
00:19:11,851 --> 00:19:13,834
Long time no see!
How are you doing?

326
00:19:13,859 --> 00:19:16,615
I'm having fun working for Mister Rimuru.

327
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:17,826
I bet so.

328
00:19:17,851 --> 00:19:19,685
I can tell just by looking.

329
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:21,513
How about you guys?

330
00:19:21,538 --> 00:19:23,056
Thanks to you.

331
00:19:23,081 --> 00:19:23,900
Yeah.

332
00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:25,837
So.

333
00:19:26,322 --> 00:19:27,822
Where's Mr.Rimuru?

334
00:19:29,642 --> 00:19:32,439
He's the state guest, after all.

335
00:19:32,464 --> 00:19:34,798
I better greet him first.

336
00:19:35,017 --> 00:19:37,923
What is he talking about?
I'm here...

337
00:19:38,041 --> 00:19:39,908
Ah, I see.

338
00:19:39,933 --> 00:19:42,369
He only knew me in my slime form.

339
00:19:43,245 --> 00:19:45,175
This is him.

340
00:19:46,659 --> 00:19:48,347
This is him.

341
00:19:49,433 --> 00:19:50,534
Him.

342
00:19:53,908 --> 00:19:55,798
Well, a lot happened.

343
00:19:56,853 --> 00:20:00,720
Mr.Rimuru... I'm glad that
you're doing well...

344
00:20:00,745 --> 00:20:03,783
Ermm... well, please, over here.

345
00:20:03,876 --> 00:20:06,087
Well, that's to be expected.

346
00:20:07,587 --> 00:20:11,345
And so, we safely get into Dwargon

347
00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:15,447
and are now heading to meet King Gazel.

348
00:20:17,767 --> 00:20:20,666
I'm glad that you're doing well,
Mr.Rimuru.

349
00:20:21,048 --> 00:20:23,119
Same goes to you, Mr.Dorf.

350
00:20:24,916 --> 00:20:26,892
You can drop the formalities with me.

351
00:20:27,166 --> 00:20:28,072
Well then.

352
00:20:28,097 --> 00:20:29,939
Our king is waiting for you.

353
00:20:30,439 --> 00:20:34,988
He's Dorf, the Leader of the Pegasus Knights
who assisted us during the fight with Charybdis.

354
00:20:34,988 --> 00:20:38,237
Pegasus Knights are the king's
top-secret unit,

355
00:20:38,262 --> 00:20:41,479
so he usually disguises himself
as a civil servant like this.

356
00:20:45,593 --> 00:20:50,978
The ruler of Jura Tempest Federation,
Rimuru Majesty has arrived!

357
00:20:57,892 --> 00:20:59,236
Please, come in.

358
00:21:05,999 --> 00:21:10,697
The king of the Armed Nation of Dwargon,
Gazel Dwargon.

359
00:21:11,767 --> 00:21:14,298
Long time no see, Rimuru.

360
00:21:21,592 --> 00:21:23,303
I see.

361
00:21:26,334 --> 00:21:27,932
Thanks for the work.

362
00:21:27,933 --> 00:21:30,561
It was a very intriguing report.

363
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:32,006
Thank you.

364
00:21:32,944 --> 00:21:38,067
I don't mind returning your
heart at this point.

365
00:21:40,225 --> 00:21:45,693
But it would be great if you could do
one more work for us.

366
00:21:46,944 --> 00:21:49,115
What do you need me to do?

367
00:21:49,225 --> 00:21:50,342
Great Clayman.

368
00:21:50,382 --> 00:21:52,781
It's nothing big.

369
00:21:53,225 --> 00:21:56,905
It's a very simple thing, in fact.

370
00:21:57,967 --> 00:21:59,615
Mjurran.

371
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:14,479
I'm used to losing things

372
00:22:14,479 --> 00:22:19,150
I said it like it's someone else's problem

373
00:22:19,859 --> 00:22:23,029
It's a blurry realism

374
00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:28,077
Because it's not about me

375
00:22:28,077 --> 00:22:33,165
The nameless sadness disappears,
warped in a legato-like dream

376
00:22:33,164 --> 00:22:37,335
Will we feel better if we hug each other?

377
00:22:37,336 --> 00:22:41,590
The life which I repeat is a joined miracle

378
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:46,136
Don't forget me, pass your voice to me

379
00:22:50,015 --> 00:22:53,769
If I were to live for someone's sake

380
00:22:53,768 --> 00:22:58,064
I wish that someone is you
(I'll tell you one more story)

381
00:22:58,064 --> 00:23:02,402
If I can redo this world once again

382
00:23:02,402 --> 00:23:07,782
I will paint that story with love

383
00:23:07,782 --> 00:23:12,036
You'll know how this story's gonna end

384
00:23:12,036 --> 00:23:13,955
I will tell you

385
00:23:13,955 --> 00:23:16,332
I will tell you one more story

386
00:23:16,332 --> 00:23:20,628
You'll know how this story's gonna end

387
00:23:20,629 --> 00:23:22,840
I will tell you

388
00:23:33,434 --> 00:23:37,479
Next time,
"Heaven, Once Again."
