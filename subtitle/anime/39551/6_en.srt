1
00:00:14,304 --> 00:00:19,267
Let's give a name to a nameless flower

2
00:00:19,267 --> 00:00:24,272
So that it won't freeze
from the coldness of solitude

3
00:00:24,272 --> 00:00:29,027
If it's as frail as it is beautiful

4
00:00:29,027 --> 00:00:31,946
Then it's not as fragile anymore

5
00:00:33,531 --> 00:00:38,411
Like how you paint color
on a transparent body

6
00:00:38,411 --> 00:00:41,456
Beyond the page of the chapter

7
00:00:41,456 --> 00:00:44,167
It's welcoming you with a smile

8
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:48,588
Whenever, as much as it takes

9
00:00:48,588 --> 00:00:51,591
Let's start a new world

10
00:00:51,591 --> 00:00:55,386
We're Storyteller

11
00:00:55,386 --> 00:00:59,516
All the love, hope, envy

12
00:00:59,516 --> 00:01:01,434
Even the song of despair we sing today

13
00:01:01,434 --> 00:01:05,480
It will all be a seed and bloom,
into a strong person

14
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:11,486
Why does salvation
born from someone's tear

15
00:01:11,486 --> 00:01:16,783
That's just sad

16
00:01:16,783 --> 00:01:23,623
Ideal and fantasy,
all mixed up by youthful impulse

17
00:01:23,623 --> 00:01:30,380
My real self, is now reborn!

18
00:01:31,539 --> 00:01:35,382
(Episode 30: Beauty in Action)

19
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:39,349
Sensei!

20
00:01:46,609 --> 00:01:49,304
C'mon, you're such a crybaby, Chloe.

21
00:01:49,329 --> 00:01:50,484
Don't cry like that!

22
00:01:50,625 --> 00:01:52,117
But you too, Ken.

23
00:01:52,142 --> 00:01:54,239
I'm just sweating through my eyes!

24
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:55,359
Sensei!

25
00:01:55,977 --> 00:01:57,023
Sensei!

26
00:02:00,938 --> 00:02:02,180
Chloe.

27
00:02:02,859 --> 00:02:04,508
You're a good girl, Chloe.

28
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:06,938
I will give you this, so cheer up okay?

29
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:10,359
I want that too!

30
00:02:11,398 --> 00:02:12,781
I got it.

31
00:02:12,806 --> 00:02:14,430
How nice!

32
00:02:14,455 --> 00:02:16,000
It's unfair!

33
00:02:16,025 --> 00:02:18,492
Oh yeah, I also have a gift for you guys.

34
00:02:24,766 --> 00:02:26,344
You look cool, Ken.

35
00:02:26,369 --> 00:02:28,031
Same goes for you.

36
00:02:28,056 --> 00:02:29,703
This is wonderful!

37
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:31,984
So cute!

38
00:02:32,367 --> 00:02:35,364
I have this skilled girl named Shuna
back in my country.

39
00:02:35,364 --> 00:02:37,359
I had her make those and
send them over here.

40
00:02:37,523 --> 00:02:38,586
Sensei...

41
00:02:38,611 --> 00:02:39,750
Thank you.

42
00:02:39,914 --> 00:02:42,719
Study well, okay?

43
00:02:43,172 --> 00:02:46,734
Farewell is painful, but it's not
like we won't see each other again.

44
00:02:47,578 --> 00:02:49,750
I will come to visit with Ranga later.

45
00:02:50,523 --> 00:02:53,867
You kids better study properly
even without us, okay?

46
00:02:53,892 --> 00:02:56,648
P-Promise that you will come
for a visit, okay?

47
00:02:56,673 --> 00:03:01,187
A-After we graduate, we won't mind
visiting you instead.

48
00:03:01,212 --> 00:03:02,891
Yeah, I will be waiting.

49
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:06,352
The Central City of Rimuru will hold
a big festival to welcome you guys.

50
00:03:11,406 --> 00:03:12,257
Sensei!

51
00:03:12,282 --> 00:03:13,352
See you again!

52
00:03:13,377 --> 00:03:14,977
- Good bye!
- Be careful!

53
00:03:15,828 --> 00:03:17,953
Do well, okay!

54
00:03:23,633 --> 00:03:24,664
See you again.

55
00:03:29,422 --> 00:03:33,117
My Lord, why did you give her
your precious mask?

56
00:03:33,142 --> 00:03:34,172
Mmn?

57
00:03:34,197 --> 00:03:36,320
Yeah, I wonder why.

58
00:03:39,195 --> 00:03:40,766
I don't know either.

59
00:03:40,791 --> 00:03:45,039
But it felt like giving it to Chloe was
the most natural thing to do.

60
00:03:45,984 --> 00:03:47,633
Like it was the best thing to do.

61
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:49,672
I see.

62
00:03:49,697 --> 00:03:54,526
And I'm sure Shizu would be happier
that Chloe is the one to hold on to it.

63
00:03:54,526 --> 00:03:57,179
She will surely take good care of it.

64
00:03:57,204 --> 00:03:59,852
She might even take after Shizu
and become a Champion--

65
00:03:59,877 --> 00:04:03,023
or even a Hero, who knows.

66
00:04:03,048 --> 00:04:04,000
No way.

67
00:04:06,867 --> 00:04:07,805
Ranga.

68
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:09,461
Yes, My Lord.

69
00:04:09,898 --> 00:04:12,859
Let's go back to our town...
to our home.

70
00:04:12,884 --> 00:04:14,172
Everyone is waiting for us.

71
00:04:25,945 --> 00:04:28,070
This place should be good enough.

72
00:04:28,414 --> 00:04:31,563
Let's go back to Tempest
with Spatial Transportation.

73
00:04:31,563 --> 00:04:35,055
I'm sure everyone is looking
forward for your return.

74
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,695
Same goes for me!

75
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,461
But you're with me the whole time, anyway.

76
00:04:39,486 --> 00:04:40,438
Mnn?

77
00:04:41,758 --> 00:04:42,563
My Lord?

78
00:04:45,133 --> 00:04:47,406
I feel a strange presence...

79
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,242
This is...!

80
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:54,391
Ranga, get into my shadow.

81
00:04:54,416 --> 00:04:55,295
Yes, sir!

82
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:04,813
Report.

83
00:05:04,838 --> 00:05:06,273
What is it, Great Sage?

84
00:05:06,298 --> 00:05:08,391
You have been trapped inside
a wide-range barrier.

85
00:05:08,416 --> 00:05:09,641
Barrier?

86
00:05:09,666 --> 00:05:13,203
Any spatial-intervention skills targeted
beyond the barrier has been sealed.

87
00:05:13,617 --> 00:05:15,477
Spatial Transportation is now impossible.

88
00:05:15,502 --> 00:05:18,250
I have a bad feeling about this.

89
00:05:18,578 --> 00:05:19,422
Great Rimuru...

90
00:05:19,447 --> 00:05:20,180
Mmn?

91
00:05:20,529 --> 00:05:21,531
Soei!

92
00:05:23,359 --> 00:05:24,609
Is this your Body Double?

93
00:05:25,695 --> 00:05:27,836
Great Rimuru... please run!

94
00:05:28,742 --> 00:05:30,094
What happened?

95
00:05:30,119 --> 00:05:31,133
An enemy.

96
00:05:31,158 --> 00:05:32,797
An unimaginably powe--

97
00:05:34,258 --> 00:05:35,461
Soei!

98
00:05:37,617 --> 00:05:38,805
What's this?

99
00:05:39,195 --> 00:05:40,742
Just what is happening?

100
00:05:41,828 --> 00:05:43,195
Ranga!

101
00:05:47,586 --> 00:05:48,453
Report.

102
00:05:48,478 --> 00:05:49,835
What is it now?

103
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:52,328
You have been trapped inside
a different wide-range barrier.

104
00:05:52,353 --> 00:05:54,289
A different one? What's that?

105
00:05:54,314 --> 00:05:56,664
Any skill usage within
the barrier is sealed.

106
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:57,703
Resist it!

107
00:05:58,189 --> 00:05:59,939
(Different Wide-Rang Barrier)

108
00:05:59,964 --> 00:06:01,498
(Resist)

109
00:06:01,531 --> 00:06:03,328
Resist succeed.

110
00:06:03,555 --> 00:06:07,158
However, all magic-oriented
skills are restricted.

111
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:08,664
Seriously?!

112
00:06:09,244 --> 00:06:10,704
Come to think of it,

113
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:13,164
if there was someone trying
to deploy a barrier like this.

114
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:15,673
there is no way Soei and others
didn't notice about it.

115
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:21,594
And if I was caught in this barrier before he
could warn me via Thought Communication...

116
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:25,266
It should be safe to assume that this
attack is targeted solely on me.

117
00:06:25,562 --> 00:06:28,500
If so, then for what purpose?

118
00:06:28,977 --> 00:06:31,099
I can feel an intense killing intent.

119
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:32,344
This is bad.

120
00:06:32,369 --> 00:06:35,156
To think that I got my ability sealed
before the fight even started.

121
00:06:36,242 --> 00:06:38,690
That's another way to fight, I see.

122
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:41,891
This must be the work of a professional,
master in monster combat.

123
00:06:51,672 --> 00:06:53,742
Nice to meet you, I guess.

124
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:56,062
It won't be long, though.

125
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,109
Is she alone?

126
00:06:58,180 --> 00:06:59,930
She sure have a lot of confidence.

127
00:07:00,648 --> 00:07:02,086
Holy Knight...

128
00:07:02,516 --> 00:07:06,445
A guardian of law and order,
a sworn enemy of all monsters.

129
00:07:07,258 --> 00:07:10,889
I'm sure this is the first time we meet,
but do you need something from me?

130
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:12,933
Maybe you've mistaken me for someone else.

131
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:14,516
How polite of you.

132
00:07:14,541 --> 00:07:17,828
Ruler of the country of monster,
Rimuru Tempest.

133
00:07:17,853 --> 00:07:19,453
So it's me after all.

134
00:07:19,687 --> 00:07:22,390
Why makes you think
I'm the ruler of monsters?

135
00:07:22,445 --> 00:07:25,703
As you can see, I'm just
a regular adventurer.

136
00:07:25,969 --> 00:07:28,564
It's pointless to play dumb.
We have an informant.

137
00:07:29,492 --> 00:07:30,570
Informant?

138
00:07:30,595 --> 00:07:34,037
We have 'eyes' all over Engrassia.

139
00:07:34,037 --> 00:07:35,219
Eyes?

140
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:39,187
I don't get it. Who sold me off?

141
00:07:39,212 --> 00:07:41,945
Your town is a hindrance.

142
00:07:42,281 --> 00:07:44,062
That's why we're going to crush it.

143
00:07:44,087 --> 00:07:45,555
What did you say?

144
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:49,689
That's why we can't let you
go back right now.

145
00:07:49,789 --> 00:07:51,638
Do you understand?

146
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:55,308
You guys going to crush Tempest?
Like, right now?

147
00:07:56,336 --> 00:07:58,797
Who knows. Feel free to guess.

148
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:24,379
Not dead yet?

149
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:26,673
You're as persistent as a cockroach.

150
00:08:26,992 --> 00:08:28,586
Hurry up and die already!

151
00:08:31,328 --> 00:08:33,133
M-Master...

152
00:08:33,266 --> 00:08:37,242
On behalf of my incompetent disciple,
I shall be your opponent.

153
00:08:37,586 --> 00:08:39,148
What's up with you, geezer?

154
00:08:39,173 --> 00:08:40,984
Don't get in my way!

155
00:08:42,282 --> 00:08:46,906
Calling me geezer? You sure have
no respect for the elderly, young brat.

156
00:08:46,961 --> 00:08:48,281
Oh?

157
00:08:48,314 --> 00:08:52,312
I have no respect to give to
a geezer who is just simply old!

158
00:09:00,414 --> 00:09:01,625
Are you okay?

159
00:09:01,976 --> 00:09:04,055
I-I'm fine...

160
00:09:04,367 --> 00:09:05,547
More importantly...

161
00:09:05,572 --> 00:09:08,664
Master's movement is slower than usual.

162
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:13,953
He couldn't use his power like usual.

163
00:09:14,875 --> 00:09:18,883
This barrier weakens a monster's power.

164
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:20,625
Master...

165
00:09:22,156 --> 00:09:23,453
This is nothing!

166
00:09:24,195 --> 00:09:26,562
I don't even need to use
my All-Seeing Eye.

167
00:09:26,587 --> 00:09:29,312
Geezer is best suited in the afterlife.

168
00:09:36,187 --> 00:09:37,992
M-Master!

169
00:09:42,461 --> 00:09:44,266
Mas...ter...

170
00:09:52,062 --> 00:09:54,469
I will apologize to Shogo later.

171
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:58,516
I will tell him I'm sorry
for breaking his toy.

172
00:10:05,766 --> 00:10:06,641
Huh?

173
00:10:21,562 --> 00:10:24,539
You sure entertain me a lot in spite
getting much weaker now.

174
00:10:24,564 --> 00:10:25,583
Shut your mouth!

175
00:10:41,047 --> 00:10:42,559
No need to worry.

176
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:45,186
Whatever happens, I will protect all of you.

177
00:10:46,875 --> 00:10:49,203
Sheesh, come on, don't cry.

178
00:10:49,228 --> 00:10:51,172
Now you can't see anything.

179
00:10:51,197 --> 00:10:52,617
There's nothing to be afraid of.

180
00:10:52,914 --> 00:10:55,258
Lady Shion will do something and
everything will be okay.

181
00:10:55,283 --> 00:10:57,344
Lady Shion is strong after all.

182
00:11:04,312 --> 00:11:05,289
This is the end!

183
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,812
It's time.

184
00:11:23,725 --> 00:11:27,062
Hey! I'm being attacked by monsters!

185
00:11:27,087 --> 00:11:28,641
Help me!

186
00:11:38,289 --> 00:11:41,719
We came here after hearing the report
that monsters just made a nation.

187
00:11:41,744 --> 00:11:43,710
What is this commotion all about?

188
00:11:43,735 --> 00:11:44,890
Run!

189
00:11:44,915 --> 00:11:50,352
In accordance with human law,
we will aid the pure citizens in danger!

190
00:12:18,516 --> 00:12:21,046
Why would you crush Tempest?

191
00:12:21,071 --> 00:12:22,891
Who orders you? For what reason?

192
00:12:24,219 --> 00:12:25,641
Can we start now?

193
00:12:28,633 --> 00:12:32,984
I wish not, but can you at least
tell me your name first?

194
00:12:34,148 --> 00:12:37,257
You're a monster but you're
interested in names?

195
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:40,266
It didn't matter to me
so I almost forgot to tell you.

196
00:12:41,867 --> 00:12:43,633
Well then, from the beginning.

197
00:12:43,658 --> 00:12:48,393
I am the god's right hand from
Holy Empire of Lubelius.

198
00:12:48,393 --> 00:12:53,022
Chief Knight of the Holy Emperor's Imperial
Guard and the Captain of the Crusaders.

199
00:12:53,047 --> 00:12:54,732
Hinata Sakaguchi.

200
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:57,474
Nice to be your acquaintance,
although it won't be for long.

201
00:12:57,748 --> 00:12:59,061
Hinata?!

202
00:12:59,086 --> 00:13:00,873
I see, so it's you.

203
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:03,881
I did hear that you're
the Captain of the Crusaders.

204
00:13:03,906 --> 00:13:06,491
But the Chief Knight of the
Holy Emperor's Imperial Guard?

205
00:13:06,928 --> 00:13:08,621
You sure know a lot.

206
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:11,287
Not that it pleases me
to be known by monster.

207
00:13:11,967 --> 00:13:15,003
But it is true that I hold both positions.

208
00:13:15,003 --> 00:13:16,420
Not that it means much, though.

209
00:13:16,912 --> 00:13:19,757
What I really serve is
not the Holy Emperor.

210
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:21,725
But the god Luminus.

211
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:23,443
Hey, can you please wait?

212
00:13:23,468 --> 00:13:25,748
I have something to talk about with you.

213
00:13:25,773 --> 00:13:27,600
I have no interest in words
from a monster.

214
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,228
I said wait!

215
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:34,022
So you dodged that one.

216
00:13:34,022 --> 00:13:35,569
I'm a bit surprised.

217
00:13:35,881 --> 00:13:38,401
As expected from the monster
that killed Ms.Shizu.

218
00:13:38,401 --> 00:13:40,111
I shall have my revenge.

219
00:13:40,111 --> 00:13:41,873
Like I said, wait!

220
00:13:41,898 --> 00:13:44,905
You're a Japanese, right? Me too.

221
00:13:45,264 --> 00:13:46,272
Japanese?

222
00:13:46,297 --> 00:13:49,370
That's right, Shizu asked me to
do something for you.

223
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:52,381
Shizu is asking a favor from you about me?

224
00:13:52,406 --> 00:13:55,877
Yeah, Shizu was really worried about you--

225
00:13:55,877 --> 00:13:58,338
You sure say weird stuff.

226
00:13:58,338 --> 00:13:59,717
Don't make me laugh.

227
00:14:01,381 --> 00:14:03,748
I'm telling you, I'm Japanese, okay!

228
00:14:03,773 --> 00:14:07,498
I died back there and got reincarnated
here as a slime, that's all.

229
00:14:07,523 --> 00:14:10,733
Just like what the informant said,
you insist on calling yourself Japanese.

230
00:14:10,758 --> 00:14:12,803
Your act is pointless.

231
00:14:12,828 --> 00:14:14,062
Informant?

232
00:14:14,062 --> 00:14:17,116
So whoever it is, it knows that I'm Japanese?

233
00:14:17,141 --> 00:14:17,858
Just who...

234
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,573
So you want a fight no matter what, huh?

235
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:28,498
You fighting me? All by yourself?

236
00:14:28,795 --> 00:14:30,444
How funny.

237
00:14:30,469 --> 00:14:31,873
You think you can win?

238
00:14:31,898 --> 00:14:33,553
Inside this barrier?

239
00:14:46,068 --> 00:14:47,537
Seriously?

240
00:14:53,092 --> 00:14:55,694
She is nullifying my Pain Nullification?!

241
00:14:55,719 --> 00:14:57,358
This is getting outta hand.

242
00:14:58,225 --> 00:14:59,686
Just three strikes...

243
00:14:59,711 --> 00:15:01,881
Maybe I underestimated you a bit.

244
00:15:11,069 --> 00:15:13,756
I feel like any more of that
would be dangerous.

245
00:15:13,781 --> 00:15:17,428
Have you noticed the danger
behind this skill?

246
00:15:17,866 --> 00:15:19,912
You have some intelligence, I see.

247
00:15:19,937 --> 00:15:24,459
Thanks for the compliment, but I'd be
a lot happier if you'd willing to hear me out.

248
00:15:24,998 --> 00:15:25,881
Answer.

249
00:15:25,906 --> 00:15:28,084
This arts-based skill does not
attack the material body

250
00:15:28,109 --> 00:15:32,849
but rather believed to directly attack
one's spiritual body.

251
00:15:32,849 --> 00:15:35,717
It deals damage directly to my spirit?

252
00:15:35,959 --> 00:15:37,467
How many hit left can I take?

253
00:15:37,492 --> 00:15:38,420
Report.

254
00:15:38,445 --> 00:15:40,398
Three more strikes will
lead to death.

255
00:15:40,398 --> 00:15:43,186
It will be over if I get hit
three more times?

256
00:15:43,526 --> 00:15:46,821
Seems like I'm the one who
underestimate my opponent.

257
00:15:46,821 --> 00:15:48,983
Well then, what should I do...

258
00:15:49,287 --> 00:15:51,131
Whatever you do is pointless.

259
00:15:51,156 --> 00:15:52,994
You're cornered.

260
00:15:52,994 --> 00:15:58,420
This Holy Field is the ultimate anti-monster
barrier, the pride of the Western Holy Church.

261
00:15:58,943 --> 00:16:02,842
So monsters trapped in this
barrier get weakened?

262
00:16:03,006 --> 00:16:06,217
All magicules inside
this barrier gets purified

263
00:16:06,467 --> 00:16:08,885
Even higher-level monster like you

264
00:16:08,885 --> 00:16:12,638
must use most of their energy
just to simply continue to exist.

265
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:15,459
They won't be able to use
the full extent of their power.

266
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:17,810
I feel it the hard way with
my body right now.

267
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:21,272
You seemed dissatisfied that
I came to you by myself.

268
00:16:21,272 --> 00:16:24,420
But normally, I wouldn't even have
to show up for a job like this.

269
00:16:25,037 --> 00:16:27,530
There is only one reason why I'm here.

270
00:16:33,623 --> 00:16:35,186
Just one strike left...

271
00:16:35,905 --> 00:16:38,920
I heard that you killed Ms. Shizu.

272
00:16:39,803 --> 00:16:41,209
Like I said, that is--

273
00:16:42,043 --> 00:16:44,712
I will have my revenge,
with my own hand.

274
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:46,923
I wanted to kill you myself.

275
00:16:46,923 --> 00:16:50,384
It's true that I did kill her in a way.

276
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:51,280
But that--

277
00:16:51,305 --> 00:16:52,397
That?

278
00:16:52,866 --> 00:16:55,373
The result is what's important,
so it doesn't matter.

279
00:16:55,748 --> 00:16:59,662
She was the only one who ever showed me
a shred of kindness in this world.

280
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:05,491
I want you to rely on me
whenever you lost your way.

281
00:17:08,553 --> 00:17:10,897
But she's no longer in this world.

282
00:17:11,475 --> 00:17:15,420
I don't really understand this feeling myself.

283
00:17:19,444 --> 00:17:22,667
Just who told Hinata about
Shizu's death?

284
00:17:22,667 --> 00:17:26,991
They dramatize so many parts and
made me look like some sort of villain.

285
00:17:28,006 --> 00:17:29,467
Are you worried about your friends?

286
00:17:29,492 --> 00:17:30,686
Of course.

287
00:17:30,711 --> 00:17:31,928
I bet you are.

288
00:17:32,342 --> 00:17:35,733
If you take too much time here,
you won't have a home to return to.

289
00:17:36,347 --> 00:17:38,569
Not that I intend to let you go, though.

290
00:17:38,873 --> 00:17:41,944
I think it's still too early to
decide who will win!

291
00:17:42,569 --> 00:17:44,373
Activate all physical strengthening!

292
00:17:44,398 --> 00:17:45,748
In this one strike!

293
00:17:54,842 --> 00:17:56,450
By observing my movement,

294
00:17:56,475 --> 00:17:58,999
she predicted my next action,
and is responding to it.

295
00:18:01,452 --> 00:18:04,795
It's like I'm fighting the Great Sage.

296
00:18:19,131 --> 00:18:20,358
This is not good.

297
00:18:20,383 --> 00:18:22,163
She's strong!

298
00:18:22,616 --> 00:18:23,842
The end.

299
00:18:23,867 --> 00:18:27,164
You did pretty well moving that
much in this barrier.

300
00:18:27,467 --> 00:18:29,567
To tell you the truth,
I underestimated you.

301
00:18:29,567 --> 00:18:32,748
But you can't win against me.

302
00:18:33,045 --> 00:18:35,764
Because you will kill me in
one more hit?

303
00:18:35,975 --> 00:18:38,295
Oh, you can tell?

304
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:43,928
This sword is infused with a special
ability known as Dead End Rainbow.

305
00:18:43,953 --> 00:18:47,584
It is guaranteed to leave its opponent
dead on its seventh strike.

306
00:18:48,842 --> 00:18:52,538
Even if they're a spiritual being.

307
00:18:53,327 --> 00:18:56,093
You did pretty well yourself,
but it should be enough.

308
00:18:57,475 --> 00:19:00,920
Not even I thought the situation
would be this desperate.

309
00:19:01,436 --> 00:19:04,506
But I will keep on struggling
until the end.

310
00:19:04,531 --> 00:19:08,420
I'm not kind enough to let myself
get killed by you so easily!

311
00:19:08,764 --> 00:19:11,692
Report. Using the unique skill De-generate,

312
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:15,654
the higher-level elemental Ifrit
has been separated into a pure elemental.

313
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:16,697
Okay.

314
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:18,324
Defeat my enemy!

315
00:19:19,092 --> 00:19:21,217
O' Ifrit, the high-level fire elemental!

316
00:19:37,381 --> 00:19:40,805
I didn't expect you would also have
high-level elemental under your control.

317
00:19:40,805 --> 00:19:41,967
However...

318
00:19:42,303 --> 00:19:44,897
It's still not a match for me.

319
00:19:51,155 --> 00:19:53,146
What did you do to Ifrit?

320
00:19:53,171 --> 00:19:54,529
Come back, Ifrit!

321
00:19:59,522 --> 00:20:01,100
Just what did she...?

322
00:20:02,444 --> 00:20:03,413
Answer.

323
00:20:03,438 --> 00:20:06,975
Ifrit appears to have fallen under
the effects of Force Takeover.

324
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,529
Force Takeover?

325
00:20:08,554 --> 00:20:11,655
So she can take over someone else's skill?

326
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:14,178
So that's her Unique Skill...

327
00:20:14,203 --> 00:20:18,444
It is believed that the magic channel connection
prevented the takeover from succeeding.

328
00:20:20,233 --> 00:20:22,061
Hinata Sakaguchi...

329
00:20:22,086 --> 00:20:24,890
She's a monster
far exceeding my expectation.

330
00:20:26,147 --> 00:20:28,444
So you tried to steal my Ifrit?

331
00:20:28,469 --> 00:20:31,077
I'm surprised. How did you know?

332
00:20:31,981 --> 00:20:34,567
Oh well, that's right.

333
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:38,271
With my Unique Skill, the Usurper.

334
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:40,241
Usurper...

335
00:20:40,952 --> 00:20:43,038
So it's like my Gluttony...

336
00:20:44,092 --> 00:20:45,420
Gluttony?

337
00:20:45,991 --> 00:20:47,303
Gluttony, huh...

338
00:20:51,194 --> 00:20:53,794
Seems like I must resolve
myself for this.

339
00:20:53,794 --> 00:20:56,155
One more strike and I will die.

340
00:20:56,686 --> 00:20:59,194
I must rely on my last resort.

341
00:21:00,428 --> 00:21:01,631
Hinata.

342
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:09,202
Shizu asked me to look after not
just the kids, but you too.

343
00:21:09,227 --> 00:21:11,163
But I have no time.

344
00:21:11,889 --> 00:21:14,327
I'm sorry but it doesn't seem like
I can afford to hold back.

345
00:21:15,155 --> 00:21:16,920
I'm will decide this with my next move.

346
00:21:17,905 --> 00:21:22,311
If so, then let me show you
some of my full strength.

347
00:21:22,842 --> 00:21:24,492
Be prepared.

348
00:21:24,492 --> 00:21:29,176
This blow will give you pain
that surpassed ones you ever felt before.

349
00:21:39,904 --> 00:21:41,232
Die!

350
00:21:41,257 --> 00:21:43,350
Dead End Rainbow!

351
00:21:43,375 --> 00:21:45,506
Awaken, Gluttony!

352
00:21:45,936 --> 00:21:48,217
Understood. Order accepted.

353
00:21:48,491 --> 00:21:50,295
Executing at once.

354
00:21:51,186 --> 00:21:57,569
Just as I gave the order, I felt
my consciousness sinks into darkness.

355
00:21:58,217 --> 00:22:00,233
As if I'm drifting off to sleep.

356
00:22:00,702 --> 00:22:03,944
My consciousness ends there.

357
00:22:14,124 --> 00:22:17,503
I'm used to losing things

358
00:22:17,503 --> 00:22:22,174
I said it like it's someone else's problem

359
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:26,053
It's a blurry realism

360
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:31,100
Because it's not about me

361
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:36,188
The nameless sadness disappears,
warped in a legato-like dream

362
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:40,359
Will we feel better if we hug each other?

363
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:44,613
The life which I repeat is a joined miracle

364
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:49,159
Don't forget me, pass your voice to me

365
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:56,792
If I were to live for someone's sake

366
00:22:56,792 --> 00:23:01,088
I wish that someone is you
(I'll tell you one more story)

367
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:05,426
If I can redo this world once again

368
00:23:05,426 --> 00:23:10,806
I will paint that story with love

369
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:15,060
You'll know how this story's gonna end

370
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:16,979
I will tell you

371
00:23:16,979 --> 00:23:19,356
I will tell you one more story

372
00:23:19,356 --> 00:23:23,652
You'll know how this story's gonna end

373
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:25,863
I will tell you

374
00:23:37,313 --> 00:23:40,878
Next Time, Despair
