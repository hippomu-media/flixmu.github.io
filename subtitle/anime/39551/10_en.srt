1
00:00:39,526 --> 00:00:42,323
I heard they got some pretty
monster ladies there.

2
00:00:42,348 --> 00:00:44,323
Yeah, first come first serve, okay?

3
00:00:44,348 --> 00:00:47,541
They got good woman, but I heard
they got pretty good treasures as well.

4
00:00:47,566 --> 00:00:48,736
- What?
- Is that true?

5
00:00:48,761 --> 00:00:49,978
Can't wait for it.

6
00:00:50,003 --> 00:00:51,143
Damn right.

7
00:00:51,495 --> 00:00:52,979
You guys.

8
00:00:53,004 --> 00:00:56,916
Raising your morale is good and all,
but take a rest while you can.

9
00:00:57,229 --> 00:01:00,401
Once you're done eating,
we will go back moving.

10
00:01:00,426 --> 00:01:01,698
Yeah, yeah.

11
00:01:02,362 --> 00:01:03,971
Give me a break.

12
00:01:14,971 --> 00:01:17,619
So they're the ones who
killed Shion and others...

13
00:01:18,221 --> 00:01:21,164
Doesn't seem like they deserve
any mercy.

14
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:24,543
I will have you be my food.

15
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:26,776
Well then...

16
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:29,923
Let's start.

17
00:01:43,297 --> 00:01:48,260
Let's give a name to a nameless flower

18
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:53,265
So that it won't freeze
from the coldness of solitude

19
00:01:53,265 --> 00:01:58,020
If it's as frail as it is beautiful

20
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:00,939
Then it's not as fragile anymore

21
00:02:02,524 --> 00:02:07,404
Like how you paint color
on a transparent body

22
00:02:07,404 --> 00:02:10,449
Beyond the page of the chapter

23
00:02:10,449 --> 00:02:13,160
It's welcoming you with a smile

24
00:02:14,703 --> 00:02:17,581
Whenever, as much as it takes

25
00:02:17,581 --> 00:02:20,584
Let's start a new world

26
00:02:20,584 --> 00:02:24,379
We're Storyteller

27
00:02:24,379 --> 00:02:28,509
All the love, hope, envy

28
00:02:28,509 --> 00:02:30,427
Even the song of despair we sing today

29
00:02:30,427 --> 00:02:34,473
It will all be a seed and bloom,
into a strong person

30
00:02:34,473 --> 00:02:40,479
Why does salvation
born from someone's tear

31
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:45,776
That's just sad

32
00:02:45,776 --> 00:02:52,616
Ideal and fantasy,
all mixed up by youthful impulse

33
00:02:52,616 --> 00:02:59,373
My real self, is now reborn!

34
00:03:00,533 --> 00:03:04,059
(Episode 34: Megiddo)

35
00:03:04,059 --> 00:03:05,268
Hey, look.

36
00:03:08,401 --> 00:03:10,557
All troops, prepare for battle!

37
00:03:10,582 --> 00:03:13,643
Stop or else we won't
show you any mercy!

38
00:03:13,668 --> 00:03:16,026
That's my line, you fools.

39
00:03:16,502 --> 00:03:17,775
Sorry.

40
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20,635
I'll have you help me vent my anger a bit!

41
00:03:37,354 --> 00:03:40,315
N-Nobody said anything about this--

42
00:03:58,815 --> 00:04:00,494
Mission accomplished.

43
00:04:00,519 --> 00:04:04,127
Now, I hope none of my allies pathetic
enough to have trouble with these.

44
00:04:06,151 --> 00:04:09,635
Dragonewt warriors! Follow after me!

45
00:04:10,284 --> 00:04:11,338
Enemy attack!

46
00:04:11,752 --> 00:04:13,487
Get to your position!

47
00:04:13,512 --> 00:04:14,823
Anti-air defense formation!

48
00:04:15,159 --> 00:04:16,893
Dragonnewts?!

49
00:04:16,918 --> 00:04:18,091
There's so many of them!

50
00:04:19,635 --> 00:04:21,807
My name is Gabiru!

51
00:04:21,832 --> 00:04:23,555
No need to remember it.

52
00:04:23,555 --> 00:04:25,580
Consider it a final gift before your death!

53
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:42,365
Apologies, Master Soei.

54
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:46,536
These people weren't as strong
as we anticipated them to be.

55
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:47,627
Seems like it.

56
00:04:50,713 --> 00:04:55,629
Looks like the Otherworlders are indeed
in the west as Great Rimuru had predicted.

57
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:02,468
Tch.

58
00:05:02,651 --> 00:05:06,014
Hey, hasn't anyone fled
from the town yet?

59
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:08,377
No enemy sighted today either, sir!

60
00:05:08,402 --> 00:05:09,402
Dammit.

61
00:05:10,104 --> 00:05:12,073
No need to rush.

62
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:14,314
There's no news from the other group,

63
00:05:14,339 --> 00:05:17,080
and this is the only road the monsters
could use to run away.

64
00:05:17,105 --> 00:05:19,510
Hmph, that better be the case.

65
00:05:21,164 --> 00:05:24,039
My fists are itching to go wild already.

66
00:05:25,219 --> 00:05:27,063
Well, I get what you feel.

67
00:05:29,227 --> 00:05:34,376
That feeling you get when you crushed
someone along with their confidence.

68
00:05:34,376 --> 00:05:35,877
It felt so good.

69
00:05:37,813 --> 00:05:39,055
Enemies up ahead!

70
00:05:40,696 --> 00:05:41,844
Their number...

71
00:05:42,532 --> 00:05:44,438
Eh? F-Four...

72
00:05:51,805 --> 00:05:53,430
That's all they got?

73
00:05:53,455 --> 00:05:54,255
Tch.

74
00:05:54,284 --> 00:05:55,084
Oh?

75
00:05:55,151 --> 00:05:57,149
That geezer is still alive?

76
00:06:04,266 --> 00:06:06,571
Well then, let's start with a bang.

77
00:06:06,596 --> 00:06:08,587
Yeah, don't fall behind.

78
00:06:17,219 --> 00:06:18,219
Good!

79
00:06:21,266 --> 00:06:23,627
You enemy of god!
What's that sorcery!

80
00:06:34,938 --> 00:06:36,254
Earthshatter Kick!

81
00:06:49,055 --> 00:06:51,494
Awesome, they did pretty well.

82
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:52,759
Interesting.

83
00:06:53,157 --> 00:06:54,998
I will be your opponent.

84
00:06:54,998 --> 00:06:56,479
Ah, yes, Sir Shogo!

85
00:06:56,504 --> 00:06:57,504
Yes, please!

86
00:07:02,743 --> 00:07:03,965
There he comes.

87
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:05,759
We will avenge Gobzo and others.

88
00:07:06,446 --> 00:07:07,446
But...

89
00:07:07,563 --> 00:07:09,969
Your opponent is not me.

90
00:07:10,712 --> 00:07:12,180
Rest assured.

91
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:14,969
I will give them what they deserve.

92
00:07:15,469 --> 00:07:17,243
I'm counting on you, Sir Geld.

93
00:07:17,268 --> 00:07:20,606
Spite how he might appear,
Gobzo is actually a very good guy.

94
00:07:32,962 --> 00:07:35,121
You got lucky and survived,

95
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:37,852
you should've just run away when you can.

96
00:07:39,782 --> 00:07:42,921
Spite how I look, I'm actually
a very sore loser.

97
00:07:42,921 --> 00:07:44,102
And also...

98
00:07:44,665 --> 00:07:48,626
I find it unpleasant to see young'uns
be so high on their horse.

99
00:07:48,751 --> 00:07:49,751
Ooh?

100
00:07:49,776 --> 00:07:51,888
You aren't talking about me, are you?

101
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:55,350
Does it not sound that way to you?
Well, my apologies.

102
00:07:55,350 --> 00:08:00,037
I suppose your brain's just as
empty as your morals.

103
00:08:01,438 --> 00:08:03,946
Getting slashed once is not
enough for you, it seems.

104
00:08:03,971 --> 00:08:06,344
Or perhaps, you have gone senile?

105
00:08:15,532 --> 00:08:17,071
Impatient, aren't you?

106
00:08:17,096 --> 00:08:19,332
But same goes for me.

107
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:23,586
I'm already at my limit trying
to hold down my anger, after all!

108
00:08:28,102 --> 00:08:29,571
What a joke.

109
00:08:29,596 --> 00:08:32,079
You couldn't do anything against
my sword last time.

110
00:08:32,524 --> 00:08:34,516
Don't get cocky, you old geezer!

111
00:08:34,541 --> 00:08:37,852
Not to your sword skill,
but to that power, that is.

112
00:08:38,290 --> 00:08:40,548
Space element, was it?

113
00:08:40,573 --> 00:08:42,673
Ooh, you can tell?

114
00:08:42,698 --> 00:08:45,391
Now the secret's out,
it's easy to deal with.

115
00:08:45,416 --> 00:08:46,743
Interesting.

116
00:08:46,768 --> 00:08:50,501
Then how about we fight with
our swords, fair and square?

117
00:08:51,407 --> 00:08:52,876
Very well.

118
00:08:56,829 --> 00:08:58,063
Well then...

119
00:08:58,548 --> 00:08:59,657
Here I go.

120
00:09:08,063 --> 00:09:10,360
You fool! I tricked you again!

121
00:09:19,626 --> 00:09:20,688
What?

122
00:09:22,594 --> 00:09:23,829
No way...

123
00:09:25,157 --> 00:09:28,276
To resort to such a trivial deceits.

124
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:31,082
Looks like I've overestimated you.

125
00:09:31,107 --> 00:09:33,188
What did you just do, geezer?!

126
00:09:33,213 --> 00:09:35,626
I see, you weren't able to see it?

127
00:09:35,651 --> 00:09:38,579
Then I suppose you're even less
than a second-rate.

128
00:09:38,704 --> 00:09:40,118
What did you say?

129
00:09:40,384 --> 00:09:42,907
I said less than a second-rate.

130
00:09:43,282 --> 00:09:46,377
Don't you underestimate me,
you senile piece of shit!

131
00:09:46,377 --> 00:09:50,048
Well then, let me show you
the true essence of swordplay.

132
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:54,704
Come, and pay close attention!

133
00:09:54,729 --> 00:09:58,225
Shut up! You shitty puny monster!
How dare you acting all tough!

134
00:10:06,618 --> 00:10:08,602
Hmph, whatever you do, it's pointless.

135
00:10:08,627 --> 00:10:14,313
My Extra Skill, All-Seeing Eye allows me
perceive my surroundings three times faster!

136
00:10:14,338 --> 00:10:17,993
A senile old man like you is practically
frozen in place in my eyes!

137
00:10:18,493 --> 00:10:20,501
Get slashed and die!

138
00:10:20,774 --> 00:10:23,594
Looks like your eyes haven't seen anything.

139
00:10:23,884 --> 00:10:24,977
Huh?

140
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:31,061
It's about time your "All-Seeing Eye"
catches up to my movement.

141
00:10:31,086 --> 00:10:33,180
Huh? What are you saying--

142
00:10:35,055 --> 00:10:38,078
Crestwater Slash!

143
00:10:39,086 --> 00:10:40,703
My body won't move.

144
00:10:40,728 --> 00:10:42,531
No, it can't!

145
00:10:47,917 --> 00:10:48,987
Eh?

146
00:10:49,242 --> 00:10:51,820
My mind acceleration... still going.

147
00:10:57,914 --> 00:10:59,719
It's over.

148
00:11:01,899 --> 00:11:04,914
Make full use of your remaining
extended time

149
00:11:04,939 --> 00:11:09,360
and reflect on all evil deeds
you have committed in your life.

150
00:11:20,852 --> 00:11:21,852
Tch.

151
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:27,117
That's unfair!

152
00:11:27,142 --> 00:11:29,211
If you're a man, fight with your bare hand!

153
00:11:29,236 --> 00:11:30,813
Nonsense.

154
00:11:30,838 --> 00:11:32,817
This is war.

155
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:38,055
Unfair or not, it is only polite to use
all power you have in a war.

156
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,383
Bullshit!

157
00:11:39,408 --> 00:11:42,235
You should be ashamed fighting
an unarmed man like that!

158
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:44,274
You're making less sense.

159
00:11:45,766 --> 00:11:47,047
Just kidding.

160
00:11:47,072 --> 00:11:51,294
Sorry, I figured you might throw
that annoying shield away if I say that.

161
00:11:51,294 --> 00:11:54,110
Well, I'm all heated up now.

162
00:11:54,135 --> 00:11:56,531
I guess it's time to get serious!

163
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:59,196
(Berserker Special Effect: Diamond Body)

164
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,758
I will fight you seriously now.

165
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:09,102
So you better entertain me a bit.

166
00:12:10,016 --> 00:12:11,024
Come.

167
00:12:20,522 --> 00:12:22,094
What's wrong?

168
00:12:22,119 --> 00:12:23,977
Is that all you got?

169
00:12:27,211 --> 00:12:28,242
What's this?

170
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:34,867
You fucking shit!

171
00:12:35,452 --> 00:12:38,266
Your physical strength is quite formidable.

172
00:12:38,897 --> 00:12:41,211
But it seems rather weak against "corrosion."

173
00:12:42,188 --> 00:12:43,805
Corrosion?

174
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:45,515
You shit!

175
00:12:46,555 --> 00:12:48,017
Let me end your pain.

176
00:12:49,024 --> 00:12:50,024
Wait!

177
00:12:50,211 --> 00:12:51,406
Please wait!

178
00:12:53,563 --> 00:12:55,586
You're still not done?

179
00:12:58,422 --> 00:13:00,680
I was just about to land
the final blow.

180
00:13:00,867 --> 00:13:01,867
Dammit.

181
00:13:02,203 --> 00:13:03,906
What did you do to Kyoya?

182
00:13:03,931 --> 00:13:06,922
Your friend? Here.

183
00:13:16,695 --> 00:13:20,039
Dammit, why did this happen to me?

184
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:22,797
If this keeps up, I'm dead.

185
00:13:32,141 --> 00:13:33,141
Kirara!

186
00:13:35,633 --> 00:13:36,867
What?

187
00:13:36,892 --> 00:13:39,086
You guys were loud, you know.

188
00:13:39,111 --> 00:13:41,711
I just had this nice dream
about the past.

189
00:13:41,914 --> 00:13:43,641
I was drinking bubble tea
in Harajuku and--

190
00:13:43,666 --> 00:13:45,360
I'm sorry, but...

191
00:13:45,385 --> 00:13:46,385
Huh?

192
00:13:46,899 --> 00:13:49,820
You gonna have to die for me.

193
00:13:51,047 --> 00:13:52,047
Are you joke--

194
00:14:08,563 --> 00:14:10,496
What an abominable deed.

195
00:14:10,521 --> 00:14:12,445
You have fallen that far?

196
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:14,774
No need for pity now.

197
00:14:14,799 --> 00:14:16,336
You are no warrior.

198
00:14:16,361 --> 00:14:17,274
Shut up!

199
00:14:17,299 --> 00:14:19,000
I want to live.

200
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:22,500
Can you hear it? The Words of
the World has told me.

201
00:14:22,899 --> 00:14:28,086
That by consuming Kirara's soul,
I have obtained the Survivor skill.

202
00:14:28,265 --> 00:14:33,976
Words of the World... so getting new
power was what he was after?

203
00:14:34,094 --> 00:14:37,543
Great Rimuru described killing an
ally as the greatest sin there is.

204
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:39,695
Shut up, you maggots!

205
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,711
I just have to win, that's all!

206
00:14:52,953 --> 00:14:54,047
Behold!

207
00:14:54,072 --> 00:14:55,770
The power of Berserker
that specialized in attack

208
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:58,295
and Survivor that specialized in defense!

209
00:14:58,327 --> 00:15:02,874
With Ultraspeed Regeneration and
All Elemental Nullification, I'm invincible!

210
00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:09,226
Even if you break my bones or slash
my head, it will heal itself in no time!

211
00:15:09,251 --> 00:15:11,020
How about that, you monster shits!

212
00:15:11,045 --> 00:15:15,248
This is it! This is my full power!

213
00:15:16,633 --> 00:15:18,086
Need a hand?

214
00:15:18,414 --> 00:15:19,836
No need.

215
00:15:21,789 --> 00:15:24,841
I don't mind fighting both of you
at the same time.

216
00:15:24,841 --> 00:15:27,149
You seem to have confidence
in your martial arts.

217
00:15:27,485 --> 00:15:29,595
Then let me face you
bare-handed as well.

218
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:31,264
Don't act tough.

219
00:15:31,264 --> 00:15:34,344
You just want excuses when you lose!

220
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:36,810
Take this!

221
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:54,370
Let's see just how long your
regeneration ability will last.

222
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:55,859
Stop... it...

223
00:15:59,711 --> 00:16:01,985
Stop it!

224
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:06,547
Stop...

225
00:16:06,572 --> 00:16:08,000
Please stop!

226
00:16:25,735 --> 00:16:27,781
I was just joking.

227
00:16:28,766 --> 00:16:31,969
I just got... carried away.

228
00:16:32,258 --> 00:16:33,070
Help me--

229
00:16:33,095 --> 00:16:34,235
Geld.

230
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:35,758
I will finish him now.

231
00:16:41,172 --> 00:16:43,149
I will crush your head in one hit.

232
00:16:47,711 --> 00:16:50,117
I shall relieve you from that pain.

233
00:17:02,781 --> 00:17:05,453
So you're the only one who survived.

234
00:17:05,478 --> 00:17:09,985
Looks like I've misjudged the power
of these monsters.

235
00:17:10,633 --> 00:17:11,914
Mister Razen!

236
00:17:11,939 --> 00:17:13,078
You're here to save me?

237
00:17:15,742 --> 00:17:18,406
I see, an Orc Lord.

238
00:17:18,688 --> 00:17:20,813
Unbelievably powerful one, at that.

239
00:17:20,838 --> 00:17:23,360
No wonder you guys were
no match against them.

240
00:17:23,385 --> 00:17:25,110
Let's retreat for now.

241
00:17:25,135 --> 00:17:26,195
I won't let you escape!

242
00:17:30,164 --> 00:17:31,516
Back down, Geld!

243
00:17:40,102 --> 00:17:41,586
You're sharp.

244
00:17:41,611 --> 00:17:43,399
So you see through my trap.

245
00:17:43,586 --> 00:17:46,399
Looks like I should be more
cautious of you instead.

246
00:17:46,424 --> 00:17:50,781
You sly fox. You've been cautious
of me from the very start.

247
00:17:50,969 --> 00:17:53,548
Not at all, Mister Kijin.

248
00:17:53,805 --> 00:17:58,360
It is only natural to be cautious of that
orc lord first in terms of brute strength.

249
00:17:58,977 --> 00:18:01,274
Well then, I'll take my leave.

250
00:18:01,299 --> 00:18:03,664
If we both survived, we might
meet each other again some--

251
00:18:03,689 --> 00:18:04,899
That won't happen.

252
00:18:06,039 --> 00:18:10,813
Because the battlefield you will be headed
for will be attended by my master.

253
00:18:11,945 --> 00:18:13,031
Master?

254
00:18:13,453 --> 00:18:17,250
Shouldn't he already been defeated
by that witch, Hinata Sakaguchi?

255
00:18:17,656 --> 00:18:19,078
He's still alive?

256
00:18:19,414 --> 00:18:21,642
You have all gone too far.

257
00:18:22,328 --> 00:18:26,688
You have enraged the one creature
in this world you shouldn't have.

258
00:18:27,024 --> 00:18:28,766
I pity you.

259
00:18:28,791 --> 00:18:31,133
Your death will not be pretty.

260
00:18:32,422 --> 00:18:34,172
Silly bluff!

261
00:18:34,197 --> 00:18:37,703
But I'll take it as a warning and
keep it in my mind.

262
00:18:38,024 --> 00:18:39,383
Well then, farewell!

263
00:18:43,102 --> 00:18:44,707
Will it be okay?

264
00:18:44,707 --> 00:18:46,828
Letting that sorcerer get away?

265
00:18:46,853 --> 00:18:48,878
I imagine not.

266
00:18:48,878 --> 00:18:52,477
But if we fought, everyone
here would've been dead.

267
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:56,886
That man had already
prepared a Nuclear Magic

268
00:18:56,886 --> 00:18:59,336
that would activate upon his death.

269
00:18:59,513 --> 00:19:00,617
Really?

270
00:19:00,642 --> 00:19:03,836
Well, it won't be an issue for Great Rimuru.

271
00:19:27,842 --> 00:19:29,210
Great Rimuru.

272
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:31,676
We've destroyed all magical
devices on the outskirts of town.

273
00:19:31,701 --> 00:19:32,701
Got it.

274
00:19:32,726 --> 00:19:35,021
Return to town and stay on guard.

275
00:19:35,046 --> 00:19:36,046
Yes, sir.

276
00:19:36,787 --> 00:19:37,803
Well then.

277
00:19:37,828 --> 00:19:39,138
How it's going, Great Sage?

278
00:19:39,163 --> 00:19:42,201
Report. The magic formula
calculation complete.

279
00:19:42,226 --> 00:19:43,951
Ready to activate.

280
00:19:46,295 --> 00:19:48,138
Everything's ready.

281
00:19:54,154 --> 00:19:55,403
At the very least,

282
00:19:55,861 --> 00:20:00,074
I grant you the honor to be
a service for my evolution.

283
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:08,661
I'm sorry... you saved me.

284
00:20:08,686 --> 00:20:10,607
Forget about it, Shogo.

285
00:20:10,632 --> 00:20:14,037
You're a valuable combat asset
for Falmuth kingdom.

286
00:20:14,381 --> 00:20:16,537
Yeah, I will win next time.

287
00:20:16,562 --> 00:20:17,826
I will show you that.

288
00:20:17,851 --> 00:20:18,959
You sure will.

289
00:20:19,185 --> 00:20:20,185
Here.

290
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:24,107
Looks like you're already healed.

291
00:20:24,132 --> 00:20:26,470
I assume it's thanks to your
newly obtained skill.

292
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:27,986
Good job, Shogo.

293
00:20:28,107 --> 00:20:30,787
Let me cast a healing magic
on you just in case.

294
00:20:31,369 --> 00:20:32,369
Sure.

295
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:41,357
You finally killed his mind?

296
00:20:41,382 --> 00:20:43,232
Isn't it earlier than planned?

297
00:20:43,466 --> 00:20:45,122
It can't be helped.

298
00:20:45,147 --> 00:20:47,865
He's hardly useful for us at this point.

299
00:20:48,193 --> 00:20:50,029
But it's quite a shame.

300
00:20:50,054 --> 00:20:55,810
Kyoya's Severer and Kirara's Bewilder
were lost before it got passed down to you.

301
00:20:56,126 --> 00:20:57,544
That's fine.

302
00:20:57,569 --> 00:20:59,529
There's always next time.

303
00:20:59,554 --> 00:21:02,740
That aside, you sure it will work?

304
00:21:02,765 --> 00:21:06,148
Rest assured. This is not my first time.

305
00:21:06,467 --> 00:21:11,259
Compared to my teacher's Reincarnation,
Possession is mere child's play.

306
00:21:25,357 --> 00:21:27,560
Are you... Sir Razen?

307
00:21:28,873 --> 00:21:31,529
Who else do I look like?

308
00:21:33,224 --> 00:21:37,463
How many years do you think
I've served Falmuth kingdom?

309
00:21:38,248 --> 00:21:43,013
With indomitable spirit and
power body combined,

310
00:21:43,038 --> 00:21:46,236
I am now the strongest
Majin in Falmuth's history.

311
00:21:47,545 --> 00:21:51,553
It sure feels weird to hear you
talk like that with Shogo's body.

312
00:21:53,763 --> 00:21:59,450
Well then, time to report to Edmaris
and show him what I'm reborn as.

313
00:22:00,701 --> 00:22:04,506
Surely I can defeat even
a Demon Lord in this state.

314
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:20,631
Anti-Magic Area installation complete.

315
00:22:20,631 --> 00:22:23,634
Enemy troops can no longer
utilize any magic.

316
00:22:24,935 --> 00:22:28,021
I won't let any single of you escape.

317
00:22:41,005 --> 00:22:41,904
What's this?

318
00:22:41,929 --> 00:22:43,717
Water... ball?

319
00:22:45,974 --> 00:22:46,982
Die.

320
00:22:47,724 --> 00:22:50,494
May the anger of the gods
sear through your very souls.

321
00:22:50,494 --> 00:22:52,913
Megiddo!

322
00:23:09,099 --> 00:23:10,113
Report.

323
00:23:10,138 --> 00:23:12,777
1788 deaths confirmed.

324
00:23:13,896 --> 00:23:15,628
1903.

325
00:23:16,904 --> 00:23:18,553
1999.

326
00:23:22,529 --> 00:23:24,631
2235.

327
00:23:25,857 --> 00:23:27,402
2806.

328
00:23:27,757 --> 00:23:29,381
3250.

329
00:23:30,334 --> 00:23:32,303
3729.

330
00:23:32,498 --> 00:23:34,381
4214.

331
00:23:34,406 --> 00:23:36,037
