1
00:00:04,977 --> 00:00:06,789
Sorry for keeping you all waiting.

2
00:00:06,814 --> 00:00:08,719
The meeting now starts.

3
00:00:09,828 --> 00:00:13,320
Our topic for today is about our approach towards humans from now on...

4
00:00:13,345 --> 00:00:15,859
...and resurrection of Shion and others!

5
00:00:30,313 --> 00:00:35,276
Let's give a name to a nameless flower

6
00:00:35,276 --> 00:00:40,281
So that it won't freeze from the coldness of solitude

7
00:00:40,281 --> 00:00:45,036
If it's as frail as it is beautiful

8
00:00:45,036 --> 00:00:47,955
Then it's not as fragile anymore

9
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:54,420
Like how you paint color on a transparent body

10
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:57,465
Beyond the page of the chapter

11
00:00:57,465 --> 00:01:00,176
It's welcoming you with a smile

12
00:01:01,719 --> 00:01:04,597
Whenever, as much as it takes

13
00:01:04,597 --> 00:01:07,600
Let's start a new world

14
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:11,395
We're Storyteller

15
00:01:11,395 --> 00:01:15,525
All the love, hope, envy

16
00:01:15,525 --> 00:01:17,443
Even the song of despair we sing today

17
00:01:17,443 --> 00:01:21,489
It will all be a seed and bloom, into a strong person

18
00:01:21,489 --> 00:01:27,495
Why does salvation born from someone's tear

19
00:01:27,495 --> 00:01:32,792
That's just sad

20
00:01:32,792 --> 00:01:39,632
Ideal and fantasy, all mixed up by youthful impulse

21
00:01:39,632 --> 00:01:46,389
My real self, is now reborn!

22
00:01:49,192 --> 00:01:52,988
A story about a certain girl and a dragon. (Episode 33: With Everything)

23
00:01:53,625 --> 00:01:58,156
Her parents were a dragon and a human, and she was raised as a Dragon Princess.

24
00:01:59,664 --> 00:02:04,906
One day, her dragon father made a small copy of himself

25
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:07,266
and gave it to his daughter to be her friend.

26
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:09,297
However...

27
00:02:09,703 --> 00:02:14,844
The small dragon was killed by a king who wanted to take over the Dragon Princess.

28
00:02:16,188 --> 00:02:20,789
The girl grieved, mourn, and raged.

29
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:24,132
With the power she inherited from her father,

30
00:02:24,226 --> 00:02:30,515
she killed the king, several hundred thousand of his people, and finally his whole country.

31
00:02:31,477 --> 00:02:34,984
After that, the girl evolved into a Demon Lord,

32
00:02:35,148 --> 00:02:39,531
and following that, the small dragon was miraculously resurrected.

33
00:02:41,172 --> 00:02:42,703
But...

34
00:02:42,728 --> 00:02:45,781
The small dragon had already lost its soul after its death.

35
00:02:45,906 --> 00:02:50,172
It is now nothing but an evil monster who would destroy everything on its path.

36
00:02:50,352 --> 00:02:52,672
A Chaos Dragon.

37
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:59,336
The girl once again mourns, and seals the dragon who was once her friend.

38
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:05,461
This tale was the start of the Dragon Princess who now became a Demon Lord.

39
00:03:07,852 --> 00:03:11,781
As such, I would like to become a Demon Lord.

40
00:03:16,922 --> 00:03:19,866
What?! Great Rimuru becoming a Demon Lord?!

41
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:21,304
- Psst! - Sorry.

42
00:03:22,094 --> 00:03:25,656
The Falmuth's army is heading this way...

43
00:03:29,795 --> 00:03:33,795
...so I'm going to eat over ten thousand of them and evolve into a Demon Lord.

44
00:03:37,762 --> 00:03:41,793
There is a three percent chance we can resurrect Shion and others.

45
00:03:48,426 --> 00:03:50,738
B-But, Great Rimuru...

46
00:03:50,763 --> 00:03:51,964
Wait.

47
00:03:51,989 --> 00:03:54,652
I'm sure you have a lot to say and ask.

48
00:03:54,677 --> 00:03:57,529
But I want you to listen until I'm finished.

49
00:03:57,529 --> 00:03:58,394
Understood.

50
00:04:01,051 --> 00:04:03,918
I'm a former human, a Reincarnator.

51
00:04:04,262 --> 00:04:08,558
In other words, I came from the same world as the Otherworlder.

52
00:04:10,876 --> 00:04:12,836
I died back in that world.

53
00:04:26,785 --> 00:04:28,855
And was reborn in this world.

54
00:04:29,894 --> 00:04:31,808
As a slime, that is.

55
00:04:40,152 --> 00:04:42,777
I was lonely at first, but...

56
00:04:54,894 --> 00:04:57,332
Later, I made friends.

57
00:05:09,668 --> 00:05:11,308
And comrades.

58
00:05:43,215 --> 00:05:44,613
It's you guys.

59
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,566
People I can call a family.

60
00:05:49,176 --> 00:05:50,832
People that are precious to me.

61
00:05:57,207 --> 00:05:59,526
I used to be a human,

62
00:05:59,526 --> 00:06:03,722
that's why that I said I love them and made a rule to not harm them.

63
00:06:04,762 --> 00:06:08,324
I'm a monster, but I thought I was still a human at heart.

64
00:06:08,801 --> 00:06:13,082
That's why I thought it would be nice to become friends with humans, too.

65
00:06:13,496 --> 00:06:16,621
It's already too late to regret about it now.

66
00:06:16,646 --> 00:06:20,207
And I didn't want you guys to be hurt from it.

67
00:06:24,113 --> 00:06:28,129
If only I hadn't stayed for too long in Engrassia...

68
00:06:28,754 --> 00:06:29,832
No.

69
00:06:29,857 --> 00:06:31,347
This is not your fault.

70
00:06:31,543 --> 00:06:36,441
We were too dependent on you to protect us.

71
00:06:37,066 --> 00:06:39,754
And that weak thinking led to this tragedy.

72
00:06:39,779 --> 00:06:44,511
It pains me as a brother to have my sister say it before I could.

73
00:06:45,426 --> 00:06:47,699
This has been an excruciating lesson for me.

74
00:06:48,332 --> 00:06:51,497
When I lost contact with you because of the barrier,

75
00:06:51,522 --> 00:06:53,908
that feeling of invincibility I always had, crumbled.

76
00:06:53,933 --> 00:06:57,840
It made me feel helpless deep in my heart.

77
00:06:58,715 --> 00:07:00,955
You have entrusted me to take care of the town.

78
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:04,371
So it is my fault for not being able to prevent this from happening.

79
00:07:04,777 --> 00:07:06,457
Wait a moment, Benimaru!

80
00:07:06,482 --> 00:07:09,417
If you're saying that, then it should be my fault as the head of security.

81
00:07:09,442 --> 00:07:11,152
I'm the one at most fault!

82
00:07:11,177 --> 00:07:11,949
No.

83
00:07:11,974 --> 00:07:12,838
Nnn?

84
00:07:12,863 --> 00:07:16,936
I should've paid more attention to those who pass the street for the first time.

85
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:18,168
Eeh?

86
00:07:18,193 --> 00:07:19,574
It's my fault.

87
00:07:20,246 --> 00:07:23,137
I might've taunted the enemy too much.

88
00:07:23,162 --> 00:07:24,762
Well, that can't be helped.

89
00:07:24,787 --> 00:07:27,129
Wait, wait, wait!

90
00:07:27,418 --> 00:07:29,887
I'm the one who let my guard down.

91
00:07:29,912 --> 00:07:33,238
We all end up like this because I prioritized my own personal affairs.

92
00:07:33,504 --> 00:07:35,504
It's all my responsibility.

93
00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:38,066
I'm really sorry.

94
00:07:38,965 --> 00:07:40,449
Great Rimuru...

95
00:07:42,762 --> 00:07:44,363
Great Rimuru.

96
00:07:45,629 --> 00:07:52,207
There is absolutely no problem in prioritizing your own desire.

97
00:07:52,496 --> 00:07:57,574
It was our own carelessness and weakness that caused this tragedy.

98
00:07:58,035 --> 00:08:03,658
We let those brutes pillage in because of our negligence.

99
00:08:03,683 --> 00:08:05,613
Am I wrong, everyone?

100
00:08:10,324 --> 00:08:11,605
You guys...

101
00:08:12,222 --> 00:08:13,201
Great Rimuru.

102
00:08:13,668 --> 00:08:16,543
You're our one and only master.

103
00:08:16,568 --> 00:08:19,582
Be it being friends with humans or becoming a Demon Lord,

104
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:23,211
whatever path you take, it is also ours to walk through.

105
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:27,011
Don't you hate having a former human like me as your master?

106
00:08:28,441 --> 00:08:30,855
But you're still you, right, Great Rimuru?

107
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,435
Well, that is true...

108
00:08:34,543 --> 00:08:37,910
The person we serve is you, Great Rimuru.

109
00:08:38,058 --> 00:08:40,855
It doesn't matter what you were in your previous life.

110
00:08:40,949 --> 00:08:41,949
That's right.

111
00:08:45,285 --> 00:08:47,316
We all share the same feeling.

112
00:08:47,341 --> 00:08:50,894
No one here has any problem with that.

113
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:54,121
We would simply follow your order.

114
00:08:54,465 --> 00:08:55,894
Really?

115
00:08:57,424 --> 00:09:00,862
- That's right! - You bet! - Yeah! - Of course!

116
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:06,277
So, I would like to ask...

117
00:09:10,543 --> 00:09:14,191
How are you planning to interact with humankind from now on?

118
00:09:14,754 --> 00:09:15,902
Yeah.

119
00:09:16,066 --> 00:09:20,105
From what I believe, humans can become either good or evil.

120
00:09:20,534 --> 00:09:23,378
Which will they be depends on their nature as a person,

121
00:09:23,403 --> 00:09:26,238
but it can change drastically depending on their environment.

122
00:09:27,089 --> 00:09:28,957
Even if they're a good person as an individual,

123
00:09:28,982 --> 00:09:33,348
if the country they live in walks on the path of evil, they too will follow suit.

124
00:09:34,558 --> 00:09:39,043
That's why I want to make an environment where humans can learn.

125
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:43,457
That we can be a good neighbor if we know each other better.

126
00:09:43,941 --> 00:09:47,621
That it will help us both to cross the barrier between races.

127
00:09:48,699 --> 00:09:51,433
I want to believe in that possibility.

128
00:09:52,348 --> 00:09:56,332
But still, that is just a hope for the future.

129
00:09:56,863 --> 00:09:59,473
It's still too early for that.

130
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:03,668
First, we need humans to acknowledge our presence.

131
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:05,230
I see.

132
00:10:05,582 --> 00:10:08,301
With Great Rimuru turning into a Demon Lord,

133
00:10:08,326 --> 00:10:11,019
they will know that negotiation by force is unfavorable.

134
00:10:11,316 --> 00:10:12,301
Yeah.

135
00:10:12,326 --> 00:10:15,653
On top of that, I will be there to keep other demon lords in check,

136
00:10:15,678 --> 00:10:19,794
serving as a shield for other human nations.

137
00:10:20,466 --> 00:10:24,418
If they are smart, other nations will surely choose to coexist.

138
00:10:24,933 --> 00:10:25,871
That's right.

139
00:10:25,896 --> 00:10:31,082
We're aiming to build a friendly relationship in the long run.

140
00:10:31,824 --> 00:10:33,652
That's my proposal.

141
00:10:37,394 --> 00:10:40,433
That is quite an idealistic thought.

142
00:10:40,831 --> 00:10:43,980
It's not what you expect from someone who's about to become a Demon Lord.

143
00:10:44,113 --> 00:10:44,887
Sheesh.

144
00:10:45,707 --> 00:10:47,949
But I like that.

145
00:10:48,183 --> 00:10:49,730
It's just so like you.

146
00:10:51,074 --> 00:10:53,262
Nothing's wrong with being idealistic.

147
00:10:53,699 --> 00:10:56,824
I believe Great Rimuru can make it.

148
00:10:57,207 --> 00:10:59,308
Such a dream-like world.

149
00:10:59,848 --> 00:11:02,328
There's no need to overthink about it.

150
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:04,965
All we have to do is to believe in Great Rimuru.

151
00:11:05,284 --> 00:11:07,750
If you do become a Demon Lord,

152
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:10,598
don't forget to give me job to do, okay?

153
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:13,629
We're Great Rimuru's loyal shadow.

154
00:11:14,066 --> 00:11:15,840
We will move according to your orders.

155
00:11:15,865 --> 00:11:16,769
Indeed.

156
00:11:16,794 --> 00:11:18,949
And of course, we too!

157
00:11:18,974 --> 00:11:20,301
Thank you guys.

158
00:11:20,723 --> 00:11:21,980
My Lord.

159
00:11:22,005 --> 00:11:24,207
I am your loyal fangs.

160
00:11:24,232 --> 00:11:26,855
The one who will tear apart any foe who stands in your path.

161
00:11:27,058 --> 00:11:28,316
Ranga...

162
00:11:29,379 --> 00:11:30,598
Sheesh.

163
00:11:31,066 --> 00:11:33,401
And you want us to build a new nation

164
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:36,070
and help you improve monsters' image, right?

165
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:38,707
You know me well, Lil' Youm!

166
00:11:40,129 --> 00:11:41,746
Ah, shove it.

167
00:11:45,457 --> 00:11:46,457
Rimuru.

168
00:11:46,482 --> 00:11:48,902
Let's be friend, too, from now on!

169
00:11:49,012 --> 00:11:49,754
Yeah.

170
00:11:50,262 --> 00:11:52,105
Yes, of course.

171
00:11:52,691 --> 00:11:54,418
Thank you everyone!

172
00:11:54,443 --> 00:11:57,191
Please put out with my selfishness from now on, too!

173
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:59,715
- Yes! - Of course!

174
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:02,332
- Yay! - Let's do it!

175
00:12:03,363 --> 00:12:05,254
I'm glad.

176
00:12:05,738 --> 00:12:08,816
This is indeed my home.

177
00:12:09,473 --> 00:12:12,299
Boundaries between human and monsters

178
00:12:12,324 --> 00:12:15,348
can surely be crossed if we look at each other properly.

179
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:19,042
I am certain of that.

180
00:12:23,629 --> 00:12:25,058
Well then.

181
00:12:25,371 --> 00:12:27,488
What do we know about the army?

182
00:12:27,644 --> 00:12:28,348
Yes.

183
00:12:28,676 --> 00:12:30,769
According to Soei's report,

184
00:12:31,418 --> 00:12:34,963
if they're going at this pace,

185
00:12:34,963 --> 00:12:38,370
the marching army will arrive at Tempest in three days.

186
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:44,480
Ten thousand of Falmuth's knights.

187
00:12:46,112 --> 00:12:48,253
Six thousands of mercenary.

188
00:12:49,223 --> 00:12:50,980
Around a thousand of mages.

189
00:12:52,887 --> 00:12:56,801
Lastly, three thousands of Western Holy Church's Temple Knights.

190
00:12:57,129 --> 00:12:58,801
That would be all of their allied force.

191
00:12:59,504 --> 00:13:01,988
So there are a total of twenty thousands of them...

192
00:13:02,613 --> 00:13:05,512
There are a lot of them, but it's not much of a big deal.

193
00:13:05,537 --> 00:13:06,410
No problem.

194
00:13:07,511 --> 00:13:09,122
As we expect from you!

195
00:13:10,183 --> 00:13:11,379
Twenty thousands.

196
00:13:11,404 --> 00:13:14,887
It's enough nutrient for me to evolve into a Demon Lord.

197
00:13:16,441 --> 00:13:22,168
I will likely evolve into a "True Demon Lord" by consuming this many human souls.

198
00:13:22,348 --> 00:13:23,918
How should we allot our forces?

199
00:13:23,943 --> 00:13:24,783
Nnn?

200
00:13:24,808 --> 00:13:27,918
My unit should address the main enemy presence.

201
00:13:28,043 --> 00:13:30,840
Please let us Goblin Rider to be the vanguard.

202
00:13:31,082 --> 00:13:34,418
I'm sorry but I want you guys to let me handle the allied force alone.

203
00:13:34,443 --> 00:13:35,215
Eh?

204
00:13:35,543 --> 00:13:36,855
There is a reason.

205
00:13:37,027 --> 00:13:39,793
It's related to resurrection of our fallen friends,

206
00:13:39,818 --> 00:13:43,527
and to do that, I need to become a Demon Lord.

207
00:13:44,207 --> 00:13:50,831
And to become one, I need to annihilate all the invaders by myself.

208
00:13:50,949 --> 00:13:52,254
I see...

209
00:13:54,738 --> 00:13:58,691
But still, isn't it too dangerous for you to go fight on your own?

210
00:13:58,716 --> 00:14:00,058
Don't worry.

211
00:14:00,083 --> 00:14:02,613
I won't let my guard down and I won't hold back either.

212
00:14:02,638 --> 00:14:04,418
I-Is that so...

213
00:14:06,051 --> 00:14:07,613
There is another reason...

214
00:14:11,379 --> 00:14:16,215
I need to take the responsibility for what happened.

215
00:14:16,754 --> 00:14:20,996
I mustn’t let myself take it easy from now on.

216
00:14:24,754 --> 00:14:25,973
Understood.

217
00:14:25,998 --> 00:14:27,840
We will leave it all to you.

218
00:14:29,973 --> 00:14:33,816
And so, I would like you guys handle something else.

219
00:14:33,879 --> 00:14:34,637
Yes!

220
00:14:34,662 --> 00:14:35,707
We will do anything!

221
00:14:38,699 --> 00:14:42,605
There are magical devices in all four cardinal directions of our town, generating the barrier.

222
00:14:43,207 --> 00:14:46,465
Each is being guarded by a company of knights.

223
00:14:47,027 --> 00:14:50,605
I want you guys to attack and take them all down simultaneously.

224
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:51,660
Oh?

225
00:14:52,012 --> 00:14:55,043
Then we need to decide which unit to deploy.

226
00:14:55,342 --> 00:14:56,813
Please let me- 

227
00:14:56,813 --> 00:14:57,941
Me too!

228
00:14:57,966 --> 00:15:00,191
I'm dead serious this time.

229
00:15:00,216 --> 00:15:01,324
No need to rush.

230
00:15:01,349 --> 00:15:02,723
I already picked the personnel.

231
00:15:05,871 --> 00:15:08,176
First, Benimaru will tackle the east.

232
00:15:08,605 --> 00:15:12,637
Hakuro, Rigur, Gobta, and Geld will handle the west.

233
00:15:13,379 --> 00:15:15,637
The south will be handled by Gabiru and his men.

234
00:15:17,621 --> 00:15:20,168
And on the north is Soei and his fellows.

235
00:15:20,832 --> 00:15:23,824
Thank you for providing us with the opportunity.

236
00:15:23,849 --> 00:15:25,199
Just leave it to us!

237
00:15:27,855 --> 00:15:28,918
Can you win?

238
00:15:28,943 --> 00:15:30,638
It's an easy feat.

239
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:31,848
Good.

240
00:15:31,957 --> 00:15:33,027
Benimaru.

241
00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:34,976
Not that I'm worried about your skill,

242
00:15:34,976 --> 00:15:38,104
but you will be operating solo against nearly a hundred knights.

243
00:15:38,104 --> 00:15:39,808
If you sense any danger...

244
00:15:39,833 --> 00:15:41,355
Rest assured.

245
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:44,176
There is no need to hold back this time.

246
00:15:44,715 --> 00:15:47,738
Then the more reason you don't have to worry.

247
00:15:48,191 --> 00:15:52,308
Great Rimuru, I have no intention in letting my guard down the second time.

248
00:15:52,488 --> 00:15:56,332
And considering you put me on the west team...

249
00:16:01,207 --> 00:16:05,816
...that means there's a high chance they will be there, is it not?

250
00:16:06,051 --> 00:16:07,215
Yeah.

251
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:10,457
I'm sure they're blocking the path to Blumund.

252
00:16:10,933 --> 00:16:13,151
That should be where their strongest troops are at.

253
00:16:13,176 --> 00:16:17,449
There is a high chance that the attackers are Otherworlder like me.

254
00:16:18,848 --> 00:16:21,168
Not a problem by any means.

255
00:16:21,193 --> 00:16:24,848
I lost due to my own negligence.

256
00:16:24,996 --> 00:16:28,848
But I had already seen through his attacks.

257
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:31,214
Okay, I'm counting on you.

258
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:32,808
Great Rimuru!

259
00:16:32,833 --> 00:16:35,168
We're not as weak as we were before!

260
00:16:35,301 --> 00:16:39,215
We have the power to fight, not just to be protected by Sir Hakuro.

261
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,441
That's right!

262
00:16:40,466 --> 00:16:42,644
We're going to avenge Gobzo!

263
00:16:43,027 --> 00:16:48,683
I promise you I will make full use of this power you bestow me as an Orc King.

264
00:16:48,918 --> 00:16:50,824
That's assuring.

265
00:16:50,849 --> 00:16:55,306
Let's destroy the magical devices and get rid of this annoying weakening barrier!

266
00:16:55,306 --> 00:16:56,512
Yes, sir!

267
00:16:57,113 --> 00:16:58,113
Shuna.

268
00:16:58,191 --> 00:16:58,855
Yes.

269
00:16:59,402 --> 00:17:04,488
There is a chance this annoying barrier is what keeping everyone's soul within our reach.

270
00:17:04,887 --> 00:17:06,058
You understand?

271
00:17:06,129 --> 00:17:07,129
Yes.

272
00:17:07,269 --> 00:17:09,863
You want me to put on another barrier on its place, right?

273
00:17:10,004 --> 00:17:11,488
That's right.

274
00:17:11,668 --> 00:17:12,722
Leave it to me.

275
00:17:12,769 --> 00:17:16,793
I will do my best to keep the chance of their resurrection at an all-time high.

276
00:17:17,269 --> 00:17:18,426
And about that.

277
00:17:18,637 --> 00:17:19,660
Mjurran.

278
00:17:20,668 --> 00:17:22,777
I want you to lend us your strength.

279
00:17:22,802 --> 00:17:24,691
Please help Shuna.

280
00:17:24,949 --> 00:17:26,347
Understood.

281
00:17:26,691 --> 00:17:31,121
To atone for my mistake, I will surely fulfill your expectation.

282
00:17:31,308 --> 00:17:33,613
Pleased to work with you, Mjurran.

283
00:17:33,879 --> 00:17:35,629
Yes, likewise.

284
00:17:35,933 --> 00:17:38,316
Then we will be their bodyguard.

285
00:17:38,341 --> 00:17:39,190
Yeah.

286
00:17:39,215 --> 00:17:42,340
We will protect Shuna and Mjurran, too!

287
00:17:42,365 --> 00:17:43,293
Yeah!

288
00:17:43,318 --> 00:17:44,441
Leave it to us!

289
00:17:46,043 --> 00:17:47,026
Rigurd.

290
00:17:47,051 --> 00:17:49,026
I'm leaving you in command.

291
00:17:49,051 --> 00:17:49,965
Yes!

292
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:53,785
The allied force must be assuming the battle will start in three days.

293
00:17:54,113 --> 00:17:59,004
But, starting this moment, we will start our attack on them!

294
00:17:59,379 --> 00:18:02,090
We will resurrect Shion and others!

295
00:18:27,201 --> 00:18:28,560
Comrades...

296
00:18:29,045 --> 00:18:30,396
Friends...

297
00:18:31,381 --> 00:18:32,732
Family...

298
00:18:33,701 --> 00:18:35,545
What a good thing to have.

299
00:18:36,787 --> 00:18:39,412
Well then, time for me to prepare.

300
00:18:42,872 --> 00:18:44,373
Could it be...

301
00:18:46,928 --> 00:18:51,537
Clayman's goal is actually those ten thousand human souls?

302
00:18:54,357 --> 00:18:59,045
He used us to trigger a war to harvest a huge amount of souls at once.

303
00:19:00,725 --> 00:19:04,451
So that he can evolve into a "True Demon Lord."

304
00:19:07,975 --> 00:19:13,014
If that's the case, then Clayman is nothing but a small fry for me.

305
00:19:13,623 --> 00:19:14,803
But...

306
00:19:15,301 --> 00:19:17,902
I already consider him as my enemy.

307
00:19:18,629 --> 00:19:22,356
After this is done, next is...

308
00:19:28,512 --> 00:19:31,199
Sir Gabiru!

309
00:19:31,224 --> 00:19:33,645
Hey!

310
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:35,442
Oh, it's you guys!

311
00:19:35,467 --> 00:19:38,537
Great Rimuru let us get outside the barrier.

312
00:19:38,562 --> 00:19:41,100
I see, good things you guys are safe.

313
00:19:41,125 --> 00:19:42,834
You too, Sir Gabiru!

314
00:19:42,859 --> 00:19:44,521
We're glad you're safe!

315
00:19:44,546 --> 00:19:47,459
Ah! You guys!

316
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:54,732
We might be born at different time, but we will die together!

317
00:19:54,757 --> 00:19:57,795
Sir Gabiru!

318
00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:00,295
You guys!

319
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,443
Are you done?

320
00:20:02,584 --> 00:20:03,404
Yeah.

321
00:20:04,029 --> 00:20:05,404
Time to go.

322
00:20:07,037 --> 00:20:08,350
Oooh.

323
00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:12,287
Well then, my men! Are you ready?!

324
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:16,896
Time to show them the power of the Dragonewt!

325
00:20:19,969 --> 00:20:22,607
Let's get moving!

326
00:20:26,904 --> 00:20:28,826
Sir Gabiru, so cool!

327
00:20:28,851 --> 00:20:30,060
Indeed he is!

328
00:20:30,085 --> 00:20:32,146
Okay, let's follow him!

329
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:51,130
So they're the ones who killed Shion and others...

330
00:21:53,019 --> 00:21:55,965
Doesn't seem like they deserve any mercy.

331
00:21:57,402 --> 00:21:59,794
I will have you be my food.

332
00:22:00,965 --> 00:22:02,496
Well then...

333
00:22:04,082 --> 00:22:05,363
Let's start.

334
00:22:14,124 --> 00:22:17,503
I'm used to losing things

335
00:22:17,503 --> 00:22:22,174
I said it like it's someone else's problem

336
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:26,053
It's a blurry realism

337
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:31,100
Because it's not about me

338
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:36,188
The nameless sadness disappears, warped in a legato-like dream

339
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:40,359
Will we feel better if we hug each other?

340
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:44,613
The life which I repeat is a joined miracle

341
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:49,159
Don't forget me, pass your voice to me

342
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:56,792
If I were to live for someone's sake

343
00:22:56,792 --> 00:23:01,088
I wish that someone is you (I'll tell you one more story)

344
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:05,426
If I can redo this world once again

345
00:23:05,426 --> 00:23:10,806
I will paint that story with love

346
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:15,060
You'll know how this story's gonna end

347
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:16,979
I will tell you

348
00:23:16,979 --> 00:23:19,356
I will tell you one more story

349
00:23:19,356 --> 00:23:23,652
You'll know how this story's gonna end

350
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:25,863
I will tell you

351
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:40,085
Next time, "Megiddo."
