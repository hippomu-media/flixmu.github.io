1
00:00:08,417 --> 00:00:13,125
I decided to place "it" upon this land.

2
00:00:19,792 --> 00:00:24,000
"It" is capable of collecting information.

3
00:00:27,917 --> 00:00:29,567
Light.

4
00:00:29,667 --> 00:00:31,667
Scent.

5
00:00:31,667 --> 00:00:33,583
Sound.

6
00:00:33,583 --> 00:00:35,917
Joy.

7
00:00:35,917 --> 00:00:37,542
Sadness.

8
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:46,333
"It" collects information through stimulation.

9
00:00:48,875 --> 00:00:52,917
And it is able to replicate and alter its forms.

10
00:00:59,292 --> 00:01:02,917
"It" turned into a young boy

11
00:01:04,625 --> 00:01:06,292
and ventured out into the world.

12
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:14,708
The girl from Ninannah, March.

13
00:01:22,208 --> 00:01:26,083
She was selected 
to be the sacrifice to the Spirit Bear.

14
00:01:32,542 --> 00:01:36,250
However, she ran away during the journey.

15
00:01:44,333 --> 00:01:47,750
March's actions...

16
00:01:52,417 --> 00:01:56,125
gave "it" a new stimulus.

17
00:01:57,333 --> 00:02:02,917
"Thank you".

18
00:02:02,917 --> 00:02:06,000
"Thank you".

19
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,083
"Thank you".

20
00:02:16,375 --> 00:02:21,083
In a world filled with impetuses,

21
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:27,500
"Its" journey has just begun.

22
00:02:33,417 --> 00:02:34,292
Goodness.

23
00:02:34,292 --> 00:02:37,833
March is not your mother, you know.

24
00:04:05,542 --> 00:04:07,875
TO YOUR ETERNITY

25
00:04:09,042 --> 00:04:10,667
Give me your hands.

26
00:04:19,041 --> 00:04:21,124
Like this.

27
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,583
Here. For you.

28
00:04:34,042 --> 00:04:36,208
You're just like a child.

29
00:04:36,208 --> 00:04:38,167
Even though you don't have 
any paint on your face.

30
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:43,042
Where did you come from?

31
00:04:43,042 --> 00:04:45,333
You're not from Ninannah, right?

32
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:48,250
You don't look like you're from Yanome, either.

33
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:50,667
Are you an aboriginal?

34
00:04:53,708 --> 00:04:57,458
Right. Let me give you a name.

35
00:04:57,458 --> 00:04:59,250
Let me think...

36
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:02,000
You are immortal, so I'll call you "Fuji"...

37
00:05:03,292 --> 00:05:04,917
"Fuji"...

38
00:05:06,433 --> 00:05:09,058
Oh, I know. What about "Fushi"?

39
00:05:09,083 --> 00:05:10,958
No good?

40
00:05:10,958 --> 00:05:13,083
Then... What about "Fu"?

41
00:05:18,167 --> 00:05:19,958
Fu!

42
00:05:21,875 --> 00:05:25,875
EPISODE THREE
A MINOR EVOLUTION

43
00:05:36,667 --> 00:05:39,625
I've waited so long I'm sleepy.

44
00:05:39,625 --> 00:05:41,500
They sure are taking a long time.

45
00:06:44,375 --> 00:06:45,750
What is it?

46
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:27,958
Run!

47
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:30,375
March...

48
00:08:33,625 --> 00:08:36,417
I've found you, March.

49
00:09:05,875 --> 00:09:09,542
March... I'm coming to save you...

50
00:09:16,708 --> 00:09:19,333
Fu... Mom has to go now...

51
00:09:19,333 --> 00:09:21,042
Just kidding.

52
00:09:21,917 --> 00:09:23,458
Thank you!

53
00:09:29,292 --> 00:09:31,542
The majority of animals

54
00:09:31,542 --> 00:09:34,417
cannot choose the environment they inhabit.

55
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:39,000
As such, in order to accommodate,

56
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,208
they must change themselves.

57
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:46,042
For humans,

58
00:09:46,042 --> 00:09:49,250
the foremost sign of this change...

59
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:51,125
is "emotion".

60
00:10:18,375 --> 00:10:20,875
March, where are you?

61
00:10:20,875 --> 00:10:22,125
Where are you?

62
00:10:35,583 --> 00:10:40,000
Um... Have you seen 
a small girl around here?

63
00:10:42,667 --> 00:10:44,542
She has long hair...

64
00:10:51,375 --> 00:10:52,708
Where are you going?

65
00:10:57,542 --> 00:10:59,208
Where...

66
00:11:08,292 --> 00:11:10,042
That's...

67
00:11:10,708 --> 00:11:13,167
Please eat this.

68
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:26,917
What is this? It tastes weird.

69
00:11:26,917 --> 00:11:28,958
All the girls who become sacrifices

70
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:31,292
have to eat this.

71
00:11:31,292 --> 00:11:32,875
Do eat all of it.

72
00:11:38,375 --> 00:11:40,042
Speaking of which, March,

73
00:11:40,042 --> 00:11:44,708
who was the person with you before?

74
00:11:44,708 --> 00:11:47,667
He seemed to be neither 
of the Yanome or the Ninannah.

75
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:52,250
A traveler.

76
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:54,958
We passed by coincidence.

77
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:56,500
Don't lie to us!

78
00:11:56,500 --> 00:12:00,875
Hayase! That was the thing we saw!

79
00:12:05,542 --> 00:12:08,708
The other-worldly monster!

80
00:12:09,833 --> 00:12:11,042
There you are!

81
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,708
Guys!

82
00:12:13,708 --> 00:12:16,792
Hey, why aren't you standing guard?

83
00:12:16,792 --> 00:12:18,250
This way is too dangerous!

84
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:21,208
We got attacked and lost one man!

85
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:22,292
Attacked?

86
00:12:22,292 --> 00:12:24,042
Yes! By a bear!

87
00:12:24,042 --> 00:12:25,292
A bear?

88
00:12:26,208 --> 00:12:30,500
It had spikes on its body...
It must definitely be the Spirit Bear!

89
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,667
The Spirit Bear is just a legend.

90
00:12:32,667 --> 00:12:36,083
Are you sure it wasn't a normal bear?

91
00:12:36,083 --> 00:12:39,625
That wasn't just a normal bear!

92
00:12:40,458 --> 00:12:41,708
We have no other choice.

93
00:12:41,708 --> 00:12:43,917
We'll take a detour and head to the altar.

94
00:12:44,625 --> 00:12:46,042
Are you serious?

95
00:12:46,042 --> 00:12:48,458
There are monsters and bears!

96
00:12:48,458 --> 00:12:49,750
It's too dangerous!

97
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:51,583
Let's go back to the village!

98
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:52,833
No.

99
00:13:10,458 --> 00:13:12,083
Let's go.

100
00:13:14,375 --> 00:13:19,125
(March will not be able to grow up)

101
00:13:27,833 --> 00:13:33,375
(This is the choice March made)

102
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:43,542
("You made a great choice, March")

103
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:43,958
(It's better this way)

104
00:14:49,125 --> 00:14:50,875
She's asleep.

105
00:14:53,208 --> 00:14:54,792
We are finished here.

106
00:14:54,792 --> 00:14:56,750
Let's head back.

107
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:59,125
This time around was tiring.

108
00:14:59,125 --> 00:15:02,208
We must also report 
to the Yanome that one of us died...

109
00:15:27,167 --> 00:15:29,083
What was that sound?

110
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:41,000
That's...

111
00:15:48,917 --> 00:15:49,875
No way!

112
00:15:49,875 --> 00:15:53,083
It's the Spirit Bear!

113
00:16:00,875 --> 00:16:02,167
March!

114
00:16:02,792 --> 00:16:05,333
-You...
-Wait.

115
00:16:05,333 --> 00:16:06,625
Isn't this fine?

116
00:16:06,625 --> 00:16:08,875
Now we'll have two sacrifices.

117
00:16:17,625 --> 00:16:19,125
It's so tight...

118
00:16:31,625 --> 00:16:32,917
Wake up!

119
00:16:32,917 --> 00:16:34,250
March!

120
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:46,417
You don't need to protect 
these useless traditions!

121
00:16:47,708 --> 00:16:52,042
It's fine if you choose to grow up!

122
00:17:11,541 --> 00:17:13,124
Let's go.

123
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:16,124
Close the gate.

124
00:18:07,542 --> 00:18:08,917
He was eaten...

125
00:18:15,042 --> 00:18:16,292
No...

126
00:18:16,292 --> 00:18:17,792
Wait...

127
00:18:17,792 --> 00:18:19,375
He's...

128
00:18:19,375 --> 00:18:22,333
still trying to do something...

129
00:20:10,792 --> 00:20:13,250
What... is that thing?

130
00:20:38,208 --> 00:20:40,250
Is this... the work of God?

131
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,917
March...

132
00:20:58,833 --> 00:21:00,292
March!

133
00:21:05,875 --> 00:21:07,583
March!

134
00:21:08,917 --> 00:21:11,417
Big... sister...

135
00:21:17,875 --> 00:21:20,083
What happened?

136
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:35,042
Listen up.

137
00:21:35,042 --> 00:21:36,792
I'll pretend that the ritual was a success

138
00:21:36,792 --> 00:21:39,458
and that March died.

139
00:21:40,417 --> 00:21:43,333
You understand what this means, right?

140
00:21:46,708 --> 00:21:50,750
Die here together, 
or come to our country and live.

141
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:52,250
Make a choice.

142
00:21:57,667 --> 00:21:59,583
March!

143
00:21:59,583 --> 00:22:00,583
Let's go!

144
00:22:01,708 --> 00:22:03,583
Let's live!

145
00:22:03,583 --> 00:22:07,417
Take them back to Yanome.

146
00:22:07,417 --> 00:22:08,792
All of them.

147
00:22:10,292 --> 00:22:13,542
The kid, the bear...

148
00:22:13,542 --> 00:22:16,500
and that wolf.

149
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,833
What happened, doggy?

150
00:22:29,833 --> 00:22:31,958
-Are you hungry?
-March, no!

151
00:22:31,958 --> 00:22:33,458
It's dangerous!

152
00:22:41,042 --> 00:22:42,667
It ate it.

153
00:22:55,875 --> 00:22:59,208
Thank you.

154
00:24:30,458 --> 00:24:37,958
Spared from death,
Parona and March were imprisoned by Hayase.

155
00:24:37,958 --> 00:24:40,458
They celebrate their regained lives

156
00:24:40,458 --> 00:24:43,958
on the bustling streets of Yanome.

157
00:24:43,958 --> 00:24:45,500
However,

158
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:49,792
Hayase appears to have
other intentions for the immortal being.

159
00:24:49,792 --> 00:24:51,000
Driving them once again

160
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,917
"EPISODE FOUR A LARGE VESSEL"
into dangers.
