1
00:00:06,292 --> 00:00:09,708
"It" departed for the south.

2
00:00:10,583 --> 00:00:15,708
"It" collects information through stimulation.

3
00:00:15,708 --> 00:00:18,000
And it is able to replicate and emulate them.

4
00:00:20,958 --> 00:00:22,542
From a rock...

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,667
to a wolf...

6
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:29,542
and now, a human.

7
00:00:31,167 --> 00:00:35,542
It had no characteristics of a human.

8
00:00:35,542 --> 00:00:37,708
It was incontinent

9
00:00:37,708 --> 00:00:40,542
and lacked a source of nutrition.

10
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:43,208
As such,

11
00:00:43,208 --> 00:00:45,042
it soon died.

12
00:00:46,708 --> 00:00:48,667
Yet this was no issue.

13
00:00:48,667 --> 00:00:52,708
For this being,
death is but a change of condition.

14
00:00:52,708 --> 00:00:55,375
By now, it had already died six times.

15
00:00:55,375 --> 00:00:59,250
Yet its regeneration mechanics
were functioning just fine.

16
00:01:00,167 --> 00:01:04,208
The first time, it took all of five days
before it came back to life.

17
00:01:04,208 --> 00:01:08,417
By the sixth time, it took only 12 hours.

18
00:01:10,542 --> 00:01:13,833
Pain promotes growth.

19
00:01:13,833 --> 00:01:15,833
There are no meaningless deaths.

20
00:01:57,375 --> 00:01:59,208
It died again.

21
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,458
Yet this was no issue.

22
00:03:31,542 --> 00:03:33,958
TO YOUR ETERNITY

23
00:03:34,417 --> 00:03:38,833
Mom, I'm so hungry
I feel like I'm going to die...

24
00:03:38,833 --> 00:03:41,625
Oh, poor Usatarou.

25
00:03:41,625 --> 00:03:44,208
Mom will make food for you!

26
00:03:44,208 --> 00:03:46,292
It's done! Eat up!

27
00:03:46,292 --> 00:03:47,208
So good!

28
00:03:47,208 --> 00:03:48,250
Mom's cooking is amazing!

29
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:50,083
As expected of Mom!

30
00:03:50,083 --> 00:03:53,167
Oh, thank you!

31
00:03:53,167 --> 00:03:55,750
With this, you are a proper adult.

32
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:57,500
Thanks, Grandma.

33
00:04:07,458 --> 00:04:09,542
What are you looking at, March?

34
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:13,042
Look. What might this be?

35
00:04:13,042 --> 00:04:14,917
Were they born safely?

36
00:04:14,917 --> 00:04:17,583
Yes. Meet the sixth
member of our family, Kanitarou!

37
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:20,416
I had just been thinking we needed a child!

38
00:04:20,416 --> 00:04:22,875
With this, our family has eight people!

39
00:04:22,875 --> 00:04:24,333
That's right.

40
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:28,167
Dearest, a feast in thanks!

41
00:04:28,167 --> 00:04:29,417
Oh, it looks so good!

42
00:04:30,375 --> 00:04:33,875
The food you make is the best, after all.

43
00:04:33,875 --> 00:04:36,833
Aren't you glad you married me?

44
00:04:36,833 --> 00:04:38,792
It's time to eat, March.

45
00:04:38,792 --> 00:04:40,583
Mom! Dad!

46
00:04:40,583 --> 00:04:42,500
Look! It's Kanitarou!

47
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:45,292
Oh, good work!

48
00:04:45,292 --> 00:04:48,333
Sorry for troubling you all the time, Parona.

49
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:49,375
Not at all.

50
00:04:49,375 --> 00:04:52,375
I feel at ease playing with March.

51
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:58,917
Mom...

52
00:04:58,917 --> 00:05:02,792
When will March become an adult?

53
00:05:02,792 --> 00:05:04,542
Are you asking that again?

54
00:05:04,542 --> 00:05:09,083
As I've told you, you need to go to sleep
without wetting the bed 3000 times in a row.

55
00:05:09,083 --> 00:05:10,667
I can't wait for that!

56
00:05:10,667 --> 00:05:14,000
I want to grow up soon and become a mother!

57
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:14,667
Did you know

58
00:05:14,667 --> 00:05:17,625
Ri next door isn't a kid anymore?

59
00:05:17,625 --> 00:05:19,875
She has already removed the paint on her face!

60
00:05:19,875 --> 00:05:21,167
The only kids left in this village

61
00:05:21,167 --> 00:05:23,875
are me, Lisa, and that baby Lala!

62
00:05:23,875 --> 00:05:25,958
It's embarrassing!

63
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:27,125
How about it, Lisa?

64
00:05:27,125 --> 00:05:29,875
Your big sister will feed you next time!

65
00:05:29,875 --> 00:05:31,375
Don't do that.

66
00:05:31,375 --> 00:05:34,625
I'll teach you something nice, March.

67
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:38,833
If you aren't obedient,
you won't become an adult.

68
00:05:38,833 --> 00:05:40,750
Because adults are obedient.

69
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:43,792
What is that supposed to mean?
I don't get it.

70
00:05:46,375 --> 00:05:50,500
EPISODE TWO: A DISOBEDIENT GIRL

71
00:06:13,167 --> 00:06:16,583
That bow is too heavy for you.

72
00:06:16,583 --> 00:06:19,083
Don't worry. You'll get good someday.

73
00:06:19,083 --> 00:06:20,958
We'll help out, too.

74
00:06:20,958 --> 00:06:22,917
Let's all train hard together.

75
00:06:24,708 --> 00:06:26,208
Thanks, everyone.

76
00:06:26,792 --> 00:06:28,958
Where is Dad?

77
00:06:28,958 --> 00:06:31,750
Dad is busy working today.

78
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:32,833
But...

79
00:06:32,833 --> 00:06:34,292
You can't be selfish.

80
00:06:39,917 --> 00:06:41,875
I wonder what that sound might be?

81
00:06:41,875 --> 00:06:43,292
No idea...

82
00:06:43,292 --> 00:06:44,708
March.

83
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:49,625
Big sister!

84
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,542
Where are we going?

85
00:06:53,542 --> 00:06:55,583
I found a really nice place.

86
00:06:55,583 --> 00:06:57,333
Let's go play there.

87
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:59,375
What are you doing?

88
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:11,792
She is a village girl, isn't she?

89
00:07:11,792 --> 00:07:14,750
Did you not hear the order to assemble?

90
00:07:18,208 --> 00:07:20,875
Rejoice, all of you.

91
00:07:20,875 --> 00:07:24,625
This village was lucky to be selected this year.

92
00:07:24,625 --> 00:07:28,417
The ritual to thank the deity
who blesses Ninannah with peace and prosperity,

93
00:07:28,417 --> 00:07:30,917
The Spirit Bear,

94
00:07:30,917 --> 00:07:33,417
shall occur in this village.

95
00:07:33,417 --> 00:07:36,917
We shall offer
an unsullied girl to the Spirit Bear.

96
00:07:36,917 --> 00:07:39,292
The selection shall be carried out by us Yanome,

97
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:41,917
as dictated by tradition.

98
00:07:42,583 --> 00:07:44,167
Let's see.

99
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:14,792
This child.

100
00:08:15,792 --> 00:08:17,000
Congratulations, March!

101
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,875
Congratulations!

102
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:20,375
Thank you very much.

103
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:22,500
Thank you very much.

104
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:23,750
Congratulations?

105
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:26,042
For what?

106
00:08:26,042 --> 00:08:30,375
You've been chosen
for a very prestigious position, March.

107
00:08:30,375 --> 00:08:31,917
Prestigious?

108
00:08:37,707 --> 00:08:39,332
We're sorry, March!

109
00:08:39,332 --> 00:08:42,249
W... What happened, Mom?

110
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:44,250
You are to die,

111
00:08:45,083 --> 00:08:46,542
March.

112
00:08:47,708 --> 00:08:53,542
For everyone's sake, you shall be
the sacrificial lamb for the Spirit Bear.

113
00:08:53,542 --> 00:08:55,542
Sacrifice?

114
00:08:55,542 --> 00:08:58,625
I am Hayase of the Yanome.

115
00:08:58,625 --> 00:09:01,000
I have been assigned to watch over March

116
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,875
until the completion of the ritual.

117
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:05,292
Please stand down.

118
00:09:05,292 --> 00:09:08,083
No men, even her father, may approach her.

119
00:09:08,083 --> 00:09:10,875
I must ensure that she remains pure.

120
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:14,250
Then, as for the ritual's schedule...

121
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:15,917
A day before the departure,

122
00:09:15,917 --> 00:09:18,792
a banquet will be held.

123
00:09:18,792 --> 00:09:23,250
Families and friends may bid farewell to her.

124
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:26,375
Over the next three days,
we shall climb the mountain.

125
00:09:26,375 --> 00:09:29,375
We will escort her carefully,

126
00:09:29,375 --> 00:09:32,708
so have confidence that she will be safe.

127
00:09:32,708 --> 00:09:36,708
We will have March rest on top of the altar.

128
00:09:36,708 --> 00:09:40,542
We shall return immediately
without waiting for the Spirit Bear to descend.

129
00:09:40,542 --> 00:09:44,208
If anything remains after a year,
we shall collect it

130
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:46,250
and return it to you.

131
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:48,583
March doesn't want to die.

132
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:54,583
Dying means that I won't become an adult, right?

133
00:09:54,583 --> 00:09:56,000
Yes.

134
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,667
So I don't want to die.

135
00:09:58,667 --> 00:10:00,292
That's too bad.

136
00:10:02,458 --> 00:10:05,375
Why are you deciding everything for March?

137
00:10:05,375 --> 00:10:07,083
That's how it is.

138
00:10:07,083 --> 00:10:09,250
What is that supposed to mean?

139
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:11,917
No! No! No! I don't want to die!

140
00:10:11,917 --> 00:10:14,708
Why do I have to die?

141
00:10:14,708 --> 00:10:17,500
Why is March the only one who can't grow up?

142
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,042
Why...

143
00:10:19,042 --> 00:10:20,667
March!

144
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:27,792
Be obedient.

145
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:41,208
-March, eat these.
-These are for you, too.

146
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:45,625
Lala.

147
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:48,083
March, I made this for you.

148
00:10:48,083 --> 00:10:50,375
Wear it on your last day, all right?

149
00:10:50,375 --> 00:10:52,000
Thanks.

150
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,333
I'll do my best.

151
00:11:01,292 --> 00:11:05,542
Does your job also include
watching me when I use the bathroom?

152
00:11:05,542 --> 00:11:11,208
I am ensuring that you stay safe
until the final day.

153
00:11:11,208 --> 00:11:13,625
That's right. You need to make sure
that I don't run away.

154
00:11:13,625 --> 00:11:15,417
Let me give you a warning.

155
00:11:15,417 --> 00:11:16,792
If you run away,

156
00:11:16,792 --> 00:11:19,375
Lala may be the one to die instead.

157
00:11:19,375 --> 00:11:21,500
And if Lala runs away, too?

158
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:24,083
We'll take the kid who can't run away.

159
00:11:25,792 --> 00:11:27,875
What's wrong?

160
00:11:32,917 --> 00:11:34,250
There, there...

161
00:11:36,417 --> 00:11:39,292
There, there...

162
00:12:25,417 --> 00:12:27,958
You've done well, March.

163
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:33,083
You've stayed obedient until now. Good job.

164
00:12:34,208 --> 00:12:36,417
There is a saying.

165
00:12:36,417 --> 00:12:39,750
The world beyond death is one of freedom.

166
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:42,833
You may do anything and become anything.

167
00:12:42,833 --> 00:12:46,875
There you could be the adult
you could not be here.

168
00:13:04,708 --> 00:13:05,833
An arrow...

169
00:13:07,167 --> 00:13:08,750
She ran away!

170
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:09,958
Wait...

171
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:14,958
Ms. Hayase!

172
00:13:15,542 --> 00:13:16,542
Go after March!

173
00:13:16,542 --> 00:13:17,792
Don't let her get away!

174
00:13:37,208 --> 00:13:39,667
She's gone! Look over there!

175
00:13:39,667 --> 00:13:42,042
-She's not here!
-Look harder!

176
00:13:56,917 --> 00:13:59,792
I'm sorry, Dad...

177
00:13:59,792 --> 00:14:02,875
I couldn't be obedient...

178
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:36,250
There she is!

179
00:14:39,917 --> 00:14:41,583
What is that?

180
00:14:41,583 --> 00:14:42,833
Wait for me!

181
00:14:48,542 --> 00:14:49,708
What...

182
00:14:53,667 --> 00:14:55,792
What is this thing?

183
00:15:14,208 --> 00:15:16,583
Um...

184
00:15:24,083 --> 00:15:25,875
Where are you going?

185
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:33,208
Take March with you.

186
00:15:47,667 --> 00:15:49,208
I see.

187
00:15:49,208 --> 00:15:52,333
Did you intend to fake March's death with these?

188
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:55,375
I've understood what you wanted to do.

189
00:15:55,375 --> 00:15:57,625
Play pretend, it seems.

190
00:15:58,667 --> 00:16:01,208
Don't misunderstand.

191
00:16:01,208 --> 00:16:04,042
The one to punish you will not be me,

192
00:16:04,042 --> 00:16:06,375
but your own people of Ninannah.

193
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:11,500
Where is March?

194
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,208
Um... Well...

195
00:16:13,208 --> 00:16:14,667
Did she escape?

196
00:16:14,667 --> 00:16:17,083
We should go back
to the village and get another...

197
00:16:17,083 --> 00:16:19,917
Why do such a shameful thing
when we could just find her?

198
00:16:19,917 --> 00:16:21,500
We're going to go find her! Now!

199
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:24,958
No! Wait! There's a monster!

200
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:26,333
A monster?

201
00:16:29,458 --> 00:16:31,417
What are you?

202
00:16:31,417 --> 00:16:33,958
You looked like a pile of bones at first.

203
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:35,750
But then you wiggled around

204
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:37,958
and then you came back to life!

205
00:16:37,958 --> 00:16:41,458
One time, my big sister stepped on a bug,
but then it was still alive!

206
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:43,333
We were really surprised!

207
00:16:43,333 --> 00:16:45,792
That's called...

208
00:16:45,792 --> 00:16:48,958
Im... Imm...

209
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:50,833
Immortal, right?

210
00:16:50,833 --> 00:16:52,833
That's what my big sister taught me.

211
00:16:55,833 --> 00:16:58,208
By the way, where did you come from?

212
00:16:58,208 --> 00:17:00,167
You're definitely not from Ninannah.

213
00:17:00,167 --> 00:17:02,208
You don't look like you're from Yanome, either.

214
00:17:04,416 --> 00:17:06,207
What's your name?

215
00:17:06,208 --> 00:17:08,625
I'm March!

216
00:17:10,916 --> 00:17:14,749
Hey! Say something! Can't you speak?

217
00:17:26,291 --> 00:17:28,541
Oh, that fruit looks sweet.

218
00:17:28,541 --> 00:17:32,083
I see. You must be hungry.

219
00:17:32,083 --> 00:17:33,292
I'll get it.

220
00:17:33,292 --> 00:17:35,750
Leave it to me. I'm good at climbing trees!

221
00:17:37,375 --> 00:17:38,875
Here.

222
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,208
What? You can't be serious...

223
00:17:48,208 --> 00:17:49,750
You look so pitiful...

224
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:52,250
Did your parents never teach you?

225
00:17:57,417 --> 00:18:01,417
Here. You hold it with your hands and eat it.

226
00:18:05,958 --> 00:18:08,667
Hey! How could you?

227
00:18:08,667 --> 00:18:10,167
Good grief.

228
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:14,375
That's not nice! That was March's share!

229
00:18:14,375 --> 00:18:16,167
Stop it!

230
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:19,500
No! These are March's!

231
00:19:22,083 --> 00:19:24,542
Did you want to eat that much?

232
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:30,458
You see, when someone
you don't know does nice things for you,

233
00:19:30,458 --> 00:19:33,167
you have to say, "Thank you".

234
00:19:33,167 --> 00:19:35,750
Can you say it? Here, "Thank you".

235
00:19:40,875 --> 00:19:46,500
Thank... you...

236
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:49,542
Thank... you...

237
00:19:49,542 --> 00:19:52,708
Thank... you...

238
00:19:57,542 --> 00:20:00,708
Hey! Don't run off like that!

239
00:20:15,417 --> 00:20:17,125
Are you sleeping?

240
00:20:35,917 --> 00:20:37,500
Mom! Dad!

241
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:40,208
March came back!

242
00:20:40,208 --> 00:20:41,667
March!

243
00:20:44,708 --> 00:20:47,833
Huh? Where is Lisa?

244
00:21:13,833 --> 00:21:16,917
It's your fault, March.

245
00:21:17,708 --> 00:21:19,375
Big sister...

246
00:21:20,042 --> 00:21:22,083
Because you ran away.

247
00:21:22,083 --> 00:21:24,167
Two people became sacrifices.

248
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:10,000
Oh? Why did you follow me?

249
00:22:55,292 --> 00:22:56,333
Goodness.

250
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:59,917
March is not your mom, you know?

251
00:24:30,458 --> 00:24:33,125
A boy who knows nothing...

252
00:24:33,125 --> 00:24:38,125
and March, a girl who wants to be a mother...

253
00:24:38,125 --> 00:24:42,583
Their lives gradually began to intertwine.

254
00:24:42,583 --> 00:24:46,750
Parona, who fights to save March's life,

255
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:49,917
the persistent Hayase...

256
00:24:49,917 --> 00:24:51,417
and...

257
00:24:51,417 --> 00:24:54,917
"EPISODE THREE A MINOR EVOLUTION"
a giant shadow that suddenly appears.
