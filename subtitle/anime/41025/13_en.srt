1
00:00:05,125 --> 00:00:08,875
Why... am I who I am?

2
00:00:12,042 --> 00:00:16,208
I... couldn't do anything...

3
00:00:18,667 --> 00:00:21,458
Gugu... I'm sorry...

4
00:00:24,583 --> 00:00:26,792
It's getting late...

5
00:02:00,583 --> 00:02:02,958
TO YOUR ETERNITY

6
00:02:04,417 --> 00:02:08,750
For four and a half days 
since leaving his family,

7
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:12,792
Fushi walked silently.

8
00:02:12,792 --> 00:02:16,125
He displayed many emotions on his path.

9
00:02:17,266 --> 00:02:21,686
He was certainly trying to deal 
with all the feelings welling up within him.

10
00:02:23,583 --> 00:02:25,750
Following Gugu's death,

11
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:28,917
he seems to have gained something less visible.

12
00:02:30,917 --> 00:02:33,750
Show yourself, black guy.

13
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:37,292
Black guy? Is he referring to me?

14
00:02:39,833 --> 00:02:41,583
What is it?

15
00:02:41,583 --> 00:02:44,458
This is the first time he has called out to me.

16
00:02:44,458 --> 00:02:48,458
EPISODE 13 ASPIRING TO GO HIGHER

17
00:02:49,208 --> 00:02:52,292
What should I do now?

18
00:02:52,292 --> 00:02:54,042
Continue on like this.

19
00:02:54,042 --> 00:02:59,875
Become stronger in order to reclaim
what was stolen from you.

20
00:02:59,875 --> 00:03:03,000
What... What am I?

21
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,500
What do you want from me?

22
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:08,125
As we spoke of previously,

23
00:03:08,125 --> 00:03:11,458
you exist to collect information on

24
00:03:11,458 --> 00:03:14,000
and to protect this region.

25
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,167
I created you for this purpose.

26
00:03:17,167 --> 00:03:20,625
You could say I am your father.

27
00:03:20,625 --> 00:03:23,958
No. You're not my father.

28
00:03:23,958 --> 00:03:25,833
To me, a father is...

29
00:03:28,667 --> 00:03:30,708
What's wrong?

30
00:03:35,667 --> 00:03:38,208
Why am I the only one to live?

31
00:03:38,208 --> 00:03:42,167
Why did Gugu have to die?

32
00:03:42,167 --> 00:03:45,000
It's a matter of your natures.

33
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,167
I don't understand.

34
00:03:47,167 --> 00:03:50,208
It's too early for you to understand.

35
00:03:50,208 --> 00:03:53,750
But I am happy 
that you have become capable of doubt...

36
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:56,500
Don't try to fool me. Tell me everything!

37
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:01,792
Things will collapse. 
And that is why you are necessary.

38
00:04:01,792 --> 00:04:05,958
You are the one special existence in this world.

39
00:04:05,958 --> 00:04:07,167
The enemy...

40
00:04:07,167 --> 00:04:11,333
The Knockers wish to control you.

41
00:04:11,333 --> 00:04:12,833
The Knockers...

42
00:04:12,833 --> 00:04:15,875
The Knockers won't come if I'm not me, right?

43
00:04:15,875 --> 00:04:17,625
I wish.

44
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:20,208
Let's find out.

45
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:43,083
They won't give up on you that easily.

46
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:47,583
If the Knockers were to come now,
you wouldn't stand a chance.

47
00:04:47,583 --> 00:04:51,792
And if you keep getting defeated,
you will eventually revert...

48
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:55,125
into a sphere.

49
00:04:55,125 --> 00:04:58,750
Once that happens,

50
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:00,750
you will never be able to become as you are now.

51
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:04,625
I feel that is more of a problem
for you than it is for me.

52
00:05:04,625 --> 00:05:07,833
If you can say that much,
then why don't you fight?

53
00:05:07,833 --> 00:05:11,708
You're strong enough to control me, aren't you?

54
00:05:11,708 --> 00:05:14,917
That certainly is true.

55
00:05:14,917 --> 00:05:20,083
Yet, although I can control your body,
I cannot control your mind.

56
00:05:20,083 --> 00:05:21,958
Knockers...

57
00:05:21,958 --> 00:05:28,667
Their goal is to destroy us,
and they will not stop until we are annihilated.

58
00:05:28,667 --> 00:05:32,750
And the only one 
who can stop them is you, not me.

59
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:35,500
I will eventually vanish.

60
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,375
It is essential that by that time,

61
00:05:37,375 --> 00:05:42,083
you become capable 
of fighting alone against the enemy.

62
00:05:42,083 --> 00:05:46,208
That is how my goal 
will eventually be accomplished.

63
00:05:46,208 --> 00:05:47,583
I don't care...

64
00:05:47,583 --> 00:05:49,208
about your selfish goals!

65
00:05:52,215 --> 00:05:56,632
Good grief. You've grown up
to be quite troublesome.

66
00:05:57,875 --> 00:05:59,792
Darn it...

67
00:05:59,792 --> 00:06:03,375
No matter what I do, Gugu will not come back.

68
00:06:03,375 --> 00:06:05,958
So it doesn't matter anymore...

69
00:06:05,958 --> 00:06:07,583
Whatever happens,

70
00:06:07,583 --> 00:06:09,500
or whatever I become.

71
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:12,250
Can you hold yourself to that?

72
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:29,667
This smell... Why?

73
00:06:34,833 --> 00:06:37,208
-Pioran?
-Hi.

74
00:06:39,042 --> 00:06:41,458
I realized.

75
00:06:41,458 --> 00:06:45,958
I brought you to Takunaha to help you,

76
00:06:45,958 --> 00:06:50,000
but ultimately, I couldn't do anything.

77
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,958
So I'll continue to travel with you.

78
00:06:53,958 --> 00:06:57,667
What... But what about 
Grandpa Beer and the others?

79
00:06:57,667 --> 00:07:02,042
Don't worry. I told them.

80
00:07:02,042 --> 00:07:06,667
Rynn and Shin will help keep the store afloat.

81
00:07:06,667 --> 00:07:10,958
Rynn understood what happened.

82
00:07:10,958 --> 00:07:15,458
That's why I think she was able to send me off.

83
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:22,042
Pioran. Go back.

84
00:07:22,042 --> 00:07:27,500
What? Are you going to reject
the proposal of this innocent old lady?

85
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,917
That thing will come for me again.

86
00:07:29,917 --> 00:07:31,750
It's too dangerous.

87
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:34,083
I've been thinking.

88
00:07:34,083 --> 00:07:38,625
What meaning can I find
in the little life left in me?

89
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:44,333
So I thought I should support you,
even if only for a moment.

90
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:46,958
That's what I think.

91
00:07:46,958 --> 00:07:49,417
-I'll take you back home.
-No! No!

92
00:07:49,417 --> 00:07:52,042
-They need you back there, Pioran!
-No! No...

93
00:07:52,042 --> 00:07:53,250
Ow!

94
00:07:55,167 --> 00:07:58,083
Why won't you listen to me?

95
00:07:58,083 --> 00:08:03,042
I don't want anyone to cry!
I don't want to see them suffer!

96
00:08:03,042 --> 00:08:06,542
So please... Go back home! For my sake!

97
00:08:06,542 --> 00:08:08,792
Shut up! It's my life!

98
00:08:08,792 --> 00:08:11,167
Let me do what I want with it!

99
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,667
Fine.

100
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,542
Here. Have a sweet potato.

101
00:08:31,542 --> 00:08:32,875
I don't want it.

102
00:08:42,832 --> 00:08:44,166
Have some tea.

103
00:08:44,167 --> 00:08:45,417
I don't need it!

104
00:08:46,917 --> 00:08:48,250
Have some fish.

105
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:50,208
I said I don't need it!

106
00:08:50,208 --> 00:08:52,583
It's cold, right?

107
00:08:58,917 --> 00:09:00,167
Pioran.

108
00:09:00,167 --> 00:09:02,500
Promise me something.

109
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,875
What is it?

110
00:09:04,917 --> 00:09:06,917
Don't die.

111
00:09:09,125 --> 00:09:10,542
Mm.

112
00:09:14,792 --> 00:09:15,917
Look.

113
00:09:15,917 --> 00:09:17,250
A town.

114
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:19,917
I'm feeling hungry.

115
00:09:19,917 --> 00:09:22,250
Why don't we stop there for a bit?

116
00:09:23,667 --> 00:09:24,958
Pioran!

117
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,458
-Pioran, let's hurry up and leave.
-Welcome.

118
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:35,708
I haven't had noodles in so long. Delicious!

119
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:37,625
If they were to come,

120
00:09:37,625 --> 00:09:40,083
I wouldn't be able to protect this village.

121
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:43,833
All right. We'll leave in a bit.

122
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:45,792
Mister, got any beer?

123
00:09:45,792 --> 00:09:46,708
Sure do!

124
00:09:46,708 --> 00:09:48,208
Pioran!

125
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:56,792
Where are the Knockers right now?

126
00:09:56,792 --> 00:09:59,917
At a point six kilometers northwest of here.

127
00:09:59,917 --> 00:10:04,917
But for these past four days,
they've been buried underground. So I haven't been able to determine their movements.

128
00:10:04,917 --> 00:10:06,375
Detect?

129
00:10:06,375 --> 00:10:09,000
Are you always aware of where they are?

130
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,333
They feel like bugs crawling on your skin.

131
00:10:12,333 --> 00:10:15,708
As small eggs, you cannot notice them.

132
00:10:15,708 --> 00:10:19,542
But once they hatch, you are subject to unease.

133
00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:23,042
Say it in a way I can understand.

134
00:10:23,042 --> 00:10:25,292
Who are you talking to?

135
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:28,042
Um...

136
00:10:29,542 --> 00:10:31,750
This is for you.

137
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:33,250
Fushi.

138
00:10:35,292 --> 00:10:37,583
Say anything.

139
00:10:38,625 --> 00:10:40,958
A black-hooded man?

140
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:44,750
And he told you to become more powerful

141
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:47,250
in order to repel those Knockers?

142
00:10:48,208 --> 00:10:51,250
So? What do you want to do?

143
00:10:53,042 --> 00:10:56,333
I don't want to follow his orders blindly.

144
00:10:56,333 --> 00:10:59,750
But if the Knockers were to attack again...

145
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:04,083
I would be the only one there to protect Pioran.

146
00:11:04,083 --> 00:11:08,333
Like he said, I can't win as I am now.

147
00:11:09,333 --> 00:11:11,958
Then... I have no choice but to get stronger.

148
00:11:13,409 --> 00:11:18,492
That bastard! He led me to Pioran
so I would come to this conclusion!

149
00:11:19,875 --> 00:11:21,417
Fushi.

150
00:11:21,417 --> 00:11:24,667
You know, 
I don't think that you need to protect me.

151
00:11:26,625 --> 00:11:30,958
I'm fine living a fickle reed's life.

152
00:11:33,792 --> 00:11:36,667
Is she really fine with that?

153
00:11:36,667 --> 00:11:39,458
I feel like I'm forgetting something.

154
00:11:40,375 --> 00:11:42,458
Those fruits look delicious!

155
00:11:42,458 --> 00:11:45,292
Fushi, why not climb and get some?

156
00:11:45,292 --> 00:11:47,500
You don't have to do that.

157
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,542
Look.

158
00:11:48,542 --> 00:11:53,417
Ew... I'm not eating that.

159
00:11:53,417 --> 00:11:55,292
It can't be helped, then.

160
00:11:58,667 --> 00:12:01,208
Pathetic.

161
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:05,458
Why not assume March's form
and climb, like you always do?

162
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:06,583
March?

163
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:10,792
You know who March is, right?

164
00:12:10,792 --> 00:12:13,875
That little girl...

165
00:12:13,875 --> 00:12:15,875
Who?

166
00:12:15,875 --> 00:12:19,125
Haven't you taken her from multiple times?

167
00:12:19,125 --> 00:12:22,583
Remember! I won't let you say you forgot!

168
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:36,458
I... I remember. 
I have memories of climbing trees...

169
00:12:36,458 --> 00:12:38,417
Fushi! Go ahead!

170
00:12:38,417 --> 00:12:40,208
Fushi! Give me a stick!

171
00:12:41,042 --> 00:12:43,250
Surely, I...

172
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:45,667
A part of you was stolen by them.

173
00:12:45,667 --> 00:12:48,083
The Knockers took away March.

174
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,708
A person... who gave me a lot of things...

175
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,917
Here. Say "thank you".

176
00:12:55,917 --> 00:12:58,167
What a strange puppy.

177
00:12:58,167 --> 00:13:02,333
If you become an adult,
you'll know a lot of things, right?

178
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:05,958
That was March... right?

179
00:13:07,708 --> 00:13:11,542
That... was something very important.

180
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:14,875
Have you finally realized?

181
00:13:14,875 --> 00:13:16,250
It doesn't matter.

182
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:20,042
You cannot even remember what you've lost.

183
00:13:25,725 --> 00:13:31,100
I see. So the enemy can even 
steal your memories...

184
00:13:31,125 --> 00:13:34,583
So if you were to be "killed" 
while in Gugu's form,

185
00:13:34,583 --> 00:13:37,458
his memories would disappear.

186
00:13:40,417 --> 00:13:43,333
He would essentially die twice.

187
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:47,083
Rynn, Grandpa Beer,

188
00:13:47,083 --> 00:13:48,833
Parona of the Ninannah...

189
00:13:48,833 --> 00:13:50,833
And me...

190
00:13:50,833 --> 00:13:56,250
Is being forgotten how we will truly die?

191
00:13:57,583 --> 00:13:59,375
I won't let that happen.

192
00:13:59,375 --> 00:14:02,333
I'll become stronger.

193
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:07,875
Now that I've decided, I need to think.

194
00:14:07,875 --> 00:14:10,833
Even if this is exactly 
what the black-hooded guy wants.

195
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:15,375
You're capable of replicating stimuli
by experiencing pain therefrom.

196
00:14:16,625 --> 00:14:17,958
Pain...

197
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:20,083
So I just need to apply stimuli to myself.

198
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:21,333
It's simple.

199
00:14:22,292 --> 00:14:27,417
But turning myself into a rock 
wouldn't be helpful. I would lose consciousness.

200
00:14:27,417 --> 00:14:30,333
The problem is living things.

201
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:33,792
I can't replicate living things
as long as they are alive.

202
00:14:33,792 --> 00:14:35,958
-What an unpleasant feeling...
-Oh, Kaniflower!

203
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:37,833
This stuff is tasty.

204
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:40,667
Their eyes are filled with bugs.
So you can't eat them.

205
00:14:40,667 --> 00:14:45,583
But the flower part is tasty.
We'll make a salad later.

206
00:14:45,583 --> 00:14:48,542
And we'll boil it alive with plenty of salt.

207
00:14:49,458 --> 00:14:51,375
What's wrong, Fushi?

208
00:14:51,375 --> 00:14:57,042
When I'm nearby, their feelings are transmitted to me. Vicarious pain and unease.

209
00:14:57,042 --> 00:15:00,583
What? Has it always been like that for you?

210
00:15:01,875 --> 00:15:07,250
Yes. So whenever we prepared fish or crayfish,
I always had Gugu do the dirty stuff...

211
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:09,833
I see.

212
00:15:09,833 --> 00:15:11,792
All right. It's done.

213
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,833
-Yummy!
-Tasty!

214
00:15:14,833 --> 00:15:17,750
I'm not prepared to turn into a crab...

215
00:15:20,625 --> 00:15:23,583
All I can make is this dead husk.

216
00:15:23,583 --> 00:15:26,708
I could probably make Gugu too.

217
00:15:26,708 --> 00:15:29,833
A cold and unmoving Gugu...

218
00:15:31,542 --> 00:15:32,958
Fushi.

219
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:35,583
How did you defeat

220
00:15:35,583 --> 00:15:37,417
the Knocker when you fought it last time?

221
00:15:39,083 --> 00:15:42,167
Actually... I don't really know.

222
00:15:42,167 --> 00:15:44,292
Gugu did some stuff with his fire,

223
00:15:44,292 --> 00:15:47,917
then when it went into the water, it exploded.

224
00:15:47,917 --> 00:15:49,208
That's it!

225
00:15:49,208 --> 00:15:52,500
Heated rocks will break if cooled quickly.

226
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:07,625
We were successful back then.

227
00:16:07,625 --> 00:16:10,042
But it's hard to say 
if we'll be as lucky next time...

228
00:16:10,042 --> 00:16:13,042
We'll be dead if we get thrown off...

229
00:16:13,042 --> 00:16:16,792
There won't always be a water source nearby too.

230
00:16:16,792 --> 00:16:20,500
We must think of an adaptable tactic.

231
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:23,792
Oh, for that, I know a great place!

232
00:16:25,833 --> 00:16:27,750
From the port ahead,

233
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:31,292
there's a ship departing for Sarlnein.

234
00:16:31,292 --> 00:16:34,583
That place is an animal paradise.

235
00:16:34,583 --> 00:16:36,458
People don't come close.

236
00:16:36,458 --> 00:16:39,625
You'll be able 
to gain plenty of techniques there.

237
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:43,083
A ship... But if the Knockers were to attack...

238
00:16:43,083 --> 00:16:45,083
Show a bit of restraint!

239
00:16:45,083 --> 00:16:49,208
If you worry about everything,
you'll never be able to get anywhere!

240
00:16:51,292 --> 00:16:52,417
I understand.

241
00:16:53,042 --> 00:16:54,250
Let's go.

242
00:16:59,417 --> 00:17:01,917
Here it is. This is the ship.

243
00:17:01,917 --> 00:17:05,000
Miss, this ship is at maximum capacity.

244
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,541
Let me guide you to the other ship.

245
00:17:07,541 --> 00:17:08,916
Please come this way.

246
00:17:08,916 --> 00:17:10,707
I'll take care of the donkey.

247
00:17:10,708 --> 00:17:12,000
Thank you.

248
00:17:13,416 --> 00:17:15,332
Ah, let's get some sleep.

249
00:17:15,333 --> 00:17:17,667
Ladies, this way, please.

250
00:17:18,625 --> 00:17:20,833
Is that a rule now?

251
00:17:20,833 --> 00:17:24,041
Apologies. This area is quite unsafe.

252
00:17:24,041 --> 00:17:26,582
See you later, Fushi! When we land.

253
00:17:31,667 --> 00:17:34,000
And you go here.

254
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,500
Over here.

255
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:36,500
Get in!

256
00:17:38,333 --> 00:17:40,500
-Curse you, let me out!
-Get back here!

257
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,625
I'll begin distributing tickets!

258
00:17:42,625 --> 00:17:44,250
Hold out one hand!

259
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:50,500
Your turn.

260
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:57,375
Next.

261
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:01,083
Next.

262
00:18:02,875 --> 00:18:04,333
Pioran!

263
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:06,625
Welcome, prisoners!

264
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:09,417
As of today, you are all family!

265
00:18:09,417 --> 00:18:11,000
We're heading to the only place in this world

266
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:16,375
that would accept the likes of you.

267
00:18:16,375 --> 00:18:20,125
And there, the end of your lives will begin.

268
00:18:20,125 --> 00:18:21,750
Welcome

269
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:24,667
to Jananda, the paradise of the underworld!

270
00:18:36,292 --> 00:18:38,417
What in the world is going on?

271
00:18:42,958 --> 00:18:44,708
Where's Pioran?

272
00:18:48,417 --> 00:18:51,583
Hey, you. Where are your shackles?

273
00:18:52,375 --> 00:18:54,250
No brand either? The heck is this?

274
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:58,583
Don't tell me... 
Shaba brought you here accidentally?

275
00:18:58,583 --> 00:19:00,750
I'm sorry, sir!

276
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:03,125
It's my fault!

277
00:19:03,125 --> 00:19:06,000
Is that so. Be more careful next time.

278
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,833
Trust is important in this line of business.

279
00:19:08,833 --> 00:19:10,875
Yes! I'll send him back right away!

280
00:19:12,042 --> 00:19:13,292
This way.

281
00:19:19,042 --> 00:19:20,417
Where's Pioran?

282
00:19:20,417 --> 00:19:22,458
The woman who was with me?

283
00:19:22,458 --> 00:19:23,500
Who knows?

284
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:26,125
She's probably already been taken care of.

285
00:19:26,917 --> 00:19:28,125
Don't worry.

286
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:32,417
Everyone who comes here 
eventually comes to smile.

287
00:19:32,417 --> 00:19:35,000
In what way, though?

288
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:40,167
Because they are happy? 
Or because they can't help but pretend to?

289
00:19:41,875 --> 00:19:42,917
Hey, wait!

290
00:19:43,708 --> 00:19:45,917
You can't just run all over the place!

291
00:19:50,042 --> 00:19:51,708
What a pain.

292
00:20:03,208 --> 00:20:04,792
She's on the other side.

293
00:20:07,458 --> 00:20:09,917
Where's the entrance?

294
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:11,292
I can't find it.

295
00:20:13,375 --> 00:20:15,500
I can't dig a hole.

296
00:20:16,875 --> 00:20:19,333
I should be able to use this to climb over...

297
00:20:39,083 --> 00:20:40,292
Don't look!

298
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:44,792
He..llo...

299
00:20:46,208 --> 00:20:48,500
Did you see that?

300
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:49,708
We saw it!

301
00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:51,417
You were amazing!

302
00:20:53,033 --> 00:20:55,199
Should we keep it a secret?

303
00:20:59,833 --> 00:21:01,958
Let me borrow that bow.

304
00:21:03,458 --> 00:21:04,458
Here.

305
00:21:07,042 --> 00:21:08,583
How does this work again?

306
00:21:10,083 --> 00:21:11,542
Ah, like this.

307
00:21:11,542 --> 00:21:15,208
If I can get my hands on that bird,
I can cross the wall.

308
00:21:15,208 --> 00:21:16,667
I have no choice but to do it.

309
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:18,292
All right.

310
00:21:19,083 --> 00:21:20,750
No, it's not all right!

311
00:21:22,292 --> 00:21:24,125
What are you doing?

312
00:21:24,125 --> 00:21:26,417
This is my partner.

313
00:21:26,417 --> 00:21:28,625
You can't do things like that.

314
00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:30,817
Give my bow back.

315
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,208
Hey, wait!

316
00:21:37,208 --> 00:21:41,500
If you're all alone,
they'll turn you into a guinea pig!

317
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:44,208
All right. So tell me.

318
00:21:44,208 --> 00:21:46,792
How do I get across that wall?

319
00:21:47,708 --> 00:21:49,583
No idea.

320
00:21:49,583 --> 00:21:50,458
Me neither.

321
00:21:50,458 --> 00:21:52,208
Same.

322
00:21:52,208 --> 00:21:55,417
You're looking for your friend, Pioran, right?

323
00:21:55,417 --> 00:21:57,333
I hate to break it to you,

324
00:21:57,333 --> 00:22:00,875
but she can't leave this place regardless.

325
00:22:01,583 --> 00:22:07,208
This island houses
the worst criminals from all over the world.

326
00:22:07,208 --> 00:22:09,583
In other words, it's a prison island.

327
00:22:09,583 --> 00:22:11,875
Once you're marked a prisoner,

328
00:22:11,875 --> 00:22:14,750
you'll never be able to leave this place.

329
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:17,042
They mark everyone with a brand 
in the palm of their hands.

330
00:22:17,042 --> 00:22:19,458
It's the mark of a prisoner.

331
00:22:19,458 --> 00:22:21,333
As long as she has that,

332
00:22:21,333 --> 00:22:23,792
she's a resident of that island.

333
00:22:23,792 --> 00:22:27,250
What prisoner? 
You were the one who brought us here!

334
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:29,458
Sorry, my bad! 
I must have gotten the wrong person!

335
00:22:29,458 --> 00:22:30,625
I swear...

336
00:22:30,625 --> 00:22:33,417
Stop playing dumb! As if I would buy that!

337
00:22:38,958 --> 00:22:41,625
Fine. Then, as an apology,

338
00:22:41,625 --> 00:22:47,125
I'll tell you the one and only way
to grant your wish.

339
00:22:50,458 --> 00:22:51,875
This is it.

340
00:22:53,417 --> 00:22:56,375
You must achieve victory in this arena.

341
00:24:31,786 --> 00:24:36,042
The land of abnormality 
and lawlessness, Jananda.

342
00:24:36,042 --> 00:24:40,667
A place where prisoners
fight to the death for their wishes.

343
00:24:41,708 --> 00:24:43,667
Fushi's immortal body

344
00:24:43,667 --> 00:24:47,917
has granted hope to the five children.

345
00:24:47,917 --> 00:24:50,833
Fushi has yet to notice

346
00:24:50,833 --> 00:24:53,750
"EPISODE 14 JANANDA: ISLAND OF THE FREE"
the quiet footsteps from the past creeping up.
