1
00:00:01,375 --> 00:00:07,250
During the four years of living 
with his family day by day,

2
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:11,083
Fushi grew like a human being.

3
00:00:12,583 --> 00:00:16,207
Upon Rynn's invitation,

4
00:00:16,207 --> 00:00:22,083
Fushi and Gugu head 
to attend Rynn's 16th birthday party.

5
00:00:24,833 --> 00:00:26,125
I...

6
00:00:31,958 --> 00:00:33,125
However...

7
00:02:02,299 --> 00:02:04,882
TO YOUR ETERNITY

8
00:02:05,958 --> 00:02:08,250
The "Knockers" are here.

9
00:02:13,417 --> 00:02:16,667
Its core is within the earth.

10
00:02:16,667 --> 00:02:20,292
They've laid their roots in the vicinity.

11
00:02:20,292 --> 00:02:23,167
They'll destroy this area soon.

12
00:02:27,917 --> 00:02:30,417
-What's going on?
-I'm scared!

13
00:02:31,208 --> 00:02:33,125
Everyone! Outside!

14
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:38,583
Take Myrr!

15
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:41,083
You should run too!

16
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:49,458
Go! While you can...

17
00:02:50,125 --> 00:02:54,208
EPISODE 12: AWAKENING

18
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:59,125
Gugu!

19
00:03:02,917 --> 00:03:06,125
Someone... Someone help!

20
00:03:06,125 --> 00:03:09,625
What is this? It's all sticky.

21
00:03:10,833 --> 00:03:12,417
Is it alive?

22
00:03:17,708 --> 00:03:19,167
Grab on!

23
00:03:29,583 --> 00:03:30,958
Are you all right?

24
00:03:31,417 --> 00:03:33,875
Yes. Thank you.

25
00:03:33,875 --> 00:03:37,375
It was just a scratch. I'm relieved.

26
00:03:37,375 --> 00:03:40,083
I'm so relieved... Gugu.

27
00:03:41,042 --> 00:03:43,375
What in the world happened?

28
00:03:43,375 --> 00:03:47,042
I don't know. 
The mansion just started to collapse.

29
00:03:47,958 --> 00:03:49,042
Could it be...

30
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,292
Gugu!

31
00:03:56,417 --> 00:03:57,833
Fushi!

32
00:03:57,833 --> 00:04:00,792
Gugu... I'm sorry...

33
00:04:00,792 --> 00:04:03,917
Because of me... They came...

34
00:04:03,917 --> 00:04:05,500
I knew it.

35
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,708
Everyone got out...

36
00:04:07,708 --> 00:04:11,375
The two of them are the only ones left...

37
00:04:12,417 --> 00:04:14,125
Get a hold of yourself!

38
00:04:14,125 --> 00:04:17,500
But they've both been hurt.

39
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:21,000
If we don't act fast...

40
00:04:22,833 --> 00:04:24,667
Oh, no! It's collapsing!

41
00:04:34,375 --> 00:04:36,667
Mom! Dad!

42
00:04:43,792 --> 00:04:47,583
Wait, Gugu! Don't go!

43
00:04:49,083 --> 00:04:52,708
I... I love...

44
00:05:10,833 --> 00:05:12,375
Fushi!

45
00:05:14,167 --> 00:05:15,667
Where are you?

46
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:30,250
Fushi! You turned back.
It's just like back in the old days.

47
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:31,542
Thanks.

48
00:05:31,542 --> 00:05:34,667
Where's the enemy? I'll destroy them!

49
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:37,333
I can't see them. They must be hiding.

50
00:05:41,083 --> 00:05:43,333
There it is! Dodge!

51
00:05:46,917 --> 00:05:50,042
Looks like it can't stretch 
its limbs like before.

52
00:05:50,042 --> 00:05:51,542
That'll help us.

53
00:05:51,542 --> 00:05:53,042
Take this!

54
00:05:56,875 --> 00:05:58,333
Gugu...

55
00:05:59,333 --> 00:06:02,250
This... is not the same.

56
00:06:03,375 --> 00:06:06,417
Ah... Fire isn't working.

57
00:06:07,458 --> 00:06:09,750
Stone armor?

58
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:17,500
What the heck is going on?

59
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,083
Gugu, grab on!

60
00:06:23,208 --> 00:06:24,917
These creepy things again.

61
00:06:24,917 --> 00:06:27,542
Is that monster what's directing them?

62
00:06:30,833 --> 00:06:33,792
It's coming for us! It wants to crush us!

63
00:06:33,792 --> 00:06:35,708
Fushi! Go ahead!

64
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:44,417
What should we do, Gugu?

65
00:06:46,208 --> 00:06:49,958
I... I don't know how to defeat it...

66
00:06:54,208 --> 00:06:57,500
There's something inside it. Right?

67
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:02,333
Its skin is stone.

68
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:04,708
But it's not clean like a statue.

69
00:07:04,708 --> 00:07:06,792
Just aggregated stones.

70
00:07:06,792 --> 00:07:08,875
Inside it is proper meat.

71
00:07:08,875 --> 00:07:11,417
Climb onto it and look for a gap!

72
00:07:11,417 --> 00:07:12,500
Got it!

73
00:07:24,625 --> 00:07:27,917
This stone armor is quite deep!

74
00:07:27,917 --> 00:07:29,958
Fushi, give me a stick!

75
00:07:33,042 --> 00:07:35,292
I'll pry it open!

76
00:07:35,292 --> 00:07:37,292
Fushi, that's not enough! Give me more!

77
00:07:45,167 --> 00:07:47,292
I can see it! Its insides!

78
00:07:48,425 --> 00:07:50,883
It's soft. It looks like it'll burn well.

79
00:08:03,542 --> 00:08:05,083
We did it!

80
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:27,625
Destroy that!

81
00:08:42,292 --> 00:08:44,333
Fushi, are you all right?

82
00:08:46,333 --> 00:08:49,833
I had a chance, but I let it get away.

83
00:08:51,333 --> 00:08:54,000
It just means we're too strong for it.

84
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,667
We did it, Fushi!

85
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,875
Thanks, Gugu.

86
00:08:58,875 --> 00:09:02,333
If you weren't there, I would have lost again...

87
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:05,458
I may be immortal, but I'm weak.

88
00:09:06,625 --> 00:09:09,583
If you're ever in trouble, I'll help you.

89
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:11,917
That's what brothers are for!

90
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,208
Fu...

91
00:09:26,933 --> 00:09:29,642
Fu... Fushi!

92
00:09:29,667 --> 00:09:30,875
Fushi!

93
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,417
Thank goodness. I made it in time!

94
00:09:42,417 --> 00:09:45,667
Rynn? How long have you been here?

95
00:09:45,667 --> 00:09:47,667
You can't be here...

96
00:09:47,667 --> 00:09:50,500
I have a lot of things to ask you.

97
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:53,167
But first off, we need to escape.

98
00:09:55,208 --> 00:09:56,750
Hurry! This way!

99
00:09:58,208 --> 00:09:59,583
Fushi...

100
00:10:03,042 --> 00:10:04,667
It's crumbling!

101
00:10:04,667 --> 00:10:05,875
Run!

102
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,125
What's that cloud of smoke?

103
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:29,625
I'm worried...

104
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:53,708
Gugu...

105
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,542
This...

106
00:11:17,542 --> 00:11:19,500
This isn't my pain...

107
00:11:20,542 --> 00:11:22,792
-What is that?
-This isn't good!

108
00:11:23,625 --> 00:11:25,375
-Where's our child?
-Rynn!

109
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:27,750
Rynn!

110
00:11:36,875 --> 00:11:40,333
Are... Are you all right, Rynn?

111
00:11:52,625 --> 00:11:55,042
I need to hurry up and...

112
00:12:01,083 --> 00:12:04,125
It's quite loud outside.

113
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:07,750
It... It must be so heavy...

114
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:11,042
Not at all... It's all right...

115
00:12:11,042 --> 00:12:12,375
Don't worry.

116
00:12:12,375 --> 00:12:16,250
They'll come... and save us...

117
00:12:17,083 --> 00:12:21,208
Gugu, don't overexert yourself.

118
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:24,042
Flower...

119
00:12:33,667 --> 00:12:37,167
To... Tomorrow... I'll buy you another flower...

120
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,667
It'll be all right.

121
00:12:42,125 --> 00:12:44,833
No, Gugu.

122
00:12:44,833 --> 00:12:47,375
Let's go pick it ourselves.

123
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:57,417
I know of only one place
where this flower blooms.

124
00:12:57,417 --> 00:12:59,625
You know of it too, right, Gugu?

125
00:13:02,708 --> 00:13:09,042
Of course... We'll definitely go together...

126
00:13:26,125 --> 00:13:27,667
Rynn...

127
00:13:28,458 --> 00:13:30,292
I love you...

128
00:14:40,708 --> 00:14:43,333
No... It can't be!

129
00:14:44,167 --> 00:14:46,417
Gugu isn't dead!

130
00:14:46,417 --> 00:14:48,750
Gugu isn't dead!

131
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:54,500
He isn't dead!

132
00:15:49,917 --> 00:15:51,917
It escaped.

133
00:15:51,917 --> 00:15:54,292
It heads to the west.

134
00:15:54,292 --> 00:15:55,958
You must go after it.

135
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:58,833
Lift this rock!

136
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:02,708
Get more people!

137
00:16:02,708 --> 00:16:03,917
Yes!

138
00:16:07,375 --> 00:16:08,833
Is this all right?

139
00:16:09,542 --> 00:16:14,333
A part of you lies in that escaped core.

140
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:06,916
Oh, you're up.

141
00:17:06,916 --> 00:17:09,457
Brother? What are you doing?

142
00:17:09,458 --> 00:17:13,042
Can't you see? I'm carrying you.

143
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:17,374
Gugu! Welcome back!

144
00:17:17,375 --> 00:17:20,000
Looks like you've healed up.

145
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:26,125
All your wounds are gone! You look so nice!

146
00:17:28,333 --> 00:17:29,917
You're right!

147
00:17:29,917 --> 00:17:32,375
Wow, Gugu!

148
00:17:32,375 --> 00:17:33,792
Rynn!

149
00:17:34,417 --> 00:17:38,125
Come on! You made a promise!

150
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:41,125
Let's go pick flowers together!

151
00:17:48,167 --> 00:17:50,167
What happened to the enemy?

152
00:17:50,167 --> 00:17:53,083
Did we manage to defeat that huge thing?

153
00:17:53,083 --> 00:17:55,917
What about Fushi? Where is he?

154
00:18:27,417 --> 00:18:29,125
Ah... I see...

155
00:18:44,667 --> 00:18:48,042
Are you really going to leave, Fushi?

156
00:18:49,708 --> 00:18:52,833
You don't have to be in such a hurry...

157
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:55,708
The enemy will always come for me.

158
00:18:55,708 --> 00:18:59,125
I can't let anyone else die because of me.

159
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:05,042
Shin said he would deal with the aftermath.

160
00:19:05,042 --> 00:19:08,750
So I don't need to be here any longer.

161
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:10,458
Shin, it's time.

162
00:19:10,458 --> 00:19:11,583
Okay.

163
00:19:13,583 --> 00:19:17,000
You bought so many buns.
Where are you taking them?

164
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,667
To my little brother's place.

165
00:19:18,667 --> 00:19:21,917
Are all of those for your brother?

166
00:19:21,917 --> 00:19:24,458
Yes.

167
00:19:24,458 --> 00:19:27,000
He's a lot bigger than me.

168
00:19:30,833 --> 00:19:32,375
Gugu!

169
00:19:33,417 --> 00:19:34,708
Lady Rynn!

170
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:40,625
I... had a dream.

171
00:19:40,625 --> 00:19:45,083
It was the very epitome of happiness.

172
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:47,542
But something was missing.

173
00:19:47,542 --> 00:19:51,833
And now I see that. It was my true self.

174
00:19:54,875 --> 00:19:56,208
Fushi...

175
00:19:56,208 --> 00:19:59,833
I have no regrets.

176
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:10,583
What's wrong, Fushi?

177
00:20:13,083 --> 00:20:16,042
What should I do? Looking like this...

178
00:20:16,042 --> 00:20:18,875
What should I do?

179
00:20:20,833 --> 00:20:22,208
Gugu!

180
00:20:26,917 --> 00:20:30,125
You're all right! I'm so glad!

181
00:20:31,833 --> 00:20:34,333
Gugu... I love you!

182
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:45,958
Why am I who I am?

183
00:20:49,167 --> 00:20:51,458
Gugu, are you all right?

184
00:20:53,625 --> 00:20:55,375
I'm fine...

185
00:20:57,292 --> 00:21:00,958
Oh, right. What about Fushi? 
He's around, right?

186
00:21:02,625 --> 00:21:05,000
Fushi... died.

187
00:21:08,667 --> 00:21:12,000
No... It can't be...

188
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,792
Here... This is his grave.

189
00:21:28,125 --> 00:21:35,042
He was a brave... and wonderful person.

190
00:21:44,792 --> 00:21:48,833
Come, Gugu. Leave the rest to us.

191
00:21:48,833 --> 00:21:51,750
You need to be going soon, right?

192
00:21:52,667 --> 00:21:56,042
Ah... yes. That's right.

193
00:21:57,500 --> 00:22:00,250
What? Where are you going?

194
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:04,125
Um, well... Shopping.

195
00:22:04,125 --> 00:22:07,000
I... I'll go too. I'll help you.

196
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,333
Don't worry, Rynn. He'll be fine on his own.

197
00:22:09,333 --> 00:22:12,333
Another time, Rynn.

198
00:22:15,542 --> 00:22:18,750
Then... When you come back...

199
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:21,083
Let's go pick flowers together.

200
00:22:21,083 --> 00:22:23,042
At the place we promised to.

201
00:22:24,667 --> 00:22:28,042
I'll be waiting for you there.

202
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:35,750
Great! I'll be waiting!

203
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:42,292
Oh, that's right. 
I have something to return to you.

204
00:22:42,292 --> 00:22:45,875
Here. Your brother asked me to return it to you.

205
00:22:45,875 --> 00:22:47,833
Remember it?

206
00:22:50,125 --> 00:22:51,875
You should keep it.

207
00:22:51,875 --> 00:22:53,958
It'll remind you of Gu...

208
00:22:53,958 --> 00:22:57,042
Of me.

209
00:22:59,458 --> 00:23:02,292
I'm happy! Thanks!

210
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,250
Here, Gugu. Take these.

211
00:23:07,625 --> 00:23:11,292
It's not a lot, but here's some food and money.

212
00:23:12,833 --> 00:23:15,000
Be careful out there.

213
00:23:17,167 --> 00:23:18,833
Thank you...

214
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:40,833
Rynn!

215
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:44,833
Rynn! We've been looking all over for you!

216
00:23:44,833 --> 00:23:47,833
Goodness gracious. As soon as you wake up,

217
00:23:47,833 --> 00:23:50,542
you come here and stay here 
until the middle of the night.

218
00:23:50,542 --> 00:23:53,042
It's bad for your health!

219
00:23:53,042 --> 00:23:54,792
Come on. Let's go back.

220
00:23:55,625 --> 00:23:58,792
Father, I...

221
00:23:58,792 --> 00:24:01,292
I won't get married.

222
00:24:03,417 --> 00:24:05,708
I have someone I love.

223
00:24:08,167 --> 00:24:11,375
Who?

224
00:24:11,375 --> 00:24:13,875
I must see him.

225
00:24:14,708 --> 00:24:19,375
Well... He's no longer here.

226
00:24:23,583 --> 00:24:28,083
He's surely... "together" with him.

227
00:24:31,875 --> 00:24:34,792
In the face of great power,

228
00:24:34,792 --> 00:24:40,375
a life and memories were taken away.

229
00:24:40,375 --> 00:24:46,000
Someone accompanies by 
an annoyed Fushi's side.

230
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,750
Fushi embarks on a new journey
with determination.

231
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:50,917
And new encounters

232
00:24:50,917 --> 00:24:53,667
"EPISODE 13: WILL TOWARD A HIGHER STATE"
are coming soon.
