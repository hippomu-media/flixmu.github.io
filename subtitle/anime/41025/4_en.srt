1
00:00:01,375 --> 00:00:05,458
The sphere that I placed upon this land

2
00:00:05,458 --> 00:00:08,667
took the form of a young man.

3
00:00:08,667 --> 00:00:12,042
A girl from Ninannah, March,

4
00:00:12,042 --> 00:00:14,833
named "it", "Fushi".

5
00:00:15,958 --> 00:00:19,333
Through the battle with the Spirit Bear,

6
00:00:19,333 --> 00:00:22,792
it received stimulation

7
00:00:22,817 --> 00:00:25,483
and collected new information.

8
00:00:27,583 --> 00:00:30,750
Thank you.

9
00:01:58,583 --> 00:02:00,917
TO YOUR ETERNITY

10
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:06,083
Listen.

11
00:02:06,083 --> 00:02:08,917
Let's play a game
where you try not to be found by anyone.

12
00:02:08,917 --> 00:02:12,583
The game will continue
until I come back, so stay hidden until then.

13
00:02:12,583 --> 00:02:13,708
Got it?

14
00:02:13,708 --> 00:02:15,208
Sister...

15
00:02:15,208 --> 00:02:16,625
Here's some food.

16
00:02:16,625 --> 00:02:19,125
If you run out, pick some berries and fruits.

17
00:02:21,625 --> 00:02:22,875
Sister!

18
00:02:22,875 --> 00:02:27,292
If you win, I'll make a new doll for you!

19
00:02:27,875 --> 00:02:31,500
Parona, wherever have you been?

20
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:34,167
Where is my sister?

21
00:02:34,167 --> 00:02:37,083
She's not here anymore.

22
00:02:37,083 --> 00:02:40,250
She was chosen
as the sacrifice for the Spirit Bear.

23
00:02:42,875 --> 00:02:44,208
Sister...

24
00:02:44,208 --> 00:02:45,542
Running away?

25
00:02:45,542 --> 00:02:47,625
-Sister!
-Pathetic.

26
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:49,833
And you call yourself
a woman of the Ninannah?

27
00:02:49,833 --> 00:02:51,833
Sister!

28
00:02:51,833 --> 00:02:54,500
You are no longer one of us!

29
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,083
Scram! Leave this place!

30
00:03:07,917 --> 00:03:09,583
It was a dream...

31
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:14,458
What kind of face
did my sister have on back then?

32
00:03:14,458 --> 00:03:18,333
EPISODE FOUR
A LARGE VESSEL

33
00:03:25,917 --> 00:03:28,292
Thank you.

34
00:03:30,833 --> 00:03:33,250
Thank you.

35
00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:36,375
What a weird puppy!

36
00:03:37,542 --> 00:03:38,583
Here!

37
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:40,792
Thank you.

38
00:03:40,792 --> 00:03:43,333
How much longer will we be traveling?

39
00:03:43,333 --> 00:03:47,750
We should reach Yanome in roughly 20 days.

40
00:03:49,125 --> 00:03:52,250
You're the Shaman of Yanome, aren't you?

41
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:54,833
Why are you in the same dirty carriage as us?

42
00:03:55,958 --> 00:03:59,458
That's right! You did horrible things to March!

43
00:03:59,458 --> 00:04:02,042
Why did you choose me?

44
00:04:03,875 --> 00:04:07,458
You were the prettiest, that's why.

45
00:04:07,458 --> 00:04:09,875
I... I see.

46
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:11,292
Look.

47
00:04:11,292 --> 00:04:13,417
I am a criminal.

48
00:04:14,625 --> 00:04:18,125
To achieve their greedy ambitions,

49
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:21,500
they were desperate enough
to enlist the help of a fake shaman.

50
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:22,292
Desperate?

51
00:04:22,292 --> 00:04:25,792
They want the abundance
of the land of Ninannah.

52
00:04:25,792 --> 00:04:31,417
That is why they are so absorbed in Ninannah's
tradition and the sacrifice ritual.

53
00:04:32,167 --> 00:04:36,958
They clear their suspicion by dirtying their own hands in the ritual,
sending presents and thanks to give the ritual an air of heroism.

54
00:04:36,958 --> 00:04:41,208
"Oh, people of Ninannah, how well
you have devoted yourselves...

55
00:04:41,208 --> 00:04:44,250
to the betterment
of all people on this earth!"

56
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:45,958
The goal that lies beyond that dynamic

57
00:04:45,958 --> 00:04:50,583
is psychological conquering and domination.

58
00:04:50,583 --> 00:04:52,292
I wasn't aware...

59
00:04:53,083 --> 00:04:59,167
It's unpleasant that all of this arose
from one word of tradition.

60
00:04:59,167 --> 00:05:00,500
The fact that this ritual
already existed is even more abhorrent.

61
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,417
Oh, my!

62
00:05:02,417 --> 00:05:09,458
I had thought that the people of Ninannah
were folks who believe that faith is more important
than the lives of their brethren.

63
00:05:09,458 --> 00:05:12,083
They are antiquated adults.

64
00:05:12,083 --> 00:05:15,875
They are indifferent
to the souls of the suffering.

65
00:05:17,708 --> 00:05:21,708
This backward practice needs
to be put to an end as soon as possible.

66
00:05:21,708 --> 00:05:23,625
That is impossible.

67
00:05:23,625 --> 00:05:26,667
The older people of Ninannah
are fixated in their ways.

68
00:05:26,667 --> 00:05:30,875
They won't believe you
even if you tell them "God" is dead.

69
00:05:30,875 --> 00:05:32,250
"God"?

70
00:05:34,458 --> 00:05:36,250
What should I do?

71
00:05:39,708 --> 00:05:40,833
Ah! No! No!

72
00:05:40,833 --> 00:05:41,917
What happened?

73
00:05:42,542 --> 00:05:45,125
It's wet and stinky!

74
00:05:45,125 --> 00:05:46,833
It's flowing this way!

75
00:05:54,542 --> 00:05:57,417
Let's clean you up, puppy.

76
00:05:57,417 --> 00:06:00,167
It's cold but be brave!

77
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,458
Don't...

78
00:06:10,458 --> 00:06:13,042
everâ€¦

79
00:06:13,042 --> 00:06:14,792
forget about me.

80
00:06:20,208 --> 00:06:21,792
-What?
-Huh?

81
00:06:25,833 --> 00:06:27,833
It was you all along!

82
00:06:28,792 --> 00:06:30,583
I missed you!

83
00:06:30,583 --> 00:06:32,917
Do you know this guy?

84
00:06:32,917 --> 00:06:35,375
His name's Fushi.

85
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:39,792
The sun is setting. It's time to go.

86
00:06:42,208 --> 00:06:43,833
Fushi!

87
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:45,958
Come with March!

88
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:50,708
Good boy.

89
00:06:50,708 --> 00:06:53,833
I'll teach you how to use the bathroom later.

90
00:06:56,042 --> 00:06:59,042
It seems to be close with you, March.

91
00:06:59,042 --> 00:07:02,167
Fushi is still a child.

92
00:07:02,167 --> 00:07:06,000
That's why March decided
she will be Fushi's mom!

93
00:07:07,708 --> 00:07:10,375
He can't "die". So that's why his name is Fushi?

94
00:07:10,375 --> 00:07:13,125
A person who can't die is unfortunate.

95
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:17,917
I feel people's lives have a purpose to them.

96
00:07:17,917 --> 00:07:19,875
In living infinitely,

97
00:07:19,875 --> 00:07:22,833
what meaning will he find in living?

98
00:07:22,833 --> 00:07:24,375
Meaning?

99
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:26,458
Sorry, March.

100
00:07:26,458 --> 00:07:29,792
It's wrong to look
for meaning in life and death.

101
00:07:34,667 --> 00:07:36,542
I don't understand what you're saying,

102
00:07:36,542 --> 00:07:39,625
but March is very happy right now!

103
00:07:49,458 --> 00:07:51,667
Please wear this.

104
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,083
Yanome clothes.

105
00:07:55,083 --> 00:07:57,417
There are clothes for Fushi too!

106
00:07:57,417 --> 00:07:58,917
I'll put them on for you.

107
00:07:58,917 --> 00:08:01,333
Here we go!

108
00:08:01,333 --> 00:08:03,667
What will happen to us now?

109
00:08:03,667 --> 00:08:05,542
From today onwards,

110
00:08:07,042 --> 00:08:09,750
you are Parona and March of the Yanome.

111
00:08:16,583 --> 00:08:18,042
Look, big sister!

112
00:08:18,042 --> 00:08:20,208
There's a lot of tasty-looking stuff!

113
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:23,500
There are so many pretty things too!

114
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:26,333
Please help yourselves to what you like.

115
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:28,542
I'll pay.

116
00:08:28,542 --> 00:08:29,917
Really?

117
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:33,625
Mm... It smells good!

118
00:09:07,792 --> 00:09:11,292
Do you have something
you'd like to tell your loved ones?

119
00:09:12,542 --> 00:09:14,417
Let us help you! We are a letter shop!

120
00:09:14,417 --> 00:09:17,500
-Look, big sister!
-We can deliver your messages for you.

121
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:19,292
Welcome.

122
00:09:19,292 --> 00:09:22,833
Please write your message
on this piece of paper.

123
00:09:24,042 --> 00:09:25,333
Write?

124
00:09:25,333 --> 00:09:28,125
Oh, I see. Don't worry.

125
00:09:28,125 --> 00:09:31,417
I'll help you write it down.
Please tell me what you'd like to say.

126
00:09:31,417 --> 00:09:32,958
Then...

127
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:34,958
Mother, father, how are you?

128
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:38,125
March is in Yanome right now.

129
00:09:38,125 --> 00:09:40,542
Please don't worry about me!

130
00:09:40,542 --> 00:09:41,667
That's all.

131
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:44,500
Okay.

132
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,750
Where should I deliver this to?

133
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:48,333
To my parents!

134
00:09:48,333 --> 00:09:50,333
They are in Ninannah.

135
00:09:50,333 --> 00:09:51,625
Ninannah?

136
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:54,833
The Ninannah where the Spirit Bear lives?

137
00:09:54,833 --> 00:09:56,833
That's right!

138
00:09:56,833 --> 00:09:59,625
The Ninannah has no written script.

139
00:09:59,625 --> 00:10:01,833
Your parents

140
00:10:01,833 --> 00:10:05,875
will not be able to understand
what is written in the letter, March.

141
00:10:08,292 --> 00:10:11,458
But March knows a different script!

142
00:10:11,458 --> 00:10:13,833
Is that so? What kind?

143
00:10:18,917 --> 00:10:20,500
This!

144
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:23,458
And what does that mean?

145
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:28,208
It means "March is very well!"

146
00:10:28,875 --> 00:10:30,042
March.

147
00:10:30,042 --> 00:10:31,875
Please help me deliver this!

148
00:10:31,875 --> 00:10:33,292
All right.

149
00:10:33,292 --> 00:10:35,750
Where should I put it in Ninannah?

150
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:38,417
Where my parents live, of course!

151
00:10:38,417 --> 00:10:40,375
Which district? Which block?

152
00:10:40,375 --> 00:10:41,958
Whose jurisdiction?

153
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,458
Do you know, big sister?

154
00:10:45,458 --> 00:10:46,458
No.

155
00:10:46,458 --> 00:10:48,250
Ninannah is a large territory.

156
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:52,292
Even in the closest region,
there are over 40 villages.

157
00:10:52,292 --> 00:10:54,458
What is that picture?

158
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:57,625
March, let's go and have dinner.

159
00:11:02,292 --> 00:11:04,708
I'll hold onto this for you.

160
00:11:04,708 --> 00:11:07,750
We'll come back when we figure it out.

161
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,500
Okay.

162
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:18,000
What is this? It's so yummy!

163
00:11:20,833 --> 00:11:23,417
Look at the way she eats.

164
00:11:25,292 --> 00:11:28,875
Thank you...

165
00:11:28,875 --> 00:11:33,292
Fushi, you should eat properly.

166
00:11:33,292 --> 00:11:34,958
I've taught you before.

167
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:37,333
You have to eat with your hands.

168
00:11:40,375 --> 00:11:41,667
Got it?

169
00:11:41,667 --> 00:11:43,583
March, you should exercise manners as well.

170
00:11:43,583 --> 00:11:46,500
Why don't you try using
those chopsticks on your head?

171
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:47,708
Chopsticks?

172
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:50,375
These are "head scratchers"!

173
00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:53,167
They're used to scratch
your head when it itches!

174
00:11:54,125 --> 00:11:59,708
It seems that Yanome's culture
has not been properly propagated.

175
00:11:59,708 --> 00:12:03,125
I apologize.
Please continue as you have been eating.

176
00:12:07,208 --> 00:12:09,833
Fushi, eat as you please.

177
00:12:13,208 --> 00:12:15,250
Fushi, are you all right?

178
00:12:26,167 --> 00:12:29,917
I think he has learned Yanome's table manners.

179
00:12:29,917 --> 00:12:31,750
What do you think, March?

180
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:34,125
Yanome is a good place, isn't it?

181
00:12:34,125 --> 00:12:38,208
A place where you could
spend the rest of your life.

182
00:12:40,208 --> 00:12:42,125
Not really...

183
00:12:42,125 --> 00:12:44,000
March thinks...

184
00:12:45,458 --> 00:12:46,792
March?

185
00:12:50,583 --> 00:12:52,042
A pity.

186
00:13:00,167 --> 00:13:03,792
As expected, morning glory
from the west works wonders.

187
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:13,875
As I previously reported,

188
00:13:13,875 --> 00:13:17,417
during the iteration of this ritual
which has been conducted for many years,

189
00:13:17,417 --> 00:13:21,708
we caught sight of
and subsequently captured the Spirit Bear.

190
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:25,292
In addition,
I have something to show all of you.

191
00:13:25,292 --> 00:13:27,292
This boy.

192
00:13:28,042 --> 00:13:30,458
As we were returning from the ritual,

193
00:13:30,458 --> 00:13:35,458
we witnessed this boy take down the Spirit Bear.

194
00:13:35,458 --> 00:13:38,167
This boy felled the Spirit Bear?

195
00:13:38,167 --> 00:13:40,792
Yes. He is immortal.

196
00:13:43,667 --> 00:13:45,042
Move!

197
00:13:45,667 --> 00:13:49,042
If I kill you, they'll let me out!

198
00:13:58,375 --> 00:13:59,625
The wound... disappeared?

199
00:13:59,625 --> 00:14:01,167
How could it be?

200
00:14:10,375 --> 00:14:14,792
It hurts! Ow...

201
00:14:14,792 --> 00:14:21,333
Hurts... Ow...

202
00:14:23,875 --> 00:14:25,500
Don't blame me, little runt!

203
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:30,125
I just want to meet my love
and enjoy good food and live my life!

204
00:14:30,125 --> 00:14:33,417
-It hurts...
-Please die!

205
00:14:33,417 --> 00:14:36,458
It hurts...

206
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:40,333
Is he a "God" or is he a demon?

207
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:41,750
We have no idea as of right now.

208
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:44,208
We have yet to ascertain his capabilities.

209
00:14:44,208 --> 00:14:46,500
But I am convinced

210
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:50,208
that this boy is critical
to the future of the Yanome.

211
00:14:50,208 --> 00:14:51,708
Get out of the way, grandma!

212
00:14:53,625 --> 00:14:55,875
Cut his head off!

213
00:15:14,458 --> 00:15:15,708
It hurts...

214
00:15:15,708 --> 00:15:17,083
Fushi!

215
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:22,333
-March, please calm it down.
-It hurts...

216
00:15:24,083 --> 00:15:25,417
Hurts...

217
00:15:25,417 --> 00:15:26,917
Please bear with it.

218
00:15:26,917 --> 00:15:29,458
Hurts...

219
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:33,500
I won't forgive...

220
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,667
whoever did this to you!

221
00:15:36,375 --> 00:15:42,458
There we go...

222
00:15:43,625 --> 00:15:45,750
There, you're all better now!

223
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:48,125
You did great, Fushi!

224
00:15:48,125 --> 00:15:49,292
March!

225
00:15:49,292 --> 00:15:50,875
Are you with Fushi?

226
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:53,708
Big sister? Where are you?

227
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,833
I'm here, March!

228
00:16:01,833 --> 00:16:03,333
Big sister!

229
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:06,542
What do you have in that room?

230
00:16:06,542 --> 00:16:09,500
There's some straw and a bowl.

231
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,042
And this.

232
00:16:14,917 --> 00:16:17,625
Good. Tie it onto this.

233
00:16:17,625 --> 00:16:19,583
Where are we?

234
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:22,958
What's going to happen to us?

235
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:25,417
Don't worry, March.

236
00:16:25,417 --> 00:16:28,792
Could you get me some of Fushi's fur?

237
00:16:28,792 --> 00:16:30,458
Fushi's fur?

238
00:16:30,458 --> 00:16:32,625
Right. To the right.

239
00:16:35,167 --> 00:16:37,167
Uncle!

240
00:16:37,167 --> 00:16:39,875
When will March be able to leave this place?

241
00:16:39,875 --> 00:16:41,667
You'll be here forever.

242
00:16:46,125 --> 00:16:51,625
It hurts...

243
00:16:54,042 --> 00:16:57,833
What's wrong? Haven't your wounds healed?

244
00:16:57,833 --> 00:17:00,792
Hurts...

245
00:17:00,792 --> 00:17:02,333
Fushi?

246
00:17:10,583 --> 00:17:13,208
Hurts...

247
00:17:16,333 --> 00:17:21,083
Hurts...

248
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:24,625
What is this?

249
00:17:29,167 --> 00:17:30,458
Hurts...

250
00:17:31,792 --> 00:17:33,417
Hurts...

251
00:17:33,417 --> 00:17:34,625
An arrow...

252
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:37,333
So many of them...

253
00:17:37,333 --> 00:17:40,875
How pitiful... If we don't help it...

254
00:17:40,875 --> 00:17:42,583
How is it coming along?

255
00:17:42,583 --> 00:17:46,542
Well, nobody wants to tend to the Spirit Bear.

256
00:17:46,542 --> 00:17:49,833
What's so difficult about looking after a bear?

257
00:17:57,125 --> 00:17:59,208
Then, let her do it.

258
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:05,792
Is it all right? It's dangerous.

259
00:18:05,792 --> 00:18:07,333
It doesn't matter.

260
00:18:07,333 --> 00:18:09,583
There's no issue to be had

261
00:18:09,583 --> 00:18:11,458
with some girl dying.

262
00:18:15,583 --> 00:18:19,542
I can't believe they left the bear in your care.

263
00:18:19,542 --> 00:18:21,500
It's too dangerous for you
to do it all by yourself.

264
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:25,333
I'll be fine.
I have Fushi and Kanitarou with me.

265
00:18:25,333 --> 00:18:29,458
Big sister, you have your work too.

266
00:18:29,458 --> 00:18:30,750
You have to do your best too!

267
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:32,167
Right.

268
00:18:32,167 --> 00:18:33,458
But...

269
00:18:33,458 --> 00:18:35,083
Don't worry! It'll be all right!

270
00:18:37,292 --> 00:18:40,833
First, we'll have the old woman
fake illness to trick the Yanome.

271
00:18:41,833 --> 00:18:46,292
Help! I'm dying!

272
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:48,083
Then, I'll go save March.

273
00:18:48,083 --> 00:18:49,750
-Yay!
-Run!

274
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:51,250
Then, kill the Spirit Bear.

275
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:55,417
And bring back its eyes or fur as proof.

276
00:18:55,417 --> 00:18:59,417
The people of Ninannah
will know that there is no longer a need

277
00:18:59,417 --> 00:19:02,167
to continue with the ritual.

278
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:05,167
That should work.

279
00:19:05,167 --> 00:19:07,458
No... No matter what...

280
00:19:07,458 --> 00:19:08,750
I have to do it.

281
00:19:10,833 --> 00:19:13,917
Right, sister?

282
00:19:33,417 --> 00:19:36,792
Hey, big bear...
You're just like me, aren't you?

283
00:19:36,792 --> 00:19:39,125
When March left Ninannah,

284
00:19:39,125 --> 00:19:43,875
everyone told me how good of a girl I was.
Saying "thanks" and "congratulations"...

285
00:19:43,875 --> 00:19:46,708
But in the end, I'm just a normal girl.

286
00:19:46,708 --> 00:19:48,292
Hurts...

287
00:19:48,292 --> 00:19:53,500
You're just a bear who likes human meat.

288
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:57,042
People made a big fuss over you
and shot you with arrows...

289
00:19:57,042 --> 00:20:01,000
And they made you out
to be like the real scary Spirit Bear...

290
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,375
Once your wounds heal,
you'll be able to go back.

291
00:20:05,458 --> 00:20:07,083
Go back...

292
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:11,708
Ah, sorry for making you worry.

293
00:20:11,708 --> 00:20:13,292
Sorry...

294
00:20:13,292 --> 00:20:17,375
There, there...

295
00:20:18,708 --> 00:20:20,958
There we go...

296
00:20:21,958 --> 00:20:24,875
Hurts...

297
00:20:29,458 --> 00:20:33,042
Thank... you...

298
00:20:53,292 --> 00:20:56,125
And so the vessel opened.

299
00:21:07,958 --> 00:21:09,875
The Spirit Bear is dead.

300
00:21:09,875 --> 00:21:12,250
Its body will be disposed of tomorrow.

301
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:15,333
I must ensure that I have evidence
before we escape from here.

302
00:21:15,333 --> 00:21:18,292
March will be able to get out of here soon.

303
00:21:18,292 --> 00:21:21,083
She doesn't have to grow up here.

304
00:21:39,625 --> 00:21:40,750
Over there should do it...

305
00:21:42,667 --> 00:21:44,167
Sister!

306
00:21:44,792 --> 00:21:46,792
Hurts...

307
00:21:52,167 --> 00:21:56,167
This is... The tool room?

308
00:21:58,958 --> 00:22:01,167
I wondered what fell.

309
00:22:01,167 --> 00:22:02,750
So it was you.

310
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:06,667
I can help you keep this a secret.

311
00:22:06,667 --> 00:22:08,542
But you better be quiet...

312
00:22:15,875 --> 00:22:16,958
How dare you...

313
00:22:20,458 --> 00:22:23,750
Shut up and stay still.

314
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,500
Rotate out.

315
00:22:35,708 --> 00:22:37,792
What is going on...

316
00:22:37,792 --> 00:22:39,875
I'm taking you away.

317
00:22:45,125 --> 00:22:46,333
Sister.

318
00:22:46,333 --> 00:22:50,667
You must've been smiling back then, right?

319
00:22:50,667 --> 00:22:53,458
That is why I will use the life
that you've given me

320
00:22:53,458 --> 00:22:55,417
with purpose.

321
00:22:55,417 --> 00:22:57,000
Let's get out of here together!

322
00:22:58,125 --> 00:22:59,958
Big sister!

323
00:24:30,833 --> 00:24:34,417
Parona and the others

324
00:24:34,417 --> 00:24:37,292
are planning to escape from Yanome.

325
00:24:37,292 --> 00:24:41,542
However, the Yanome soldiers lead by Hayase

326
00:24:41,542 --> 00:24:44,292
are persistent.

327
00:24:45,125 --> 00:24:48,292
During the escape,

328
00:24:48,292 --> 00:24:50,208
Fushi's body...

329
00:24:50,208 --> 00:24:54,083
"EPISODE FIVE: THOSE WHO ACCOMPANY YOU"
faces another change.
