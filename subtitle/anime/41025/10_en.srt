1
00:00:02,375 --> 00:00:06,417
By the very process of one's living,

2
00:00:06,417 --> 00:00:10,708
it is inevitable that something will arise
to impede that continuity.

3
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:15,167
It will attack 
the fundamental constitution of that life

4
00:00:15,167 --> 00:00:18,333
and impede its freedom of choice.

5
00:00:19,875 --> 00:00:22,833
I don't think highly of this.

6
00:00:23,792 --> 00:00:25,667
Freedom of choice

7
00:00:25,667 --> 00:00:29,792
is a valuable right
that should be given to all.

8
00:01:59,542 --> 00:02:01,917
TO YOUR ETERNITY

9
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,917
EPISODE 10: NEW FAMILY

10
00:02:20,333 --> 00:02:21,542
Fushi!

11
00:02:24,958 --> 00:02:26,958
Gugu... Run...

12
00:02:37,417 --> 00:02:39,208
That guy...

13
00:02:39,208 --> 00:02:43,042
We were attacked by an unknown being
in the forest.

14
00:02:43,042 --> 00:02:46,458
It took the form of trees.

15
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:48,375
Run! Hurry...

16
00:02:48,375 --> 00:02:50,500
No, I'll help you!

17
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,375
Fushi!

18
00:03:22,167 --> 00:03:23,542
All right!

19
00:03:31,125 --> 00:03:32,375
Gugu!

20
00:03:49,125 --> 00:03:50,667
Alcohol...

21
00:03:53,708 --> 00:03:55,542
Fushi...

22
00:03:55,542 --> 00:03:58,625
What should I do?

23
00:04:00,833 --> 00:04:02,083
Hot!

24
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,500
Why is there fire here?

25
00:04:07,833 --> 00:04:09,208
I got it.

26
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:13,500
When I spit out that alcohol,
the area caught fire...

27
00:04:15,417 --> 00:04:17,042
I have an idea!

28
00:04:28,333 --> 00:04:30,833
While it's busy with Fushi...

29
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,042
Now!

30
00:04:35,167 --> 00:04:37,750
Take a big breath, clench your stomach,

31
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:39,333
and in one go...

32
00:04:42,458 --> 00:04:44,583
What? Why?

33
00:04:44,583 --> 00:04:46,958
There was so much of it earlier!

34
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:53,542
It can't be... Did I run out?

35
00:04:54,542 --> 00:04:55,583
Watch out!

36
00:04:59,208 --> 00:05:00,292
Fushi!

37
00:05:00,292 --> 00:05:03,000
If you don't run, I will be angry!

38
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,583
Leave here!

39
00:05:06,833 --> 00:05:07,958
Quick!

40
00:05:10,725 --> 00:05:12,892
Hang in there! I'll be back in five minutes!

41
00:05:12,917 --> 00:05:13,792
No!

42
00:05:13,792 --> 00:05:15,833
I'll bite you if you come back!

43
00:05:15,833 --> 00:05:17,375
Go ahead!

44
00:05:20,083 --> 00:05:22,583
One minute to get back to Grandpa Beer's house.

45
00:05:22,583 --> 00:05:26,042
Two minutes to pour the alcohol
into my stomach.

46
00:05:26,042 --> 00:05:27,833
Wait for me, Fushi!

47
00:05:35,042 --> 00:05:37,000
What...

48
00:05:40,625 --> 00:05:43,417
That's right... It's because of the alcohol...

49
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:45,292
Stand...

50
00:05:46,625 --> 00:05:47,917
I must go...

51
00:05:50,542 --> 00:05:54,333
I'm the only one who can save Fushi...

52
00:05:55,417 --> 00:05:56,583
Gugu!

53
00:06:00,583 --> 00:06:03,125
That's right... Go!

54
00:06:04,708 --> 00:06:05,875
Good...

55
00:06:06,583 --> 00:06:09,583
Almost... there...

56
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:22,417
You're the guy who was with Miss Rynn!

57
00:06:22,417 --> 00:06:24,292
What?

58
00:06:24,292 --> 00:06:28,458
Were you the one who misled my daughter?

59
00:06:28,458 --> 00:06:30,542
Hey! Weren't you listening? I told you!

60
00:06:30,542 --> 00:06:32,833
I ran away from home on my own!

61
00:06:32,833 --> 00:06:35,250
They're not related to this!

62
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:37,583
Just what did you do to our daughter?

63
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Sorry, I didn't think they would come this far.

64
00:06:45,583 --> 00:06:47,542
That's enough for now, dear.

65
00:06:47,542 --> 00:06:49,292
It's late.

66
00:06:51,375 --> 00:06:53,833
Gugu, what's wrong?

67
00:06:53,833 --> 00:06:55,417
You look a bit sick.

68
00:06:58,083 --> 00:07:00,000
Grandpa, give me alcohol!

69
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,833
The strongest alcohol you have!

70
00:07:13,292 --> 00:07:17,542
What do you mean, Gugu?
What do you need alcohol for?

71
00:07:17,542 --> 00:07:23,500
The alcohol in my stomach ran out!
So I need more!

72
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:26,417
Not just any alcohol.

73
00:07:26,417 --> 00:07:29,542
The strongest you've got!

74
00:07:29,542 --> 00:07:32,000
Goodness. What's with this child?

75
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,583
-Come on, give it to me...
-Hey, what's going on?

76
00:07:34,583 --> 00:07:37,083
-Hurry up...
-What happened? Where's Fushi?

77
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:43,292
Fushi's in the forest... Boom! Fwoosh!

78
00:07:43,292 --> 00:07:46,792
So I need to hurry up and go back.

79
00:07:46,792 --> 00:07:49,875
Old man, I'll take care of this.

80
00:07:49,875 --> 00:07:52,917
Do as Gugu says.

81
00:07:53,708 --> 00:07:55,042
Got it.

82
00:07:58,333 --> 00:08:04,458
I've refined this alcohol to no end.
It's the best we have.

83
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:15,833
It seems... There may be internal damage.

84
00:08:15,858 --> 00:08:17,900
You could die if you continue.

85
00:08:18,833 --> 00:08:21,167
There's no time!

86
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:23,125
Put it in!

87
00:08:23,125 --> 00:08:24,292
Hurry...

88
00:08:24,292 --> 00:08:25,958
Rynn, let's go back.

89
00:08:27,392 --> 00:08:30,183
No! I want to stay here!

90
00:08:30,208 --> 00:08:31,917
Stop acting up!

91
00:08:31,917 --> 00:08:34,417
You're causing trouble for the people here.

92
00:08:35,125 --> 00:08:37,832
If she doesn't get what she wants,
my daughter acts this way.

93
00:08:37,832 --> 00:08:42,166
That's why she ran away.

94
00:08:42,167 --> 00:08:44,750
But there's no real problem.

95
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:50,458
Isn't the problem that you think
there's no problem?

96
00:08:53,375 --> 00:08:55,208
Come, let's go back.

97
00:08:56,958 --> 00:08:59,500
No! I don't want to!

98
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:02,750
-Stop acting so selfishly.
-No! Let go of me!

99
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,750
She can't go back...

100
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:08,750
This has nothing to do with you. Step away.

101
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:13,042
It doesn't matter. She can't!

102
00:09:13,042 --> 00:09:15,208
I'm telling you, she can't!

103
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:19,708
Why are you so insistent?

104
00:09:19,708 --> 00:09:23,042
We raised you so that
you wouldn't make such a fool of yourself!

105
00:09:23,042 --> 00:09:24,667
We've done so much for you!

106
00:09:24,667 --> 00:09:26,875
That's why!

107
00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:30,750
I want to live freely!

108
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:33,083
Even if it means making a fool of myself!

109
00:09:36,042 --> 00:09:38,625
I get it now.

110
00:09:38,625 --> 00:09:42,375
You didn't like
that we decided your fiance for you, right?

111
00:09:43,841 --> 00:09:45,216
That's not it...

112
00:09:47,058 --> 00:09:52,142
Really? Rynn already has a fiance?

113
00:09:52,167 --> 00:09:53,875
That's...

114
00:09:56,375 --> 00:09:59,500
I don't know who that guy is.

115
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:02,000
But the one who loves Rynn the most

116
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,542
is me, Gugu!

117
00:10:08,542 --> 00:10:10,542
I'm off. See you.

118
00:10:10,542 --> 00:10:11,958
I'll leave the rest to you guys!

119
00:10:18,875 --> 00:10:20,875
Let's go, Rynn.

120
00:10:45,083 --> 00:10:47,875
Fushi! I'm back!

121
00:10:47,875 --> 00:10:49,083
Where's the enemy?

122
00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:52,958
Fushi?

123
00:11:02,667 --> 00:11:04,792
You're all right, Fushi!

124
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:08,708
No... That's not Fushi.

125
00:11:13,625 --> 00:11:16,125
Fushi, where are you?

126
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:17,458
Fushi!

127
00:11:24,667 --> 00:11:27,750
What did you do to Fushi, you bastard?

128
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,792
Give Fushi back to me!

129
00:11:49,917 --> 00:11:52,792
What is the meaning of this? Please step aside.

130
00:12:24,583 --> 00:12:26,208
I've got plenty more!

131
00:12:37,667 --> 00:12:39,125
It's burning!

132
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:40,792
The forest is on fire!

133
00:12:41,708 --> 00:12:43,333
Gugu...

134
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:58,708
Fushi... Where did you go?

135
00:13:01,375 --> 00:13:03,667
You're immortal, aren't you?

136
00:13:03,667 --> 00:13:05,875
But did you get swallowed up?

137
00:13:08,375 --> 00:13:12,500
Because you were there, I had fun...

138
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,667
I was happy...

139
00:13:14,667 --> 00:13:18,958
I thought I might be satisfied being myself...

140
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:23,583
I'm sorry, Fushi...

141
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:25,542
For being such a powerless brother...

142
00:13:40,167 --> 00:13:42,167
What's that light?

143
00:14:21,875 --> 00:14:23,625
A rock...

144
00:14:24,417 --> 00:14:30,500
Well, well. Fushi, you're quite the lucky one.

145
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:34,083
This fragile, but by no means weak, existence...

146
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:37,542
Shall surely make you stronger...

147
00:14:39,167 --> 00:14:40,625
In good time...

148
00:14:55,542 --> 00:14:56,792
Fushi!

149
00:14:58,208 --> 00:15:01,417
I defeated the enemy. I did.

150
00:15:02,708 --> 00:15:04,208
Really?

151
00:15:12,458 --> 00:15:14,917
That hurts, you fool!

152
00:15:21,958 --> 00:15:24,750
Thank you, Gugu.

153
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:37,167
They're back!

154
00:15:37,167 --> 00:15:39,833
What happened out there?

155
00:15:40,917 --> 00:15:42,833
Nothing!

156
00:15:45,333 --> 00:15:47,417
As expected of Gugu!

157
00:15:48,167 --> 00:15:50,625
I'm going to eat it all up!

158
00:15:51,417 --> 00:15:55,833
Delicious! Gugu's cooking is the best!

159
00:15:55,833 --> 00:15:58,292
Thanks for coming back, Gugu!

160
00:15:58,292 --> 00:16:01,208
Have you come around to forgive me yet?

161
00:16:01,208 --> 00:16:02,875
No, I won't forgive you.

162
00:16:04,683 --> 00:16:07,017
So from now on, I won't call you Grandpa Beer.

163
00:16:07,042 --> 00:16:09,833
I'll call you Old Beer Geezer.

164
00:16:11,792 --> 00:16:14,958
But... In the end, you did save my life.

165
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:18,333
So I'll take off the "old"
and leave it at Beer Geezer.

166
00:16:18,333 --> 00:16:21,125
Gugu...

167
00:16:21,125 --> 00:16:25,625
Hey! Address your elders more respectfully.

168
00:16:25,625 --> 00:16:27,917
Sorry.

169
00:16:27,917 --> 00:16:31,500
You know, this kid is quite skilled.

170
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,750
Much more so than ours...

171
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,833
How surprising!

172
00:16:38,833 --> 00:16:40,417
Hey, Gugu.

173
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:43,458
Where's Fushi?

174
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:45,958
I asked him to get some water.

175
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:47,417
He should be back soon.

176
00:16:54,708 --> 00:16:58,375
Fushi. You must leave this place.

177
00:17:00,458 --> 00:17:02,875
Why?

178
00:17:02,875 --> 00:17:07,583
There is a method
by which you can become stronger.

179
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:11,666
It is never to stay sedentary.

180
00:17:11,666 --> 00:17:14,249
I... don't understand.

181
00:17:15,583 --> 00:17:21,458
"Knockers" thus have I named them.

182
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:26,166
The pound on the doors of paradise,
seeking its destruction.

183
00:17:26,166 --> 00:17:28,499
They will study and grow.

184
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:34,083
If they have lost this time,
they will seek to succeed the next.

185
00:17:34,083 --> 00:17:38,042
You, as you are now,
shall certainly lose when they next attack.

186
00:17:38,042 --> 00:17:41,417
As happened last time,
you will be turned back into a rock

187
00:17:41,417 --> 00:17:44,667
or a pile of moss,

188
00:17:44,667 --> 00:17:46,625
Surely you understand.

189
00:17:46,625 --> 00:17:49,625
Gugu will defeat the enemy.

190
00:17:49,625 --> 00:17:51,583
Gugu is strong.

191
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:58,583
I need Gugu. I can't leave.

192
00:18:01,208 --> 00:18:04,125
That is fine as well.

193
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:06,500
If you shall see this to the end,

194
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:07,833
I have no objection.

195
00:18:07,833 --> 00:18:09,208
Fushi?

196
00:18:14,042 --> 00:18:17,292
What's with the monologue?

197
00:18:17,292 --> 00:18:19,292
It's not like you.

198
00:18:20,792 --> 00:18:22,958
You can't see?

199
00:18:22,958 --> 00:18:24,583
See what?

200
00:18:25,417 --> 00:18:27,917
It doesn't matter. Come quick!

201
00:18:27,917 --> 00:18:30,125
Everyone else has already started eating.

202
00:18:47,792 --> 00:18:50,292
You're going back?

203
00:18:50,292 --> 00:18:52,250
Yes. I've been in your care for a long time.

204
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:54,500
But... Will you be all right?

205
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:58,083
With your parents and all...

206
00:18:58,083 --> 00:19:03,667
Well, they're obviously 
not going to leave without me.

207
00:19:03,667 --> 00:19:05,917
And...

208
00:19:05,917 --> 00:19:10,250
I don't care about my own circumstances anymore.

209
00:19:12,292 --> 00:19:16,708
It looks like we have one point in common.

210
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:20,083
The man who saved me is by no means

211
00:19:20,083 --> 00:19:22,542
a good person.

212
00:19:22,542 --> 00:19:23,792
But

213
00:19:23,792 --> 00:19:26,583
I'm not weak enough
to be able to put up with that.

214
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:38,583
See you later!

215
00:19:38,583 --> 00:19:40,208
Grandpa! Grandma!

216
00:19:40,208 --> 00:19:42,625
Fushi! Shopkeeper!

217
00:19:43,583 --> 00:19:45,333
Shopkeeper...

218
00:19:46,333 --> 00:19:49,000
I'm kidding, Gugu.

219
00:19:56,958 --> 00:19:59,292
All right. 
It's time to get ready to open the store.

220
00:19:59,292 --> 00:20:01,792
I'm done for today. I'm going to sleep.

221
00:20:01,792 --> 00:20:03,917
Oh, Gugu.

222
00:20:03,917 --> 00:20:05,292
What?

223
00:20:05,292 --> 00:20:08,333
Teach me to cook.

224
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:09,875
Cook? What happened?

225
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,917
Have you started admiring me?

226
00:20:19,542 --> 00:20:20,958
Welcome!

227
00:20:20,958 --> 00:20:23,042
The same as always.

228
00:20:23,042 --> 00:20:25,625
Could I sample that?

229
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:26,875
Of course.

230
00:20:28,417 --> 00:20:31,042
The liquor here has gotten quite good.

231
00:20:31,042 --> 00:20:32,542
Thank you for the compliment.

232
00:20:33,375 --> 00:20:36,500
And you've been here a long while as well.

233
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,458
How long has it been?

234
00:20:39,917 --> 00:20:41,708
Four years now?

235
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:42,583
Yes.

236
00:20:42,583 --> 00:20:45,625
Gugu, lend me a hand.

237
00:20:45,625 --> 00:20:48,625
Why would you put it up there?

238
00:20:48,625 --> 00:20:51,125
Why would you put so much in it?

239
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:54,333
You've become quite strong.

240
00:20:54,333 --> 00:20:58,083
You used to be so small.

241
00:20:58,083 --> 00:21:00,333
"Why am I who I am?"

242
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:04,542
What... was I thinking back then?

243
00:21:07,208 --> 00:21:09,042
Back then...

244
00:21:09,042 --> 00:21:11,292
I used to hate myself.

245
00:21:11,833 --> 00:21:14,458
How about now, Gugu,

246
00:21:14,458 --> 00:21:16,542
four years later?

247
00:21:22,292 --> 00:21:24,292
Excuse me.

248
00:21:25,125 --> 00:21:28,042
Hey, Rynn. Ran away from home again?

249
00:21:28,042 --> 00:21:30,375
Yes. The second time this month.

250
00:21:30,375 --> 00:21:32,458
What's the excuse?

251
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:35,542
Fushi said he was interested in sewing,

252
00:21:35,542 --> 00:21:38,292
so I brought a bunch of stuff from home.

253
00:21:38,292 --> 00:21:40,792
Fushi's making lunch.

254
00:21:40,792 --> 00:21:42,417
Second floor, then?

255
00:21:43,542 --> 00:21:45,917
The food looks delicious!

256
00:21:45,917 --> 00:21:48,750
Fushi's cooking has improved so much!

257
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:50,708
You can join us for lunch too if you'd like.

258
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:55,000
Hm? Fushi isn't here?

259
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,875
Fushi went to wash up.

260
00:21:57,875 --> 00:22:01,500
Hey, Grandma! You started eating alone again!

261
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:04,667
I've told you to wait for everyone first!

262
00:22:04,667 --> 00:22:05,708
Shut up!

263
00:22:05,708 --> 00:22:08,875
If I wait, the food will get cold!

264
00:22:25,583 --> 00:22:27,167
Fushi, make it quick.

265
00:22:27,167 --> 00:22:29,042
We're going to eat.

266
00:22:30,417 --> 00:22:31,750
I'm coming.

267
00:22:32,292 --> 00:22:34,708
What were you looking at?

268
00:22:34,708 --> 00:22:36,917
You can go ahead and pop the pimples.

269
00:22:36,917 --> 00:22:40,542
Not that... 
There's some hair growing on my chin...

270
00:22:40,542 --> 00:22:41,958
A beard?

271
00:22:41,958 --> 00:22:43,750
Just like an adult.

272
00:22:44,542 --> 00:22:46,708
Congratulations, Fushi.

273
00:24:30,833 --> 00:24:36,333
Four years have passed 
since the battle with "Knockers".

274
00:24:36,333 --> 00:24:41,250
However, peaceful days do not last long.

275
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:46,583
Gugu's estranged brother, Shin,
makes another visit.

276
00:24:46,583 --> 00:24:51,208
The gears of fate between Gugu and Rynn...

277
00:24:51,208 --> 00:24:54,833
"EPISODE 11: GIFT FROM THE PAST"
gradually begins to turn.
