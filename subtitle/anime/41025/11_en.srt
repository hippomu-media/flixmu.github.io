1
00:01:28,333 --> 00:01:30,875
TO YOUR ETERNITY

2
00:01:31,917 --> 00:01:35,208
And then, after that, you put this 
over here like this and tighten it.

3
00:01:35,208 --> 00:01:37,167
Tighten it...

4
00:01:37,167 --> 00:01:38,417
Hey, Fushi.

5
00:01:38,417 --> 00:01:42,958
Next month is the party 
for my sixteenth birthday.

6
00:01:42,958 --> 00:01:45,000
Will you and Gugu come?

7
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,042
Sure. I'll tell Gugu.

8
00:01:48,042 --> 00:01:49,500
That's great!

9
00:01:50,167 --> 00:01:55,500
For these four years,
Fushi has not transformed once.

10
00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:00,667
Without the switching of forms
accompanying transformations,

11
00:02:00,667 --> 00:02:07,250
Fushi's body could properly experience
the passage of time, and thus he grew.

12
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:11,375
There were two reasons Fushi did not transform.

13
00:02:11,375 --> 00:02:12,500
First,

14
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:17,792
the Knockers luckily
never attacked during this period.

15
00:02:18,917 --> 00:02:20,250
Second,

16
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:24,417
Fushi decided to abstain from doing so.

17
00:02:24,417 --> 00:02:30,000
It seems he wanted to live just as
Gugu and the others, who could not transform.

18
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,208
And for the same reasons,

19
00:02:31,208 --> 00:02:34,750
he never summoned objects.

20
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:41,833
This human life to me
seems to have been small-scale and uneventful.

21
00:02:41,833 --> 00:02:45,458
And thus he acquired little.

22
00:02:45,458 --> 00:02:48,250
For example, lobsters,

23
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:49,625
prawns,

24
00:02:49,625 --> 00:02:52,000
wet clothes and buckets...

25
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
The dog, Myrr.

26
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,125
Pots.

27
00:02:55,125 --> 00:02:56,792
Heavy rocks.

28
00:02:56,792 --> 00:02:58,542
Fragments of pottery.

29
00:02:58,542 --> 00:03:00,208
Rotten sweet potatoes.

30
00:03:00,208 --> 00:03:02,292
And a sewing needle.

31
00:03:03,042 --> 00:03:04,958
Oh, no! Did you hurt yourself?

32
00:03:04,958 --> 00:03:06,958
I'll get some disinfectant from Grandpa!

33
00:03:06,958 --> 00:03:10,875
It's all right. It's just a scratch.

34
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:12,917
Really?

35
00:03:12,917 --> 00:03:17,083
So... What were you talking about before?

36
00:03:17,083 --> 00:03:20,750
What do you think Gugu likes the most?

37
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:23,542
He likes lobsters.

38
00:03:23,542 --> 00:03:24,958
Lobsters?

39
00:03:24,958 --> 00:03:28,458
Got it. I'll have some prepared for the party.

40
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:32,042
Oh! I sewed some tops for him. 
Do you think he would wear them?

41
00:03:32,042 --> 00:03:34,583
I've never seen him wearing a top.

42
00:03:35,417 --> 00:03:39,875
Is there anything I could make
that he would like?

43
00:03:39,875 --> 00:03:43,208
I remember him saying he needed
a towel to wipe his feet.

44
00:03:43,208 --> 00:03:46,333
A towel? No thanks.

45
00:03:46,333 --> 00:03:47,333
Why not?

46
00:03:47,333 --> 00:03:51,042
I think he would be happy
with anything you give him.

47
00:03:52,625 --> 00:03:54,208
Really?

48
00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:58,250
EPISODE 11: GIFT FROM THE PAST

49
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:06,000
You know, when I turn 16, I'll have to get 
married to some guy decided by my parents.

50
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,208
Do you know what marriage is?

51
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:11,292
If I get married,

52
00:04:11,292 --> 00:04:14,417
it would be like becoming my mother!

53
00:04:14,417 --> 00:04:16,375
I would have to live 
with someone I don't care for

54
00:04:16,375 --> 00:04:18,583
and have annoying children.

55
00:04:18,583 --> 00:04:19,791
Is that bad?

56
00:04:19,791 --> 00:04:21,374
Of course!

57
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:25,375
I haven't even seen the guy's face.

58
00:04:25,375 --> 00:04:29,125
Does he wear a mask like Gugu?

59
00:04:29,125 --> 00:04:31,792
That's not what I mean.

60
00:04:31,792 --> 00:04:35,208
First of all, you shouldn't get married
to someone you don't love!

61
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:40,500
That's why during the party,
I'll introduce my lover to my parents!

62
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:44,750
And to do that, I have to first get a lover.

63
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:48,042
So with someone I like...

64
00:04:48,042 --> 00:04:50,042
I have to...

65
00:04:52,958 --> 00:04:55,000
I have to try my best...

66
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:59,167
This feeling is...

67
00:04:59,167 --> 00:05:02,417
It's like the one Gugu gets
when he talks to you.

68
00:05:02,417 --> 00:05:03,792
Is that what it means

69
00:05:03,792 --> 00:05:07,833
-to have someone you like?
-What about Gugu? What are you talking about?

70
00:05:07,833 --> 00:05:09,917
Is the one you like Gugu...

71
00:05:09,917 --> 00:05:11,792
It's done!

72
00:05:11,792 --> 00:05:14,375
A lobster-shaped mask!

73
00:05:14,375 --> 00:05:15,500
How is it?

74
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:18,125
I think it looks nice. 
Are you planning to give it to Gugu?

75
00:05:18,125 --> 00:05:20,625
What did you make, Gugu?

76
00:05:20,625 --> 00:05:23,292
A sweat towel for Grandpa.

77
00:05:23,292 --> 00:05:25,375
Wow, you're skilled!

78
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:26,792
You did great!

79
00:05:26,792 --> 00:05:29,000
I'm sure the old man will be happy.

80
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:35,458
Gugu.

81
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,417
You're Gugu, right?

82
00:05:43,417 --> 00:05:45,542
It's me. Your brother.

83
00:05:47,125 --> 00:05:48,625
Are you not going to ask?

84
00:05:49,625 --> 00:05:51,250
Ask Gugu.

85
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:52,750
Ask him what?

86
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:54,708
To marry you.

87
00:05:54,708 --> 00:05:56,083
Gu...

88
00:05:56,083 --> 00:05:59,125
Was it Gugu we were talking about?

89
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:01,083
That's what I had thought.

90
00:06:02,917 --> 00:06:05,083
You know it too, right, Rynn?

91
00:06:05,083 --> 00:06:07,500
Gugu likes you.

92
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:11,958
So if you ask him to marry you, 
he'll be very happy.

93
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:16,042
I'm exhausted.

94
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:17,708
Welcome back, Grandpa.

95
00:06:17,708 --> 00:06:19,750
Here, a present.

96
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,167
What is this?

97
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:26,292
Oh, a sweat towel! Thank you!

98
00:06:26,292 --> 00:06:28,792
I'll give my present to him too then.

99
00:06:31,208 --> 00:06:33,792
Gugu's busy right now.

100
00:06:36,792 --> 00:06:40,625
It's been a while, huh? Have you been well?

101
00:06:40,625 --> 00:06:42,792
You've changed a lot.

102
00:06:42,792 --> 00:06:44,708
What's with the mask?

103
00:06:44,708 --> 00:06:46,875
Is it to hide your face?

104
00:06:46,875 --> 00:06:49,958
You've been living here?

105
00:06:49,958 --> 00:06:52,792
How is it?

106
00:06:52,792 --> 00:06:54,500
Are you enjoying it?

107
00:06:55,375 --> 00:06:57,750
I mean...

108
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:01,250
If you're happy, I'm happy too...

109
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:04,250
It was probably for the best that we split up...

110
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:06,167
Why did you come here?

111
00:07:06,167 --> 00:07:08,750
Did you come to have me acknowledge
how useless you are?

112
00:07:12,708 --> 00:07:14,792
What's going on, old man?

113
00:07:14,792 --> 00:07:17,750
Gugu's brother is here.

114
00:07:19,333 --> 00:07:22,375
I'm sorry, Gugu.

115
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:24,708
Back then, I wasn't right in the head...

116
00:07:24,708 --> 00:07:27,750
Right in the head? No, brother.

117
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,667
That was your true nature.

118
00:07:29,667 --> 00:07:32,500
You betrayed me and abandoned me!

119
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:35,500
That's... That's right...

120
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,083
But...

121
00:07:37,083 --> 00:07:40,000
Even for me then...

122
00:07:44,375 --> 00:07:46,667
You lent me a hand.

123
00:07:51,833 --> 00:07:56,583
I'm sorry it took me four years to find you.

124
00:07:57,708 --> 00:08:01,542
I'm running a farming business now.

125
00:08:01,542 --> 00:08:05,958
I employ people and live on a steady income.

126
00:08:05,958 --> 00:08:08,208
I eat three meals every day...

127
00:08:08,208 --> 00:08:10,750
And while I haven't

128
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:12,375
built that mansion yet...

129
00:08:13,167 --> 00:08:17,417
I still want to make 
that dream come true with you.

130
00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:21,958
I want to make it up to you

131
00:08:21,958 --> 00:08:24,042
and start over.

132
00:08:25,792 --> 00:08:27,542
That life...

133
00:08:27,542 --> 00:08:32,750
as siblings we shared. Won't you come with me?

134
00:08:40,082 --> 00:08:41,749
No.

135
00:08:43,042 --> 00:08:46,583
It's true I was incredibly unlucky
to have been abandoned by you.

136
00:08:46,583 --> 00:08:50,250
But what I've gained by overcoming that...

137
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:52,833
is worth a miracle.

138
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:56,333
Grandpa Beer is crazy,
but he's a genius who saved my life.

139
00:08:56,333 --> 00:08:59,000
Grandma is funny and knows a lot.

140
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,500
Rynn comes to play with us 
now and then. She's so nice.

141
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:07,708
And then there's 
my irreplaceable little brother, Fushi.

142
00:09:07,708 --> 00:09:10,042
These relations are the property I own.

143
00:09:10,042 --> 00:09:11,333
Don't try

144
00:09:11,333 --> 00:09:14,083
to take even these away from me!

145
00:09:17,208 --> 00:09:20,250
Ah... Of course.

146
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:23,250
Well, I have work to do.

147
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:25,125
If you are ever in trouble,

148
00:09:25,125 --> 00:09:27,375
you can count on me for help!

149
00:09:36,792 --> 00:09:42,208
That's the last thing I can offer...

150
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:44,833
to prove that I'm your older brother.

151
00:09:49,792 --> 00:09:51,417
Welcome!

152
00:09:52,083 --> 00:09:54,583
Have you finished speaking already?

153
00:09:56,667 --> 00:09:59,250
Sorry for visiting all of a sudden.

154
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:02,250
I was given this by Gugu.

155
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:03,667
Could you...

156
00:10:03,667 --> 00:10:05,917
return this to him?

157
00:10:07,417 --> 00:10:08,917
Sure.

158
00:10:09,667 --> 00:10:11,333
Thank you.

159
00:10:12,042 --> 00:10:13,625
Farewell.

160
00:10:15,583 --> 00:10:18,208
What is it? What did you get?

161
00:10:19,708 --> 00:10:21,042
This is...

162
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:25,458
How do you like it? It matches you so well!

163
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:28,458
I had it crafted by an artisan.

164
00:10:28,458 --> 00:10:30,833
I don't like this color.

165
00:10:32,792 --> 00:10:34,708
What's the matter, Rynn?

166
00:10:38,167 --> 00:10:42,042
Welcome!

167
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:46,042
He's there every day, isn't he?

168
00:10:46,042 --> 00:10:49,250
Yes. He's probably working.

169
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:52,042
That's so strange. Making children work.

170
00:10:52,042 --> 00:10:53,500
I feel bad for him.

171
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:56,583
Not at all. It's something to be proud of.

172
00:10:56,583 --> 00:11:00,000
Oh, no! Myrr ran away again.

173
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,042
I have to find Myrr...

174
00:11:02,042 --> 00:11:04,875
Myrr!

175
00:11:11,958 --> 00:11:14,042
I have to give you a reward.

176
00:11:19,542 --> 00:11:21,208
I see...

177
00:11:21,208 --> 00:11:23,250
It was you all along.

178
00:11:24,667 --> 00:11:26,417
Is everything all right?

179
00:11:27,542 --> 00:11:29,875
Yes.

180
00:11:29,875 --> 00:11:32,333
Can I give this to Gugu?

181
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:34,292
Please do.

182
00:11:35,083 --> 00:11:38,042
Gugu!

183
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,125
Oh, he fell asleep.

184
00:12:08,833 --> 00:12:10,625
Ow!

185
00:12:11,417 --> 00:12:14,125
Rynn, what did you do to me?

186
00:12:15,417 --> 00:12:18,875
Gugu, if you're going to seduce me, 
now is the time!

187
00:12:19,833 --> 00:12:23,208
Huh? Why... What?

188
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:28,392
Because I'm going to be married off soon!

189
00:12:28,417 --> 00:12:30,583
What? Really?

190
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:34,542
Are you all right with me 
getting married to some weird stranger?

191
00:12:34,542 --> 00:12:37,583
Why are you asking me that?

192
00:12:37,583 --> 00:12:40,542
Don't you love me?

193
00:12:40,542 --> 00:12:42,000
What? What's this about?

194
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,583
But you said it

195
00:12:43,583 --> 00:12:45,625
when we came back that day!

196
00:12:45,625 --> 00:12:49,292
"The one who loves Rynn the most is me, Gugu!"

197
00:12:49,292 --> 00:12:52,417
Did I say something that embarrassing?

198
00:12:52,417 --> 00:12:54,458
I... I don't remember...

199
00:12:56,667 --> 00:12:58,458
Ow!

200
00:12:58,458 --> 00:13:01,375
Next month is my birthday party!

201
00:13:01,375 --> 00:13:03,167
You better come!

202
00:13:06,083 --> 00:13:08,458
What was that about?

203
00:13:08,458 --> 00:13:11,208
Gone with the alcohol.

204
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:15,625
Drink alcohol, 
and you'll forget a lot of things.

205
00:13:15,625 --> 00:13:18,167
You screwed up, Gugu.

206
00:13:18,167 --> 00:13:21,292
But I have good news!

207
00:13:22,917 --> 00:13:24,625
It's finally complete!

208
00:13:24,625 --> 00:13:28,667
My latest work! The anti-treeman mask!

209
00:13:28,667 --> 00:13:29,917
Treeman?

210
00:13:29,917 --> 00:13:34,792
The thing that attacked you and Fushi
a few years back.

211
00:13:34,792 --> 00:13:37,208
So you made this for me?

212
00:13:37,208 --> 00:13:40,125
Yes. It took me a year.

213
00:13:40,125 --> 00:13:41,917
Hurry up and try it on.

214
00:13:44,042 --> 00:13:46,250
It's a bit heavy, 
but the functionality is great.

215
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:49,208
Even without a torch, you can create fire.

216
00:13:49,208 --> 00:13:52,458
Try shutting the lid hard.

217
00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:56,125
Using the pressure created, it sets fire 
to gunpowder balls concentrated at the nose!

218
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:01,458
Amazing! You're the best, Grandpa Beer!

219
00:14:01,458 --> 00:14:03,708
With this, 
it'll be easier for you to get the girl!

220
00:14:03,708 --> 00:14:05,083
Take this to that party,

221
00:14:05,083 --> 00:14:06,667
and you'll be the center of attention!

222
00:14:06,667 --> 00:14:07,917
Thanks!

223
00:14:07,917 --> 00:14:10,917
TO YOUR ETERNITY

224
00:14:11,167 --> 00:14:12,750
Well, then...

225
00:14:13,542 --> 00:14:15,250
Fushi, it's time! Let's go!

226
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:17,708
We don't want to be late to Rynn's party!

227
00:14:17,708 --> 00:14:22,333
Gugu, how about I empty 
the alcohol just for today?

228
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:24,917
So you can eat plenty of good food.

229
00:14:24,917 --> 00:14:26,333
It's fine.

230
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:29,250
The enemy might attack at any time.

231
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:31,875
We can't let our guard down even for a second.

232
00:14:33,958 --> 00:14:35,500
Well, we're off.

233
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:38,000
Wait, Gugu.

234
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,542
You're a really great kid.

235
00:14:41,542 --> 00:14:45,667
We're not blood-related,
but I think of you as my own grandson.

236
00:14:45,667 --> 00:14:48,583
What's with this so suddenly?
So disgusting.

237
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:49,667
Sorry, sorry.

238
00:14:49,667 --> 00:14:51,667
Be careful out there.

239
00:14:51,667 --> 00:14:53,667
Leaving the shop in your care.

240
00:14:53,667 --> 00:14:55,958
Hey, how do you use a map?

241
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,042
What are you crying over?

242
00:15:00,042 --> 00:15:02,750
They're only away for a day.

243
00:15:04,375 --> 00:15:07,083
I'm just a little worried.

244
00:15:07,083 --> 00:15:08,958
Seeing them reach that age...

245
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:11,708
makes me so emotional.

246
00:15:11,708 --> 00:15:16,167
Why is it that I have to be an old man?

247
00:15:16,167 --> 00:15:21,042
I would be so sad to die first.

248
00:15:21,042 --> 00:15:24,208
He has left home and become an adult.

249
00:15:24,208 --> 00:15:27,375
He found a path he loves 
and will continue to pursue it.

250
00:15:27,375 --> 00:15:31,292
I want to see him live that life.

251
00:15:31,292 --> 00:15:36,792
I would be happy to die 
once I've seen it in its entirety.

252
00:15:40,625 --> 00:15:42,292
What's that you're carrying?

253
00:15:42,292 --> 00:15:43,625
Vegetables.

254
00:15:43,625 --> 00:15:47,708
Pioran said we should bring presents.

255
00:15:47,708 --> 00:15:50,000
What are you going to give her, Gugu?

256
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,083
I'm planning to buy something.

257
00:15:53,125 --> 00:15:55,333
Ah, there it is!

258
00:15:55,333 --> 00:15:57,875
-Hello.
-Welcome...

259
00:15:57,875 --> 00:15:58,917
Welcome.

260
00:15:58,917 --> 00:16:01,292
Could I get that purple flower, please?

261
00:16:01,292 --> 00:16:02,500
Flower?

262
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:08,667
When I consider what Rynn might like,
this is all that I can imagine.

263
00:16:08,667 --> 00:16:11,875
This is a dream bellflower.

264
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:21,000
We're here!

265
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
This is Rynn's house!

266
00:16:24,542 --> 00:16:26,958
Wow, they live in such a big place!

267
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:29,208
The floor is so smooth.

268
00:16:29,208 --> 00:16:31,542
Look, Fushi! So much food!

269
00:16:31,542 --> 00:16:32,750
Let's take some.

270
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:34,708
You like pork, right?

271
00:16:34,708 --> 00:16:37,042
There are noodles too. Oh, and spring rolls.

272
00:16:37,042 --> 00:16:38,833
For drinks, they have grape juice.

273
00:16:38,833 --> 00:16:41,083
And peach jelly for dessert.

274
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:42,667
Who are they?

275
00:16:42,667 --> 00:16:45,583
Wearing a mask at a celebratory party...

276
00:16:45,583 --> 00:16:48,250
How are they related to Rynn?

277
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:50,500
Rynn has so many friends.

278
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,500
There are about a hundred people here.

279
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:55,458
Even though Rynn's our only friend.

280
00:16:57,042 --> 00:16:58,875
It's an honor to have you here.

281
00:16:59,875 --> 00:17:01,583
Rynn.

282
00:17:01,583 --> 00:17:03,833
Thanks for coming today.

283
00:17:03,833 --> 00:17:09,083
Look, Rynn. Grandpa made a new mask for Gugu.

284
00:17:09,083 --> 00:17:11,917
Wow, it's amazing!

285
00:17:16,666 --> 00:17:18,582
Hey, Rynn...

286
00:17:18,583 --> 00:17:22,500
I want to ask you about the other day...

287
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:27,125
Oh, that? I'm sorry I threw 
the sweet potato at you!

288
00:17:27,125 --> 00:17:29,042
Sweet potato?

289
00:17:29,042 --> 00:17:31,250
Did it break your mask?

290
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:32,875
Is that why you got a new one?

291
00:17:32,875 --> 00:17:34,542
I'm so sorry!

292
00:17:34,542 --> 00:17:36,708
No, nothing like that...

293
00:17:36,708 --> 00:17:40,125
Oh, what's this? Presents?

294
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:41,875
Yes. Vegetables.

295
00:17:41,875 --> 00:17:43,667
Thank you!

296
00:17:43,667 --> 00:17:45,625
And Gugu too.

297
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:47,958
For you.

298
00:17:47,958 --> 00:17:50,375
Happy Sixteenth Birthday.

299
00:17:53,167 --> 00:17:54,875
I remember that flower...

300
00:17:54,875 --> 00:17:57,250
What is he trying to pull?

301
00:17:57,250 --> 00:18:01,542
Gugu, why did you choose this flower?

302
00:18:01,542 --> 00:18:04,833
Well... I thought you would like it...

303
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:06,042
It's purple, after all.

304
00:18:06,042 --> 00:18:11,417
That is the flower Rynn was carrying
four years ago when the incident on the cliff occurred.

305
00:18:11,417 --> 00:18:14,250
Do you wish to hurt her?

306
00:18:15,625 --> 00:18:18,125
I'm sorry, Rynn! I didn't mean to...

307
00:18:21,292 --> 00:18:24,583
It's fine. Well, have fun.

308
00:18:25,792 --> 00:18:28,792
-I screwed up!
-What happened with the sweet potato?

309
00:18:35,333 --> 00:18:37,042
What a pretty flower.

310
00:18:37,042 --> 00:18:38,875
I wonder what it's called?

311
00:18:38,875 --> 00:18:41,500
I want a dress in this color.

312
00:18:47,708 --> 00:18:53,167
I saw it that day for the first time...
But I haven't seen this flower since.

313
00:18:53,167 --> 00:18:55,708
Rynn, that flower...

314
00:18:55,708 --> 00:18:57,042
I'll get rid of it for you.

315
00:18:57,042 --> 00:18:58,917
It'll bring up painful memories.

316
00:18:58,917 --> 00:19:00,292
No.

317
00:19:00,292 --> 00:19:03,417
It's the first present he gave me.

318
00:19:03,958 --> 00:19:06,333
Hey, handsome.

319
00:19:06,333 --> 00:19:07,333
You in the mask.

320
00:19:07,333 --> 00:19:09,125
I'm talking about you.

321
00:19:09,792 --> 00:19:13,167
I saw what happened earlier.
Don't you think you're being rude?

322
00:19:13,167 --> 00:19:16,875
Take off the mask. This is a party.

323
00:19:16,875 --> 00:19:19,542
Ah, I see. But sorry, I can't.

324
00:19:19,542 --> 00:19:21,083
What do you mean you can't?

325
00:19:22,417 --> 00:19:25,000
-Hey, wait...
-That mask is inappropriate!

326
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:33,042
What happened?

327
00:19:33,042 --> 00:19:36,208
This guy just fell on his own.

328
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:37,792
Quick, get a towel!

329
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:41,083
-Here you go.
-My lady, you'll get wet!

330
00:19:41,083 --> 00:19:43,542
Here. Let's wipe your face.

331
00:19:46,875 --> 00:19:53,625
Oh, dear. At this rate,
you'll never be able to kiss anyone.

332
00:19:57,250 --> 00:20:01,000
My lady, your father is calling.

333
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,083
All right.

334
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:05,292
Wipe yourself down, so you don't catch a cold!

335
00:20:06,625 --> 00:20:09,083
Rynn, I have someone to introduce.

336
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:11,375
Your fiance.

337
00:20:14,375 --> 00:20:16,375
So you're Rynn.

338
00:20:16,375 --> 00:20:18,750
Your eyes are so big and cute.

339
00:20:34,417 --> 00:20:37,208
Let's head back, Fushi.

340
00:20:37,208 --> 00:20:39,542
What? I still want to eat.

341
00:20:39,542 --> 00:20:48,458
Fushi, I thought the days Rynn
would come over and play would continue forever.

342
00:20:48,458 --> 00:20:51,458
But... Things are going to change from now on.

343
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:53,792
Why?

344
00:20:53,792 --> 00:20:57,875
Because... Those are the rules, I guess.

345
00:20:57,875 --> 00:20:59,458
Who decided on those rules?

346
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:05,292
You must be the one to choose how you live!

347
00:21:05,292 --> 00:21:06,375
Gugu!

348
00:21:08,667 --> 00:21:11,667
Did you come up with that line?

349
00:21:11,667 --> 00:21:12,625
No.

350
00:21:16,125 --> 00:21:19,167
Go ahead and eat. I'll wait for you outside.

351
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:35,125
Gugu!

352
00:21:38,917 --> 00:21:40,917
Are you leaving already?

353
00:21:40,917 --> 00:21:44,750
Are you angry about what happened earlier?

354
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:47,208
No. I'm used to it.

355
00:21:51,042 --> 00:21:54,042
You might not want to talk about it...

356
00:21:54,042 --> 00:21:56,583
But I want to ask you again...

357
00:21:56,583 --> 00:21:59,875
About that mask. And your scars.

358
00:22:01,792 --> 00:22:03,000
Don't worry!

359
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,292
I know I won't hate you no matter what you say!

360
00:22:12,042 --> 00:22:14,250
I fell from a cliff.

361
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:15,958
According to Grandpa Beer,

362
00:22:15,958 --> 00:22:19,792
when he found me, 
a log had cracked open my head.

363
00:22:19,792 --> 00:22:22,208
And my face had been smashed in.

364
00:22:23,417 --> 00:22:26,875
Why did you fall off a cliff?

365
00:22:26,875 --> 00:22:29,417
A log was rolling down a hill.

366
00:22:29,417 --> 00:22:31,833
And there was a person toward the bottom.

367
00:22:31,833 --> 00:22:34,458
I tried calling out, but they didn't hear.

368
00:22:34,458 --> 00:22:37,042
I ran and tried to save her.

369
00:22:37,042 --> 00:22:39,208
And that's where I screwed up.

370
00:22:39,208 --> 00:22:42,292
Why would you keep that a secret?

371
00:22:42,292 --> 00:22:44,417
You did something amazing.

372
00:22:46,042 --> 00:22:48,875
Because I screwed up big time.

373
00:22:50,458 --> 00:22:54,000
Were you unable to save her?

374
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,792
No. For what it's worth, I saved her.

375
00:22:56,792 --> 00:22:58,750
But...

376
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:01,292
But they were left with a scar about this size.

377
00:23:01,292 --> 00:23:06,583
Compared to yours, that's just a scratch!

378
00:23:06,583 --> 00:23:10,667
But to her, it was a large wound.

379
00:23:10,667 --> 00:23:13,417
And they were incredibly worried about it.

380
00:23:13,417 --> 00:23:16,792
It was embarrassing and couldn't be shown.

381
00:23:16,792 --> 00:23:19,375
I thought I had done a horrible thing.

382
00:23:31,167 --> 00:23:35,167
But you saved her life!

383
00:23:41,208 --> 00:23:44,125
Can I take a guess, Gugu?

384
00:23:45,958 --> 00:23:49,000
That day, the wind was strong.

385
00:23:51,708 --> 00:23:54,917
And there was a river nearby.

386
00:23:58,208 --> 00:24:01,958
It was evening. The flowers were in bloom.

387
00:24:04,458 --> 00:24:06,833
She was holding...

388
00:24:06,833 --> 00:24:09,208
A purple flower!

389
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,583
Yes. The flower she was holding... 
It, too, was a dream bellflower.

390
00:24:27,458 --> 00:24:29,875
Gugu, I...

391
00:24:42,917 --> 00:24:44,750
Gugu!

392
00:24:45,625 --> 00:24:47,917
The Knockers are here.
