1
00:00:05,792 --> 00:00:09,667
At first, "it" was a sphere.

2
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:13,583
Not just any normal sphere.

3
00:00:13,583 --> 00:00:20,208
"It" could change itself by imitating
all that may and does exist.

4
00:00:20,208 --> 00:00:23,583
I decided to place "it" upon this land

5
00:00:23,583 --> 00:00:26,000
and observe it.

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,708
For some time,
it assumed the form of a rock.

7
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:46,042
When temperatures rose,

8
00:00:46,042 --> 00:00:49,417
it copied the appearance of moss.

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,083
Before long,
snow began to fall upon this land.

10
00:01:04,958 --> 00:01:09,250
A single wolf
came ambling from the south,

11
00:01:20,042 --> 00:01:23,833
and once it tired...

12
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:38,125
"It" took the form of an animal...

13
00:01:43,875 --> 00:01:46,750
and gained consciousness.

14
00:01:47,708 --> 00:01:49,958
It did not know
how to move or where to go,

15
00:01:49,958 --> 00:01:53,375
but it picked up the wolf's habits instantly.

16
00:01:53,375 --> 00:01:55,167
Its movements were slow.

17
00:01:55,167 --> 00:01:58,125
Evidently, it had copied
the injured wolf's wounds as well...

18
00:01:58,125 --> 00:02:00,333
Its initial discomfort...

19
00:02:00,333 --> 00:02:03,292
and its initial pain...

20
00:02:03,292 --> 00:02:06,792
healed within 20 seconds.

21
00:02:06,792 --> 00:02:08,583
And it continued on without issue.

22
00:02:10,083 --> 00:02:13,208
"It" began to walk.

23
00:02:13,917 --> 00:02:20,625
Carving into its mind, the frostiness
of the wind and the smell of the snow.

24
00:02:20,625 --> 00:02:22,792
Yet, it had no destination.

25
00:02:28,208 --> 00:02:31,917
TO YOUR ETERNITY

26
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:53,458
Joan! You're finally back!

27
00:02:54,958 --> 00:02:58,500
I'm so glad you're safe!

28
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,667
You've been gone for two months.
I was so worried!

29
00:03:00,667 --> 00:03:04,375
I knew you wouldn't forget about me!

30
00:03:05,125 --> 00:03:08,792
You seem quieter than usual.

31
00:03:08,792 --> 00:03:11,958
I know. You must be tired.

32
00:03:18,167 --> 00:03:21,708
There were many unfamiliar things there.

33
00:03:24,292 --> 00:03:27,708
The comfort of warmth...

34
00:03:31,667 --> 00:03:34,583
and unknown fragrances.

35
00:03:34,583 --> 00:03:37,208
This place was enchanting.

36
00:03:37,208 --> 00:03:39,625
If it could speak, it would probably say,

37
00:03:39,625 --> 00:03:43,375
"I want to stay here forever."

38
00:03:43,375 --> 00:03:46,625
I'm always telling you
not to get too close to the fire.

39
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,292
Here's your food.

40
00:03:59,958 --> 00:04:01,292
Here.

41
00:04:04,167 --> 00:04:05,667
Hm?

42
00:04:05,667 --> 00:04:08,500
I see. This isn't caribou milk.

43
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,750
You must not like it.

44
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,375
Well, there's no helping it.

45
00:04:12,375 --> 00:04:15,625
The last caribou died a year ago...

46
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:20,708
The fire will go out soon.

47
00:04:20,708 --> 00:04:22,958
Let's sleep before it gets cold.

48
00:04:27,167 --> 00:04:30,292
That nameless boy

49
00:04:30,292 --> 00:04:34,292
was the first human "it" met.

50
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:47,250
"Episode 1: THE FINAL ONE"

51
00:04:55,417 --> 00:04:58,792
After it snows,
it's hard to get dry stuff.

52
00:04:58,792 --> 00:05:01,417
We can't use the wood at my aunt's place.

53
00:05:01,417 --> 00:05:04,958
It's like we're borrowing
from people's houses. Isn't that something?

54
00:05:04,958 --> 00:05:07,167
I'm sorry. I know it well.

55
00:05:07,167 --> 00:05:09,958
If they came back,
they'd probably be angry...

56
00:05:12,208 --> 00:05:13,792
Well, it can't be helped!

57
00:05:13,792 --> 00:05:16,417
If I don't do this, I'll die!

58
00:05:18,667 --> 00:05:19,958
Of course, they will!

59
00:05:19,958 --> 00:05:23,917
It's only been five years
since they left! Only five years!

60
00:05:23,917 --> 00:05:26,417
They left for a place far away...

61
00:05:26,417 --> 00:05:29,167
Far beyond the horizon,

62
00:05:31,292 --> 00:05:34,917
believing that there,

63
00:05:34,917 --> 00:05:37,542
they would find people and food.

64
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:46,875
According to them,
that place is like a paradise.

65
00:05:46,875 --> 00:05:48,375
There are lots of fish

66
00:05:48,375 --> 00:05:52,458
and even something they call "fruit".

67
00:05:52,458 --> 00:05:55,375
There are people far smarter than us

68
00:05:55,375 --> 00:05:58,125
who live happily every day.

69
00:05:59,333 --> 00:06:02,708
How nice... I would've liked to go.

70
00:06:02,708 --> 00:06:03,833
Remember?

71
00:06:03,833 --> 00:06:06,333
I was trying to sneak out with all the adults,

72
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:09,083
but you stopped me from going.

73
00:06:09,083 --> 00:06:10,708
By biting my leg!

74
00:06:10,708 --> 00:06:15,417
Then, they told me,
"You stay here! Look after the elderly!"

75
00:06:15,417 --> 00:06:17,208
That was so mean...

76
00:06:17,208 --> 00:06:22,583
They said they'd come back
with souvenirs if they found that place...

77
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:24,875
They did say that, right?

78
00:06:24,875 --> 00:06:27,375
In the end, the ones left behind...

79
00:06:27,375 --> 00:06:31,292
were the elderly I couldn't save...

80
00:06:31,292 --> 00:06:32,958
and the two of us...

81
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:44,375
Joan!

82
00:07:02,792 --> 00:07:04,417
Please...

83
00:07:05,708 --> 00:07:06,875
Welcome back...

84
00:07:22,583 --> 00:07:25,042
What a surprise! It's a fish!

85
00:07:25,042 --> 00:07:27,542
Hooray! What a big catch!

86
00:07:29,875 --> 00:07:31,458
Here, this is for you.

87
00:07:33,542 --> 00:07:35,542
To save fuel,

88
00:07:35,542 --> 00:07:36,917
let's eat this raw.

89
00:07:44,125 --> 00:07:46,292
Why won't you eat it?

90
00:07:46,292 --> 00:07:48,708
Did you forget how?

91
00:07:48,708 --> 00:07:49,917
Here...

92
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:52,875
Like this...

93
00:07:52,875 --> 00:07:55,417
With your mouth... Chew it...

94
00:07:56,625 --> 00:07:58,250
Here!

95
00:08:06,917 --> 00:08:08,167
Here.

96
00:08:13,083 --> 00:08:15,708
Well, you can eat it after all.

97
00:08:31,083 --> 00:08:33,582
These are aunty and uncle.

98
00:08:33,582 --> 00:08:36,374
My cousin and his children.

99
00:08:36,375 --> 00:08:38,582
And the uncle with a beard down the road.

100
00:08:38,582 --> 00:08:40,541
This is the aunty next door.

101
00:08:40,542 --> 00:08:41,625
It looks like her, doesn't it?

102
00:08:43,957 --> 00:08:47,208
So that there's evidence
that people were here...

103
00:08:47,208 --> 00:08:51,417
And so I that I don't forget.

104
00:08:53,542 --> 00:08:54,792
Joan.

105
00:08:54,792 --> 00:08:57,292
I'm thinking of leaving this place.

106
00:08:57,292 --> 00:08:58,875
I want to meet new people

107
00:08:58,875 --> 00:09:01,167
and have new experiences.

108
00:09:01,167 --> 00:09:03,875
Surely there'll be some bad things mixed in,

109
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:07,792
but I want to see the world.

110
00:09:07,792 --> 00:09:11,250
With you, of course.

111
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,458
I can't even see the sea anymore!

112
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:39,208
It's my first time coming this far out.

113
00:09:39,208 --> 00:09:41,500
Uncle said it was...

114
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:42,750
directly south.

115
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:45,958
Just walk straight ahead from the house.

116
00:09:47,792 --> 00:09:49,375
You can't see it in these conditions,

117
00:09:49,375 --> 00:09:52,625
but eventually, a big
wall-like mountain will appear.

118
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:54,583
Beyond that is paradise.

119
00:09:56,708 --> 00:09:59,958
Well, let's go further before it gets dark!

120
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:17,583
What is that?

121
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:26,000
It's a message!

122
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,417
For people like us
who are searching for that paradise!

123
00:10:29,417 --> 00:10:31,917
It says to go this way!

124
00:10:31,917 --> 00:10:32,667
Awesome!

125
00:10:32,667 --> 00:10:33,625
This is such a relief!

126
00:10:33,625 --> 00:10:36,542
Joan, coming here was worth it!

127
00:10:38,583 --> 00:10:40,958
I'm happy too!

128
00:10:42,917 --> 00:10:45,500
Joan, have you ever heard of "vegetables"?

129
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:49,708
Apparently, I've had them before,
but I can't remember at all.

130
00:10:49,708 --> 00:10:52,958
And sweet, round "fruits"!

131
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:54,875
I don't know what "sweet" tastes like,

132
00:10:54,875 --> 00:10:58,333
so I asked uncle, but he couldn't
really explain it either.

133
00:10:58,333 --> 00:11:00,250
I'd like to try it soon.

134
00:11:01,125 --> 00:11:03,208
I can't wait...

135
00:11:03,208 --> 00:11:05,792
Freedom feels great!

136
00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:40,292
It's starting to snow...

137
00:11:42,667 --> 00:11:44,958
Is that a complaint I hear, Joan?

138
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:47,625
The journey has only just started!

139
00:11:54,458 --> 00:11:55,958
Look! A tree!

140
00:11:55,958 --> 00:11:59,167
Amazing! This is proof
we're getting closer to the mountains!

141
00:11:59,167 --> 00:12:01,250
We can use some of this as fuel!

142
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:04,708
All right!

143
00:12:05,542 --> 00:12:07,208
Let's resume our journey!

144
00:12:18,417 --> 00:12:19,958
Ah, that was embarrassing!

145
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:22,208
My face is freezing!

146
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:23,833
I'm completely soaked!

147
00:12:23,833 --> 00:12:24,958
But it's amazing!

148
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:26,333
To think there'd be a river here!

149
00:12:26,333 --> 00:12:27,917
Let's fish!

150
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:32,625
You were smiling just now, weren't you?

151
00:12:52,583 --> 00:12:54,208
There. That'll do.

152
00:12:57,208 --> 00:12:59,583
It's fine. Don't worry.

153
00:12:59,583 --> 00:13:01,458
It's just a flesh wound.

154
00:13:03,125 --> 00:13:05,375
Hey, don't joke around.

155
00:13:05,375 --> 00:13:07,167
I'm not going back.

156
00:13:07,167 --> 00:13:09,458
I can't do something that uncool.

157
00:13:09,458 --> 00:13:11,958
And we still have plenty of food.

158
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:15,417
Let's keep going tomorrow.

159
00:13:15,417 --> 00:13:17,292
The day after tomorrow
and the day after that,

160
00:13:17,292 --> 00:13:19,708
I'll keep walking, even if you complain!

161
00:13:19,708 --> 00:13:22,167
As long as I have strength, I'll keep going!

162
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:57,208
That's not right, Joan.

163
00:13:57,208 --> 00:14:01,667
To stop going further
because we don't know if they're alive...

164
00:14:01,667 --> 00:14:04,125
is even more foolish.

165
00:14:04,125 --> 00:14:07,708
If we return, we'll only rot away in that house.

166
00:14:07,708 --> 00:14:09,958
I can't accept that!

167
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:11,833
I will go to where they all have gone!

168
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:15,292
I have nothing else to do but that!

169
00:14:15,292 --> 00:14:18,208
The fact that they haven't returned

170
00:14:18,208 --> 00:14:20,667
surely means that paradise is too fascinating!

171
00:14:20,667 --> 00:14:23,875
It's because they're enjoying it so much...

172
00:14:23,875 --> 00:14:28,208
The fascinating food
and the fascinating people...

173
00:14:28,208 --> 00:14:29,458
That's why...

174
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:32,792
This is amazing, Joan!

175
00:15:32,792 --> 00:15:35,292
These are the remains of people!

176
00:15:35,292 --> 00:15:36,500
Look at this!

177
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:39,042
This means that everyone made it this far!

178
00:15:39,042 --> 00:15:41,000
That's why...

179
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,958
For sure, ahead of us...

180
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:45,125
is the way to the mountains!

181
00:15:45,125 --> 00:15:48,625
We can definitely make it!

182
00:15:48,625 --> 00:15:50,417
We can make it...

183
00:15:54,375 --> 00:15:57,750
Can we... make it?

184
00:16:02,375 --> 00:16:05,917
What do you think, Joan?

185
00:16:05,917 --> 00:16:08,792
Do you think we can make it?

186
00:16:08,792 --> 00:16:10,750
Tell me!

187
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:14,333
Say something... Like you always do...

188
00:16:15,458 --> 00:16:19,042
That's right... You can't reply...

189
00:16:19,042 --> 00:16:21,750
That's right... Isn't it?

190
00:16:22,875 --> 00:16:28,708
I've only been talking to myself all along...

191
00:16:28,708 --> 00:16:31,917
Curse it! Curse it all!

192
00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:45,833
That's right...

193
00:16:45,833 --> 00:16:48,083
I'm sorry, Joan.

194
00:16:49,167 --> 00:16:52,292
Even though you've been with me for so long...

195
00:16:52,292 --> 00:16:54,333
I'm saying... these things...

196
00:16:55,167 --> 00:16:58,917
Sorry... I'm sorry...

197
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:05,000
Let's go back...

198
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,708
Let's go back, Joan.

199
00:17:10,916 --> 00:17:12,916
I've decided...

200
00:17:12,916 --> 00:17:16,666
It's not your fault... I want to go back...

201
00:17:16,666 --> 00:17:19,082
I want to go back...

202
00:17:19,083 --> 00:17:20,583
Let's go back.

203
00:18:03,208 --> 00:18:05,417
What's with that face?

204
00:18:10,708 --> 00:18:12,750
Are you not feeling well?

205
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:17,000
Or are you trying to make me laugh?

206
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,917
I know, I know.

207
00:18:18,917 --> 00:18:20,500
You must be hungry.

208
00:18:24,042 --> 00:18:26,625
I'll prepare some food.

209
00:18:37,167 --> 00:18:39,542
It's healing.

210
00:18:41,875 --> 00:18:44,667
Does it smell nice?

211
00:18:44,667 --> 00:18:46,542
Once this heals,

212
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:49,333
let's challenge ourselves again, Joan!

213
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:04,542
That's weird...

214
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,125
Chair...

215
00:19:45,458 --> 00:19:46,958
You see...

216
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,708
If... If I'm sleeping
when they all come back...

217
00:19:51,708 --> 00:19:55,042
That would be embarrassing, right?

218
00:19:57,292 --> 00:19:58,958
Determination...

219
00:19:59,958 --> 00:20:02,292
is what...

220
00:20:02,292 --> 00:20:04,292
makes me cool.

221
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:10,875
Joan... I...

222
00:20:10,875 --> 00:20:13,750
have a request to make of you.

223
00:20:14,833 --> 00:20:19,750
Don't ever...

224
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:22,583
forget about me.

225
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:51,583
All right! Let's head out
to paradise one more time!

226
00:21:53,875 --> 00:21:55,167
Joan!

227
00:21:56,583 --> 00:21:58,292
Everyone!

228
00:21:58,875 --> 00:22:02,125
They were all waiting for me.

229
00:22:02,125 --> 00:22:04,417
I won't be alone anymore.

230
00:22:04,417 --> 00:22:06,792
Now I can do my best!

231
00:22:06,792 --> 00:22:09,667
Look, everyone! There are people up ahead!

232
00:22:09,667 --> 00:22:11,333
Hello.

233
00:22:11,333 --> 00:22:12,542
It's nice to meet you.

234
00:22:12,542 --> 00:22:14,792
What kind of place is this?

235
00:22:14,792 --> 00:22:17,000
Do you know about something called "fruit"?

236
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,292
Hello, nice to meet you!

237
00:22:19,292 --> 00:22:20,750
My name is...

238
00:22:27,583 --> 00:22:29,250
Thus...

239
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:32,708
"It" acquired the form of a human.

240
00:22:34,542 --> 00:22:37,750
There are conditions to this transformation.

241
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:40,208
There must be an "impetus".

242
00:22:40,208 --> 00:22:44,417
And so it set out to seek
an even stronger stimulus.

243
00:22:44,417 --> 00:22:48,083
It will likely meet all sorts of people

244
00:22:48,083 --> 00:22:51,042
and have all kinds of experiences,

245
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:57,208
just as the boy wished.

246
00:24:30,667 --> 00:24:35,667
"It" arrives in the land of Ninannah.

247
00:24:35,667 --> 00:24:40,125
March, a girl raised in the village

248
00:24:40,125 --> 00:24:44,125
was selected as a sacrifice.

249
00:24:44,125 --> 00:24:49,708
Her dream of becoming
an adult was thus shattered.

250
00:24:49,708 --> 00:24:51,333
To survive,

251
00:24:51,333 --> 00:24:54,167
"Episode 2 THE DISOBEDIENT GIRL"
the two lives intertwine.
