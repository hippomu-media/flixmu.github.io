1
00:00:03,167 --> 00:00:05,958
I created you.

2
00:00:09,167 --> 00:00:12,625
We have a great goal.

3
00:00:14,375 --> 00:00:17,417
To "preserve" this world.

4
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:26,208
And this is something
created to impede our progress.

5
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:47,000
Now, then, Fushi, let's have fun.

6
00:00:47,708 --> 00:00:50,500
Until the end arrives.

7
00:02:20,542 --> 00:02:22,917
TO YOUR ETERNITY

8
00:02:26,833 --> 00:02:28,917
I was thinking recently.

9
00:02:30,375 --> 00:02:33,958
Why am I who I am?

10
00:02:33,958 --> 00:02:38,375
Why weren't we born 
into that mansion over there?

11
00:02:38,375 --> 00:02:40,417
I think of that too.

12
00:02:40,417 --> 00:02:44,542
And that's why 
we're working hard every day like this,

13
00:02:44,542 --> 00:02:45,792
right?

14
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:49,417
To get money.

15
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:55,750
And one day

16
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:58,250
build a grand house like that.

17
00:02:58,250 --> 00:02:59,583
We'll live in it together.

18
00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:07,000
EPISODE SEVEN: THE BOY WHO WANTS TO CHANGE

19
00:03:11,667 --> 00:03:13,833
Let's get to work!

20
00:03:13,833 --> 00:03:16,833
Shin, you tend to the fields.

21
00:03:16,833 --> 00:03:19,375
Gugu, sell these vegetables at the market.

22
00:03:19,375 --> 00:03:21,333
Don't leave a single one unsold.

23
00:03:21,333 --> 00:03:22,792
Yes, mister!

24
00:03:31,167 --> 00:03:32,583
Welcome!

25
00:03:33,208 --> 00:03:35,083
Welcome!

26
00:03:40,833 --> 00:03:43,958
That girl always passes by.

27
00:03:43,958 --> 00:03:45,625
I wonder what name is.

28
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:47,500
Is she from the mansion?

29
00:03:50,792 --> 00:03:53,500
Do you sell seeds here?

30
00:03:54,417 --> 00:03:56,875
No, sorry. We don't.

31
00:03:56,875 --> 00:03:59,875
I'll ask mister.

32
00:03:59,875 --> 00:04:03,000
Thank you. Bye.

33
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,500
That old man is as odd as ever.

34
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,000
Do you know him?

35
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,083
He sells alcohol on the hills.

36
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:11,917
Rumor is he does some work
that might as well be called crime.

37
00:04:19,916 --> 00:04:21,332
I'm back, Brother!

38
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:23,375
-Someone gave us food.
-See you, Shin.

39
00:04:23,375 --> 00:04:24,792
You better win tomorrow!

40
00:04:24,792 --> 00:04:26,500
Okay. See you!

41
00:04:28,625 --> 00:04:30,250
Who were they?

42
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:33,667
Friends. I got to know them recently.

43
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:42,125
Huh?

44
00:04:43,375 --> 00:04:45,083
We're short...

45
00:04:46,167 --> 00:04:49,208
Brother, did you spend any today?

46
00:04:49,208 --> 00:04:51,167
Of course not!

47
00:04:51,167 --> 00:04:52,833
But we're short one bundle.

48
00:04:52,833 --> 00:04:54,458
Did someone take them?

49
00:04:54,458 --> 00:04:56,917
Those guys earlier didn't see the box, right?

50
00:04:56,917 --> 00:04:59,042
Don't doubt my friends!

51
00:04:59,042 --> 00:05:02,042
Oh, yes... Sorry...

52
00:05:02,042 --> 00:05:05,083
I just heard that
there were some dangerous people nearby...

53
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,958
But this is really a shock...

54
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,208
It can't be helped if it was stolen.

55
00:05:12,208 --> 00:05:14,125
Don't get so upset.

56
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,292
Yes, that's right.

57
00:05:18,292 --> 00:05:20,750
We just need to work and earn more money.

58
00:05:22,083 --> 00:05:24,500
To make sure, I'll put it in the tree.

59
00:05:26,667 --> 00:05:29,875
Someone gave me a steamed bun.
Do you want half of it?

60
00:05:29,875 --> 00:05:31,083
No, I'm not hungry.

61
00:05:41,292 --> 00:05:44,708
Hey, there. Are you hungry?

62
00:05:44,708 --> 00:05:46,250
Here. Have some.

63
00:05:48,083 --> 00:05:50,000
Both of us have it hard...

64
00:05:54,292 --> 00:05:56,208
Welcome, welcome!

65
00:05:59,292 --> 00:06:02,458
Oh, you're the dog from yesterday!

66
00:06:02,458 --> 00:06:05,250
Sorry, I don't have any buns today!

67
00:06:06,708 --> 00:06:08,125
Myrr?

68
00:06:08,125 --> 00:06:10,125
So that's your name!

69
00:06:10,125 --> 00:06:11,583
Myrr!

70
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,250
-Myrr!
-It's her!

71
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:15,542
Myrr!

72
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,292
Ex...

73
00:06:19,292 --> 00:06:20,750
Excuse me...

74
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:22,917
Are you looking for this dog?

75
00:06:25,292 --> 00:06:27,958
Myrr, I finally found you!

76
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:32,500
I have to thank you.

77
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,083
How about this?

78
00:06:34,083 --> 00:06:37,708
My lady, that was a present from your father.

79
00:06:37,708 --> 00:06:39,042
It's all right.

80
00:06:39,042 --> 00:06:43,250
He bought it
even though I don't like this color.

81
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:48,083
If you sell this,
you'll never have to sell vegetables again!

82
00:06:50,167 --> 00:06:52,542
She knew about me!

83
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:55,458
Um... What's your name?

84
00:06:55,458 --> 00:06:57,583
That was a rude way of speaking.

85
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:01,083
Huh? But I was encouraging him.

86
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:09,792
I'm back, Brother!

87
00:07:09,792 --> 00:07:12,125
Something good happened today!

88
00:07:16,875 --> 00:07:19,833
Brother?

89
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:42,208
This world has a conception of "fate".

90
00:07:42,208 --> 00:07:44,417
I decided to oppose that.

91
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:47,292
I'm sorry, Gugu.

92
00:07:50,708 --> 00:07:52,583
Liar.

93
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:11,875
Why am I who I am?

94
00:08:14,583 --> 00:08:19,542
If you sell this, 
you'll never have to sell vegetables again.

95
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:34,292
If I were to crash into that...

96
00:08:34,292 --> 00:08:37,125
Bang. Boom. Crack.

97
00:08:37,125 --> 00:08:39,042
Would my fate change?

98
00:08:41,042 --> 00:08:43,833
That was a dumb thought.

99
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:56,292
Hey! Are you all right?

100
00:08:58,042 --> 00:08:59,375
One, two...

101
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:03,458
Dang. It won't budge.

102
00:09:03,458 --> 00:09:06,167
I'm going to get someone to help.
Can you watch this for me?

103
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:12,792
That was close.

104
00:09:12,792 --> 00:09:17,000
It was so fast that I almost actually died.

105
00:09:30,542 --> 00:09:32,875
Hey, you over there! It's dangerous!

106
00:09:38,208 --> 00:09:41,292
It's dangerous! Run!

107
00:09:59,917 --> 00:10:02,458
Someone... Save me...

108
00:10:06,375 --> 00:10:08,625
She's bleeding! Are you all right?

109
00:10:08,625 --> 00:10:10,667
Quick, get someone to tend to her injuries!

110
00:10:11,458 --> 00:10:13,333
She's awake!

111
00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:17,000
Rynn! Stay with me!

112
00:10:18,042 --> 00:10:22,458
-I see... Her name is Rynn.
-Help me carry her!

113
00:10:22,458 --> 00:10:25,667
-It's good she was saved...
-One, two!

114
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:27,792
-It's good...
-Master!

115
00:10:27,792 --> 00:10:31,250
Get her back to the house!

116
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:34,208
-You head back first too!
-Yes!

117
00:11:00,875 --> 00:11:02,375
Hurts...

118
00:11:04,708 --> 00:11:06,292
This place is...

119
00:11:08,625 --> 00:11:10,625
My body feels heavy...

120
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:19,917
I feel like... my stomach is swollen...

121
00:11:22,792 --> 00:11:26,708
My eyes... My mouth... My nose...

122
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,208
It's almost... As if...

123
00:11:31,208 --> 00:11:34,583
Your nose was destroyed, but you can still eat.

124
00:11:34,583 --> 00:11:38,167
I worked pretty hard to fix you up,
given the situation you were in.

125
00:11:38,167 --> 00:11:40,708
You're pretty lucky.

126
00:11:41,958 --> 00:11:47,292
I always dreamed 
of being someone other than myself.

127
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:50,667
My dream came true.

128
00:11:50,667 --> 00:11:54,667
I became a different being, a monster.

129
00:11:55,625 --> 00:11:58,375
Did you hear? That weird old man

130
00:11:58,375 --> 00:12:00,792
finally created a monster.

131
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:07,583
Are you here, old man?

132
00:12:09,125 --> 00:12:14,333
I brought you a great souvenir!

133
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:18,208
An immortal monster!

134
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:33,417
How about it? Isn't it amazing?

135
00:12:33,417 --> 00:12:36,250
And it's immortal, too?

136
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:40,292
Goodness. This is too much for my caliber.

137
00:12:40,292 --> 00:12:43,958
Where did you find it, old lady?

138
00:12:43,958 --> 00:12:46,750
The Yanome captured him.

139
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:49,208
Stuff happened, 
and now we're traveling together.

140
00:12:52,292 --> 00:12:54,625
H... Hello.

141
00:12:54,625 --> 00:12:55,958
I...

142
00:12:55,958 --> 00:12:59,292
I'm... the servant here. My name is Gugu.

143
00:12:59,292 --> 00:13:00,667
What's your name?

144
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,708
N... Name?

145
00:13:03,708 --> 00:13:06,708
Fushi.

146
00:13:06,708 --> 00:13:08,792
Oh, you're "immortal", 
that's why you're "Fushi"!

147
00:13:08,792 --> 00:13:10,292
That's all?

148
00:13:13,875 --> 00:13:17,083
Well, whatever. You're weird.

149
00:13:17,083 --> 00:13:20,500
Hey, Booze Man, can I show him around?

150
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,667
Sure.

151
00:13:22,708 --> 00:13:25,167
I heard you guys are going to stay here.

152
00:13:25,167 --> 00:13:28,750
I've been here for about three months now.

153
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:32,917
I was wounded badly back then.
But then Grandpa Beer saved me.

154
00:13:32,917 --> 00:13:35,917
He's weird, though.

155
00:13:35,917 --> 00:13:37,125
He's called Grandpa Beer or the Booze Man

156
00:13:37,125 --> 00:13:40,083
because he makes a lot of alcohol.

157
00:13:40,083 --> 00:13:43,625
He's a bit crazy though,
so we don't get many customers.

158
00:13:43,625 --> 00:13:46,250
Look! This is where we distill it.

159
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:48,292
What?

160
00:13:49,875 --> 00:13:52,583
Alcohol. What.

161
00:13:56,417 --> 00:13:57,750
Try some.

162
00:14:04,208 --> 00:14:08,042
Speaking of which,
you're wearing some run-down clothes.

163
00:14:08,042 --> 00:14:09,542
Dirty stuff isn't in fashion!

164
00:14:12,542 --> 00:14:14,167
Where are you going?

165
00:14:14,167 --> 00:14:16,125
We're heading down to the lake!

166
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:23,917
What's wrong?

167
00:14:23,917 --> 00:14:26,625
You're afraid of the woods, aren't you?

168
00:14:26,625 --> 00:14:28,042
Afraid?

169
00:14:28,042 --> 00:14:31,833
We were attacked 
by some weird being in the woods.

170
00:14:31,833 --> 00:14:35,042
It took the form of trees.

171
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:39,917
There are things an immortal fears?

172
00:14:39,917 --> 00:14:41,708
Afraid...

173
00:14:41,708 --> 00:14:43,958
Oh. I see.

174
00:14:43,958 --> 00:14:45,333
Afraid...

175
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:49,875
That old man will get angry at us
for using this water,

176
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:51,125
but who cares.

177
00:14:52,333 --> 00:14:55,333
Hm? Why are you injured?
Aren't you immortal?

178
00:14:57,583 --> 00:14:59,625
Don't you know?

179
00:14:59,625 --> 00:15:03,625
If you can't find a response,
you should say "I don't know".

180
00:15:03,625 --> 00:15:05,625
I don't know.

181
00:15:05,625 --> 00:15:07,917
Oh, you learn fast.

182
00:15:07,917 --> 00:15:10,667
Here. Take your clothes off.
I'll wash them.

183
00:15:11,917 --> 00:15:13,500
It's stuck?

184
00:15:14,083 --> 00:15:17,417
This too. And this too? Why?

185
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,417
Stop! I don't need to take it off!

186
00:15:24,417 --> 00:15:26,000
I'm ugly!

187
00:15:31,208 --> 00:15:33,500
See. Aren't I ugly?

188
00:15:35,417 --> 00:15:37,167
Hey, say something.

189
00:15:37,167 --> 00:15:40,167
What... ugly?

190
00:15:40,167 --> 00:15:43,792
A face that makes you laugh when you see it.

191
00:15:43,792 --> 00:15:45,833
Like a monster.

192
00:15:45,833 --> 00:15:49,583
Someone like me... 
who needs to spend their entire life hiding.

193
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:53,792
I understand, but I still haven't
gotten used to this lifestyle yet.

194
00:15:54,833 --> 00:15:56,208
Ugly.

195
00:15:57,250 --> 00:16:00,375
Well, we're both monsters, so let's be friends.

196
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:01,792
Ugly.

197
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:05,250
Listen, Fushi.

198
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:10,500
As long as you're here,
you'll need to learn how to work.

199
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:15,667
Say "yes" or something!

200
00:16:15,667 --> 00:16:17,958
Responding is the basis of human communication.

201
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:19,000
Yes.

202
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,292
Good!

203
00:16:20,292 --> 00:16:22,625
First thing in the morning, cleaning!

204
00:16:22,625 --> 00:16:23,542
Yes.

205
00:16:23,542 --> 00:16:25,292
Then, preparing food!

206
00:16:25,292 --> 00:16:26,125
Yes.

207
00:16:28,417 --> 00:16:29,917
Then working in the fields until noon!

208
00:16:29,917 --> 00:16:31,167
And tending to the store after that!

209
00:16:31,167 --> 00:16:32,083
Yes.

210
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:37,000
You're bigger than me, but how old are you?

211
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,458
I don't know.

212
00:16:39,292 --> 00:16:43,208
You know so little about yourself.

213
00:16:43,208 --> 00:16:46,292
Then, how about your parents?
Do you know their faces?

214
00:16:47,167 --> 00:16:48,542
I don't know.

215
00:16:48,542 --> 00:16:50,750
What... Parents?

216
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:52,958
We have to start from there?

217
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:58,083
Parents are people who work for your sake
out of unconditional love.

218
00:16:58,083 --> 00:17:01,625
What about siblings?
Anyone who grew up with you?

219
00:17:01,625 --> 00:17:03,292
I don't know.

220
00:17:03,292 --> 00:17:07,000
I had one. A cool older brother.

221
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,291
He left to go make money.

222
00:17:09,291 --> 00:17:12,624
One day, he'll be rich, and he'll come back.

223
00:17:13,208 --> 00:17:17,458
Maybe not knowing 
is a form of happiness in itself.

224
00:17:17,458 --> 00:17:19,916
You have no need for despair.

225
00:17:19,916 --> 00:17:21,874
I envy you.

226
00:17:26,833 --> 00:17:30,250
So what are we going to do about this guy?

227
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:34,208
Don't ask me, I'm just a brewer.

228
00:17:34,208 --> 00:17:39,000
If the world finds out about
something as rare as this, there'll be war.

229
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:43,583
Is that so?

230
00:17:43,583 --> 00:17:47,042
Before that happens, I'll protect him!

231
00:17:47,042 --> 00:17:49,292
Tasty. Tasty.

232
00:17:49,292 --> 00:17:54,500
I bet there are a lot of people
who would pay a lot of money for him.

233
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:57,083
What? You can't sell Fushi!

234
00:17:57,083 --> 00:18:00,750
I got it! Let's make immortal alcohol!

235
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:02,958
We'll dice up his fingers
and drop them in!

236
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:06,042
What are you saying, Grandpa Beer?
Cut that out!

237
00:18:07,167 --> 00:18:11,250
What are you getting all flustered for?
It's just a joke, my boy!

238
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:16,042
Well, I guess we'll just have to settle
for having him do street performances.

239
00:18:16,042 --> 00:18:17,667
That sounds good.

240
00:18:18,625 --> 00:18:21,208
Why are both of you so greedy?

241
00:18:21,208 --> 00:18:24,542
It's barbaric to use him to make money!

242
00:18:24,542 --> 00:18:28,375
Listen! 
Fushi holds a priceless and unique power!

243
00:18:28,375 --> 00:18:32,458
We should be thankful
we even had the chance to meet him!

244
00:18:32,458 --> 00:18:36,167
I want to welcome Fushi as family!

245
00:18:37,458 --> 00:18:38,417
That's right.

246
00:18:38,417 --> 00:18:40,125
Fushi is like a sibling to me.

247
00:18:40,125 --> 00:18:42,000
A big brother?

248
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,792
A little brother!

249
00:18:43,792 --> 00:18:46,125
Tasty. Tasty.

250
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,042
Hey, what do you think
you'll be in 10 years, Fushi?

251
00:18:53,042 --> 00:18:55,417
Meaning... Don't understand.

252
00:18:55,417 --> 00:18:59,833
I expect this'll be my life then as well.

253
00:18:59,833 --> 00:19:02,792
Cleaning. Cooking. Work.

254
00:19:02,792 --> 00:19:04,833
Living a boring life.

255
00:19:04,833 --> 00:19:07,167
Before I became like this,

256
00:19:07,167 --> 00:19:12,958
I dreamed of living in a grand mansion,
and dining on the fruits of the mountains.

257
00:19:12,958 --> 00:19:16,208
And now that dream has come true.

258
00:19:16,208 --> 00:19:19,833
But... There was a price for that.

259
00:19:19,833 --> 00:19:22,042
The me that had a cool brother...

260
00:19:22,042 --> 00:19:25,417
and a girl he wanted to talk to...

261
00:19:25,417 --> 00:19:30,542
That life that was only mine 
will never come back... Never.

262
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:34,792
This is an absolute and definite future.

263
00:19:34,792 --> 00:19:36,125
It...

264
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:38,500
-hurts me to think of it.
-Tasty...

265
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:41,292
But now that you're here, Fushi,

266
00:19:41,292 --> 00:19:44,375
I might be able
to come to terms with this boring life.

267
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:53,875
If you transformed into Grandpa Beer,
would you think alcohol is tasty?

268
00:19:53,875 --> 00:19:55,500
I don't know.

269
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,875
Try it out!

270
00:19:57,875 --> 00:19:59,250
How?

271
00:20:00,042 --> 00:20:01,250
Excuse me.

272
00:20:02,208 --> 00:20:04,333
Hello! Welcome!

273
00:20:08,167 --> 00:20:10,792
What... What would you like?

274
00:20:10,792 --> 00:20:12,750
This is a liquor store.

275
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:18,042
Um... It's not like I want alcohol!

276
00:20:18,042 --> 00:20:20,458
I'm looking for something good for the body!

277
00:20:20,458 --> 00:20:24,583
A liquor with nutritional supplements...

278
00:20:24,583 --> 00:20:25,458
Oh, I know!

279
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:28,833
What about some non-alcoholic pickles?

280
00:20:28,833 --> 00:20:32,333
Add some water and citrus, and it's amazing!

281
00:20:32,333 --> 00:20:33,458
That sounds great!

282
00:20:33,458 --> 00:20:35,708
Will it help heal wounds?

283
00:20:35,708 --> 00:20:37,542
Wounds?

284
00:20:37,542 --> 00:20:41,875
A wound from three months ago
that still hasn't healed...

285
00:20:41,875 --> 00:20:45,875
It's so large and embarrassing
that it can only be hidden...

286
00:20:46,417 --> 00:20:49,750
It... It'll heal the wound! Definitely!

287
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:50,750
Okay!

288
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:53,042
She's so cute!

289
00:20:53,042 --> 00:20:55,750
I'm glad this shop is so friendly.

290
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:59,042
I thought it was going to be scary.

291
00:20:59,042 --> 00:21:02,792
Like, that mask! What's with that?

292
00:21:05,083 --> 00:21:07,833
-Ugly...
-It's just a trick to attract customers!

293
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:10,125
Customers love it!

294
00:21:10,125 --> 00:21:11,708
I see.

295
00:21:14,542 --> 00:21:16,792
Oh, no. I'm so happy!

296
00:21:16,792 --> 00:21:20,333
Be careful! Don't forget your position!

297
00:21:20,333 --> 00:21:24,042
Um, you're not from this house, are you?

298
00:21:24,042 --> 00:21:26,375
That's right. I'm just working here.

299
00:21:26,375 --> 00:21:29,958
I see. So whenever I come here,
you'll still be here?

300
00:21:29,958 --> 00:21:34,125
Yes! In the fields in the morning,
and here in the shop during the afternoon!

301
00:21:34,125 --> 00:21:37,917
Can I... ask for your name?

302
00:21:37,917 --> 00:21:41,083
I... I'm...

303
00:21:41,083 --> 00:21:42,500
Gugu!

304
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,042
Not you.

305
00:21:44,042 --> 00:21:45,708
Him!

306
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:48,833
Fushi.

307
00:21:49,833 --> 00:21:51,875
Mr. Fushi!

308
00:21:51,875 --> 00:21:53,333
You're so handsome!

309
00:21:53,333 --> 00:21:55,333
How old are you? Where are you from?

310
00:21:55,333 --> 00:21:56,875
What do you like to eat?

311
00:21:56,875 --> 00:22:00,250
He likes all of my cooking!

312
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:01,708
Fruits.

313
00:22:01,708 --> 00:22:02,958
I see!

314
00:22:02,958 --> 00:22:05,250
-I love fruits too.
-Fushi! You're in the middle of work!

315
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:06,917
Call me Rynn.

316
00:22:06,917 --> 00:22:08,542
Rynn.

317
00:22:08,542 --> 00:22:10,083
Oh, you're so good!

318
00:22:10,083 --> 00:22:12,833
-Rynn. Rynn.
-Oh, stop it!

319
00:22:12,833 --> 00:22:16,000
All right. Go help Grandpa Beer!

320
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,208
So you won't annoy the customers!

321
00:22:18,208 --> 00:22:21,833
Aw, I wanted to go on a stroll with Mr. Fushi!

322
00:22:21,833 --> 00:22:24,833
That won't bother anyone, would it,
Mr. Shop Attendant?

323
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:30,333
No! Look, this man isn't even capable
of taking off his own clothes!

324
00:22:30,333 --> 00:22:32,958
As you can see, he isn't capable 
of speech yet either! Like a baby!

325
00:22:32,958 --> 00:22:37,833
He needs education! 
He has no time to play around!

326
00:22:37,833 --> 00:22:41,208
I could teach him how to speak.

327
00:22:41,208 --> 00:22:43,792
And how to take off his clothes too.

328
00:22:43,792 --> 00:22:45,125
Just kidding!

329
00:22:53,792 --> 00:22:57,292
Man cannot live on alcohol alone.

330
00:22:59,625 --> 00:23:03,958
One can drink alcohol
and thus enjoy the passage of time,

331
00:23:03,958 --> 00:23:07,917
but it will be insufficient 
to maintain his lifestyle.

332
00:23:07,917 --> 00:23:09,042
What are you saying?

333
00:23:09,042 --> 00:23:11,250
I don't even drink!

334
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:14,667
The time you spend despondent,

335
00:23:14,667 --> 00:23:20,375
is vital to molding yourself
into a profound human being.

336
00:23:21,458 --> 00:23:25,250
Feel pain and become a proper man,

337
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:26,833
Gugu.

338
00:23:44,625 --> 00:23:47,083
What are you doing?

339
00:23:47,083 --> 00:23:49,250
Training.

340
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:52,125
I'm giving myself worth!

341
00:23:52,125 --> 00:23:54,000
I will... also give.

342
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,208
You don't need to! Get down!

343
00:23:57,208 --> 00:24:00,708
Go back to your room and sleep.

344
00:24:06,542 --> 00:24:08,792
Isn't that Gugu?

345
00:24:08,792 --> 00:24:10,583
He's training.

346
00:24:10,583 --> 00:24:13,250
That's a real man.

347
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:15,208
Become a strong man, Gugu.

348
00:24:31,792 --> 00:24:35,542
Peaceful days in Takunaha allowed Gugu and Fushi

349
00:24:35,542 --> 00:24:41,500
to gradually deepen 
their understanding of each other.

350
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:48,375
However, 
when Gugu discovers a secret inside his body,

351
00:24:48,375 --> 00:24:50,125
he despairs.

352
00:24:50,125 --> 00:24:50,917
And reflects on his fate alone.

353
00:24:50,917 --> 00:24:54,875
"EPISODE EIGHT: MONSTER BROTHERS"
And reflects on his fate alone.
