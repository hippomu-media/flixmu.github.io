1
00:00:01,750 --> 00:00:04,667
From Ninannah to Yanome.

2
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:09,583
During the journey
and upon arriving at their destination,

3
00:00:09,583 --> 00:00:14,083
Fushi received countless "stimulation"

4
00:00:14,083 --> 00:00:20,917
and received
its first lesson on "consciousness".

5
00:00:22,375 --> 00:00:29,292
Fushi, who had been imprisoned
together with March, Parona, and Pioran,

6
00:00:29,292 --> 00:00:31,625
gained "consciousness".

7
00:00:31,625 --> 00:00:36,208
It changed forms and acted out.

8
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:43,792
After that, Fushi received another "impetus".

9
00:00:46,083 --> 00:00:53,625
What will all of this
accumulated information mean for Fushi?

10
00:02:22,583 --> 00:02:24,917
TO YOUR ETERNITY

11
00:02:36,292 --> 00:02:38,750
Come, March. Let's go home!

12
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:42,750
EPISODE FIVE
THOSE WHO ACCOMPANY YOU

13
00:02:49,292 --> 00:02:50,583
You too, Grandma.

14
00:02:55,833 --> 00:02:58,208
We're bringing Grandma back with us to Ninannah.

15
00:03:04,542 --> 00:03:06,917
Goodbye, Mr. Bear.

16
00:03:11,417 --> 00:03:14,875
We can get to the wagon room
through this waterway.

17
00:03:15,583 --> 00:03:19,167
Grandma, go on ahead with March.

18
00:03:19,167 --> 00:03:20,833
Here's the key.

19
00:03:22,583 --> 00:03:24,042
What about you, big sister?

20
00:03:24,042 --> 00:03:26,458
She still has work to do. Let's go.

21
00:03:47,708 --> 00:03:49,083
Stop!

22
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
What are you doing, big sister? Stop it!

23
00:03:55,708 --> 00:03:58,750
I'm only going to cut off a little bit.

24
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:03,500
I need to prove to the village that
the Spirit Bear is dead by showing them this.

25
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,542
That there is no need
for the ritual to be carried out any longer.

26
00:04:05,542 --> 00:04:08,000
But that's horrible!

27
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,583
Horrible?

28
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:13,542
March, it's dead.

29
00:04:13,542 --> 00:04:16,375
Horrible or not, it's only going
to be burned and turned to ashes now.

30
00:04:16,375 --> 00:04:18,417
But I feel sorry for him!

31
00:04:20,083 --> 00:04:21,167
I know.

32
00:04:27,792 --> 00:04:31,083
March, let's play a game.

33
00:04:31,083 --> 00:04:34,083
Go on ahead with Grandma now,

34
00:04:34,083 --> 00:04:36,958
and if you do, I'll give you a reward.

35
00:04:36,958 --> 00:04:38,125
Look!

36
00:04:38,125 --> 00:04:40,625
A fluffy dog!

37
00:04:46,125 --> 00:04:48,208
March, please,

38
00:04:48,208 --> 00:04:51,000
just this once, do as I say...

39
00:04:54,333 --> 00:04:57,167
If I can prove that the Spirit Bear is dead,

40
00:04:57,167 --> 00:05:00,167
then it's possible that we can avoid

41
00:05:00,167 --> 00:05:04,250
any children
being sacrificed like you almost were.

42
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:07,833
But it isn't the Spirit Bear...

43
00:05:07,833 --> 00:05:10,750
Then think of it this way.

44
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:16,208
This bear died to protect the poor children
like you from being sacrificed.

45
00:05:16,208 --> 00:05:20,250
It died to prevent the ritual
from ever happening again.

46
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:21,875
That's selfish!

47
00:05:21,875 --> 00:05:24,833
It's just a big and scary bear!

48
00:05:24,833 --> 00:05:27,167
It's not related to this!

49
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:31,500
No, March...
You're still a child. You wouldn't understand...

50
00:05:35,833 --> 00:05:38,208
Don't make that face, March...

51
00:05:38,208 --> 00:05:40,708
Big sister, why are you still laughing?

52
00:05:41,958 --> 00:05:43,917
I... I'm only trying to...

53
00:05:50,458 --> 00:05:52,667
Understood, March.

54
00:05:52,667 --> 00:05:54,167
I'll stop.

55
00:05:55,958 --> 00:05:57,292
Let's go.

56
00:06:07,917 --> 00:06:11,000
How do you plan to persuade the villagers?

57
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,875
I don't think it'll go well...

58
00:06:15,167 --> 00:06:16,875
I'll do it.

59
00:06:16,875 --> 00:06:21,625
Without using others' lives,
I'll prove that I can do it.

60
00:06:37,833 --> 00:06:40,833
Hooray! We made it out!

61
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:43,750
We'll cut straight across the city!

62
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:46,583
We're going back to Ninannah.

63
00:06:46,583 --> 00:06:50,208
I'm so happy to be able to see my parents again!

64
00:06:50,208 --> 00:06:54,792
Will everyone be happy
if they find out March is still alive?

65
00:06:54,792 --> 00:06:56,958
Of course, March!

66
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:04,583
You're a terrible driver.

67
00:07:04,583 --> 00:07:06,458
Should I drive instead?

68
00:07:11,542 --> 00:07:14,542
Oh, these are the presents to give thanks.

69
00:07:14,542 --> 00:07:17,125
I want to give them to big sister later.

70
00:07:17,125 --> 00:07:18,917
So keep it a secret for me.

71
00:07:18,917 --> 00:07:20,750
What's a secret?

72
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,167
Oh, nothing!

73
00:07:23,167 --> 00:07:24,542
Is that so?

74
00:07:27,667 --> 00:07:31,208
Hey March,
what will you do once you've grown up?

75
00:07:31,208 --> 00:07:36,167
March will do everything that she can do!

76
00:07:36,167 --> 00:07:37,458
First, March has to learn how to cook,

77
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:40,208
or else she can't be a mother.

78
00:07:40,208 --> 00:07:42,333
Then one day, when she has kids,

79
00:07:42,333 --> 00:07:46,208
she wants to make dolls
for them like big sister does.

80
00:07:46,208 --> 00:07:48,417
Also, March wants to learn more words.

81
00:07:48,417 --> 00:07:50,792
And maybe even how to write.

82
00:07:50,792 --> 00:07:53,917
Maybe create a script for Ninannah...

83
00:07:53,917 --> 00:07:57,583
Either way,
March wants to know everything she doesn't know.

84
00:07:57,583 --> 00:08:01,667
Growing up means learning
and knowing more and more things, right?

85
00:08:01,667 --> 00:08:04,375
Of course, Fushi will be with me.

86
00:08:04,375 --> 00:08:08,208
We'll learn together and grow up together.

87
00:08:08,208 --> 00:08:11,375
That wish will definitely come true, March.

88
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:16,167
Big sister!

89
00:08:16,708 --> 00:08:17,750
It's all right.

90
00:08:25,208 --> 00:08:27,083
This is a game as well.

91
00:08:27,083 --> 00:08:30,167
A game of escaping before we're caught.

92
00:08:36,542 --> 00:08:38,417
Hand over the dog.

93
00:08:38,417 --> 00:08:41,250
If you do so, I will spare your lives.

94
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:43,000
-No!
-I refuse.

95
00:08:50,083 --> 00:08:52,250
Come at me! I'll knock you down!

96
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:54,375
No, big sister! It's too dangerous!

97
00:08:54,375 --> 00:08:56,000
You'll get killed!

98
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,750
What is it? Did something happen?

99
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:00,875
Please keep the wagon running!

100
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:04,542
Stand back, March!

101
00:09:04,542 --> 00:09:06,667
Big sister, don't go!

102
00:09:08,583 --> 00:09:10,958
What should March do?

103
00:09:12,125 --> 00:09:13,792
What should I do?

104
00:09:27,917 --> 00:09:29,625
March wants to...

105
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,583
That's right. Come.

106
00:09:51,583 --> 00:09:52,542
Dog.

107
00:10:04,417 --> 00:10:08,333
Mom, I'm so hungry I think I'm going to die...

108
00:10:08,333 --> 00:10:10,042
Oh, don't worry.

109
00:10:10,042 --> 00:10:12,583
Mom will make food for you.

110
00:10:12,583 --> 00:10:14,667
Making food!

111
00:10:14,667 --> 00:10:18,083
It's so good! Mom, your cooking is the best!

112
00:10:18,833 --> 00:10:20,417
Oh, you poor thing.

113
00:10:20,417 --> 00:10:23,083
Mom will make food for you right away.

114
00:10:23,083 --> 00:10:25,042
Making food.

115
00:10:25,542 --> 00:10:27,167
Oh, you poor thing.

116
00:10:27,167 --> 00:10:30,958
Dad will be coming home early today,
so I made a lot of food.

117
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:33,125
Making food.

118
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:37,583
Hey, why are you always alone?

119
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:43,250
Well... I don't have any family.

120
00:10:46,125 --> 00:10:48,708
Oh, right...

121
00:10:48,708 --> 00:10:49,958
For you.

122
00:10:55,292 --> 00:10:57,167
Wait up a bit!

123
00:10:57,167 --> 00:11:00,125
Here! Some food as thanks!

124
00:11:01,375 --> 00:11:02,792
Thank you...

125
00:11:04,458 --> 00:11:07,375
Chomp. Chomp.

126
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:08,750
Wow, it's so tasty!

127
00:11:11,667 --> 00:11:14,208
Can't we be a family?

128
00:11:15,333 --> 00:11:18,167
See, this is our child.

129
00:11:18,167 --> 00:11:22,083
March will be the mom, and you can be the dad.

130
00:11:23,917 --> 00:11:32,250
March... March! March!

131
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:33,417
March!

132
00:11:34,208 --> 00:11:35,625
March!

133
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:40,375
Big sister...

134
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:44,292
It'll be all right.

135
00:11:44,292 --> 00:11:45,875
It'll be all right, March!

136
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:49,708
I'll fix you up right now!

137
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,833
Is March going to die for sister's sake?

138
00:11:59,042 --> 00:12:00,667
No, March...

139
00:12:00,667 --> 00:12:03,500
You're going to go back
to the village and become an adult!

140
00:12:10,208 --> 00:12:12,083
This...

141
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:18,583
For big sister... As a thank you...

142
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:24,250
Big sister...

143
00:12:27,458 --> 00:12:33,208
Become a mother... in March's place.

144
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:41,833
No, March! Isn't that your dream?

145
00:12:41,833 --> 00:12:43,875
You need to become a mom!

146
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:46,500
Isn't that right, March?

147
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:47,875
Right?

148
00:12:52,042 --> 00:12:53,625
Look, it's finished!

149
00:12:53,625 --> 00:12:55,542
Now, you'll be fine!

150
00:12:55,542 --> 00:12:57,708
All that's left to do is to go back!

151
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:04,125
Big... sister...

152
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:10,458
Is Fushi... here?

153
00:13:15,083 --> 00:13:16,542
Yes.

154
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:27,875
That's... good...

155
00:14:01,083 --> 00:14:02,625
Wow, this looks good.

156
00:14:06,667 --> 00:14:10,208
Your cooking really is the best after all.

157
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:43,500
Release the arrows!

158
00:14:47,083 --> 00:14:48,583
What's going on?

159
00:14:51,375 --> 00:14:54,583
-It's the Spirit Bear!
-The Spirit Bear has been angered!

160
00:14:54,583 --> 00:14:56,167
Release the arrows!

161
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:03,625
Fushi.

162
00:15:07,167 --> 00:15:08,833
Thank you.

163
00:15:08,833 --> 00:15:12,125
You're fighting for March's sake, aren't you?

164
00:15:12,125 --> 00:15:16,542
But it's all right now.
You needn't fight anymore.

165
00:15:49,958 --> 00:15:54,750
March, I'm sorry for always
coming home late because of work.

166
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:57,792
But today,

167
00:15:57,792 --> 00:16:00,583
it seems like my work will be finished early.

168
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:07,208
Let's go back together now.

169
00:16:20,375 --> 00:16:21,375
March?

170
00:16:21,375 --> 00:16:22,875
Is that you, March?

171
00:16:23,708 --> 00:16:25,375
Yes, it's me!

172
00:16:25,375 --> 00:16:28,500
Aren't you surprised that March is still alive?

173
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,542
It was so hard!

174
00:16:30,542 --> 00:16:33,375
-That's great, March!
-There, there.

175
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:36,792
Mom, we're so hungry
we feel like we're going to die!

176
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:42,208
Oh, don't worry.

177
00:16:42,792 --> 00:16:45,875
Mom will make food for all of you!

178
00:16:47,458 --> 00:16:49,000
Hmm, how many are there?

179
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,708
One, two, three, four...

180
00:16:54,583 --> 00:16:56,000
Hmm? Fushi?

181
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:05,375
Where am I?

182
00:17:14,875 --> 00:17:18,458
That's right... I'm...

183
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,208
Let's go back together now.

184
00:17:45,208 --> 00:17:47,042
Big sister.

185
00:17:47,042 --> 00:17:48,625
Fushi.

186
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,083
Big sister!

187
00:17:54,083 --> 00:17:57,292
March is here! Right here!

188
00:18:05,958 --> 00:18:08,917
No, no, no! March doesn't want to die!

189
00:18:08,917 --> 00:18:11,583
March is here! March isn't dead!

190
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:14,042
There are so many things March wants to do!

191
00:18:14,042 --> 00:18:17,125
And she hasn't done any of them yet!

192
00:18:17,125 --> 00:18:20,417
It's all right, March.

193
00:18:22,667 --> 00:18:26,667
Wait for me. I'll be there soon.

194
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:33,333
I'm not equipped to accept this reality...

195
00:18:33,333 --> 00:18:35,875
and continue to live on carefree.

196
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,250
No, big sister!

197
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:41,792
You can't! Don't die!

198
00:18:41,792 --> 00:18:44,000
Fushi, stop her!

199
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,958
Help big sister!

200
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:49,917
Stop!

201
00:19:05,208 --> 00:19:06,292
Over there!

202
00:19:06,292 --> 00:19:08,708
Capture it while it's still in human form!

203
00:19:23,208 --> 00:19:26,917
And yet you tell me to keep on living.

204
00:19:26,917 --> 00:19:28,833
What a distasteful guy...

205
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:09,875
Parona!

206
00:20:13,042 --> 00:20:14,583
That's...

207
00:20:14,583 --> 00:20:16,917
It can't be... The Spirit Bear!

208
00:20:21,667 --> 00:20:25,250
Parona! Everyone was looking for you!

209
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:29,458
Where have you been for the past half-year?

210
00:20:32,375 --> 00:20:34,833
I...

211
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:37,333
couldn't do anything.

212
00:20:40,042 --> 00:20:43,000
That's right... This is for you.

213
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:46,250
I was entrusted to give this letter to you.

214
00:20:47,542 --> 00:20:49,333
A "letter"?

215
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:51,542
It's a paper with words written on it.

216
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:58,250
Isn't this... just a hand print?

217
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:00,792
What's written there is...

218
00:21:00,792 --> 00:21:02,917
"March is doing well".

219
00:21:20,125 --> 00:21:22,333
What have I done?

220
00:21:22,333 --> 00:21:24,958
As her parent,

221
00:21:24,958 --> 00:21:27,625
I should've protected her...

222
00:21:29,833 --> 00:21:33,708
I'm... so sorry!

223
00:21:38,917 --> 00:21:42,958
Thank you for fighting for March...

224
00:22:09,792 --> 00:22:11,292
The Yanome are here!

225
00:22:11,292 --> 00:22:13,917
The Yanome? Why are they here?

226
00:22:16,167 --> 00:22:18,458
They must be after you.

227
00:22:18,458 --> 00:22:19,958
You have to run, Fushi.

228
00:22:19,958 --> 00:22:22,083
Avoid their scent and escape.

229
00:22:22,083 --> 00:22:24,833
There is nobody to give your life meaning!

230
00:22:24,833 --> 00:22:26,750
You must grasp it yourself!

231
00:22:28,125 --> 00:22:31,500
You understand my words, right?

232
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:07,458
-Where are they?
-Over there.

233
00:23:12,125 --> 00:23:13,750
They're close.

234
00:23:15,042 --> 00:23:16,917
Have they caught sight of Fushi?

235
00:23:16,917 --> 00:23:18,875
I have to stop them.

236
00:23:29,375 --> 00:23:32,208
There's only this heavy, strong one.

237
00:23:32,208 --> 00:23:33,792
That's fine.

238
00:23:56,958 --> 00:23:58,292
It hit!

239
00:23:58,292 --> 00:23:59,708
No.

240
00:24:01,083 --> 00:24:02,542
I missed...

241
00:24:03,208 --> 00:24:04,875
I missed!

242
00:24:10,875 --> 00:24:16,167
Having met and separated from its mother,

243
00:24:16,167 --> 00:24:18,458
"It" gained a sense of humanity.

244
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,292
No.

245
00:24:21,292 --> 00:24:24,042
They never separated.

246
00:24:24,042 --> 00:24:26,958
They traveled on together.

247
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,417
Fushi reunited with Pioran

248
00:24:34,417 --> 00:24:38,917
and began to learn the language
and ways of living as a human

249
00:24:38,917 --> 00:24:41,417
as he carried on his journey.

250
00:24:41,417 --> 00:24:46,917
Suddenly, it was attacked by an unknown matter.

251
00:24:46,917 --> 00:24:51,792
A being that could threaten its existence.

252
00:24:51,792 --> 00:24:54,917
"EPISODE SIX: OUR OBJECTIVE"
A battle is about to begin.
