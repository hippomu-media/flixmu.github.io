1
00:00:03,125 --> 00:00:06,375
The escape from the prison of Yanome

2
00:00:08,375 --> 00:00:12,250
resulted in an unexpected fatality,

3
00:00:15,958 --> 00:00:18,125
March's death.

4
00:00:18,917 --> 00:00:24,208
The second human to have died before Fushi.

5
00:00:25,917 --> 00:00:29,625
Thus, "It" received a new stimulus.

6
00:00:33,042 --> 00:00:36,917
Fushi, who had gained a sense of humanity

7
00:00:37,875 --> 00:00:41,625
after its fateful encounter
with its mother, March,

8
00:00:43,875 --> 00:00:46,917
chases after her lingering traces

9
00:00:47,542 --> 00:00:49,667
and continues on its journey.

10
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:23,000
TO YOUR ETERNITY

11
00:02:27,042 --> 00:02:32,042
And so it continued walking,
in search of the next stimulus.

12
00:02:32,833 --> 00:02:37,375
It spent most of its time as a wolf,

13
00:02:37,375 --> 00:02:41,542
likely to the end
of sniffing out its destination.

14
00:02:43,833 --> 00:02:46,542
It did not take the form of a bear,

15
00:02:46,542 --> 00:02:49,667
likely because of how much it would pain him.

16
00:02:52,292 --> 00:02:54,583
It occasionally took the form of a boy,

17
00:02:55,333 --> 00:02:57,333
to no significant end.

18
00:03:03,708 --> 00:03:07,833
When it hungered, it took the form of March,

19
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:14,417
likely because it could thus
best obtain the trees' fruits.

20
00:03:21,208 --> 00:03:22,708
And finally,

21
00:03:23,375 --> 00:03:26,958
it reached a familiar scent.

22
00:03:26,958 --> 00:03:30,917
EPISODE SIX
OUR OBJECTIVE

23
00:03:43,542 --> 00:03:46,208
Oh, so you were alive, after all!

24
00:03:46,208 --> 00:03:48,542
It was dreadful!

25
00:03:48,542 --> 00:03:54,583
I was looking for you
for three days and three nights,
and I had to beg for food,

26
00:03:54,583 --> 00:03:57,667
and then the donkey ran away
when I was going to give it some water,

27
00:03:57,667 --> 00:04:00,458
so I ended up stranded here,
staving off the wind and rain...

28
00:04:01,667 --> 00:04:05,208
Oh? Wasn't that Parona girl with you?

29
00:04:05,208 --> 00:04:07,792
And that monster, "Fushi"...

30
00:04:08,708 --> 00:04:11,125
Hey, aren't you going to say something?

31
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:22,833
Oh, it's you.

32
00:04:22,833 --> 00:04:25,500
That's why you didn't say anything.

33
00:04:29,708 --> 00:04:34,458
Well, you're the only one around now...

34
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:38,250
Where are you going?

35
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:45,250
Hey, you can't leave an elderly woman alone!

36
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:53,917
Though I can't understand at all
what goes through your head...

37
00:04:53,917 --> 00:04:58,208
When do you take March's form?
What do you think of them?

38
00:04:58,208 --> 00:05:04,583
Does a monster such as you
have feelings or emotions?

39
00:05:04,583 --> 00:05:09,458
Although I can see that
you don't seem to know how to express them.

40
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:17,833
I'd like to look into your heart sometime...

41
00:05:19,042 --> 00:05:21,458
I'm hungry...

42
00:05:21,458 --> 00:05:24,875
I haven't eaten since two days ago...

43
00:05:26,083 --> 00:05:28,458
Should we stop and rest?

44
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:37,917
Water... meat...

45
00:05:47,208 --> 00:05:49,417
Thigh meat!

46
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:00,458
Eh? Why not?

47
00:06:00,458 --> 00:06:02,458
You're not losing anything!
Let me cook and eat you!

48
00:06:02,458 --> 00:06:05,542
Treasure your elders!

49
00:06:06,875 --> 00:06:08,292
Come here...

50
00:06:28,083 --> 00:06:29,542
You devil!

51
00:06:34,417 --> 00:06:37,083
Please, give me some too!

52
00:06:37,083 --> 00:06:39,458
I won't bite you anymore! Please!

53
00:06:53,542 --> 00:06:54,875
Ah, it's good!

54
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:05,000
It's good...

55
00:07:07,375 --> 00:07:08,333
It's good!

56
00:07:11,958 --> 00:07:13,083
It's good...

57
00:07:13,083 --> 00:07:16,083
It's good...

58
00:07:21,667 --> 00:07:24,708
Thank you.

59
00:07:30,833 --> 00:07:35,042
Thank you, thank you! Good girl!

60
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:41,708
Oh, a map.

61
00:07:42,667 --> 00:07:45,625
Oh, there's a village nearby!

62
00:07:45,625 --> 00:07:49,750
Though it's about a hundred Ri away.

63
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:52,792
We'll probably reach the sea by then.

64
00:07:59,958 --> 00:08:01,750
How about it, Fushi?

65
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:05,333
My hometown is just beyond the ocean.

66
00:08:05,333 --> 00:08:06,750
Should we go visit?

67
00:08:21,583 --> 00:08:23,083
What?

68
00:08:31,958 --> 00:08:35,083
Oh, you're interested in the script.

69
00:08:42,042 --> 00:08:46,458
Look. This is how you write "Ri".

70
00:08:53,917 --> 00:08:55,250
That's right.

71
00:09:08,167 --> 00:09:10,542
Do you want to know more?

72
00:09:10,542 --> 00:09:12,500
Then follow me.

73
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:18,625
I will teach you language,
script, and how to live as a human.

74
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:20,875
But you'll have to take care of me.

75
00:09:27,125 --> 00:09:30,583
This is "March".

76
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:37,792
No, that's not it. Here.

77
00:09:37,792 --> 00:09:41,167
This is "Fushi". Your name.

78
00:09:41,167 --> 00:09:43,500
"Parona".

79
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,625
This is my name,

80
00:09:45,625 --> 00:09:48,042
"Pioran".

81
00:09:49,583 --> 00:09:52,458
That is a "tree".

82
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:57,375
That is a "flower".

83
00:09:57,375 --> 00:09:58,708
"Bird".

84
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:01,125
"Sun".

85
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:07,375
Tasty!

86
00:10:18,875 --> 00:10:21,083
"River".

87
00:10:21,083 --> 00:10:22,875
River.

88
00:10:25,917 --> 00:10:29,000
"Fish". "Fire".

89
00:10:30,667 --> 00:10:34,208
Fish. Fire.

90
00:10:38,417 --> 00:10:42,083
Thank you. Thank you.

91
00:10:42,083 --> 00:10:46,167
You're not wrong,
but there's a more appropriate phasing.

92
00:10:48,875 --> 00:10:50,375
"Tasty!"

93
00:10:56,042 --> 00:10:57,250
Tasty!

94
00:10:58,375 --> 00:11:00,375
Tasty. Tasty.

95
00:11:01,458 --> 00:11:02,500
Goodnight.

96
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:04,792
Goodnight.

97
00:11:38,083 --> 00:11:40,333
What's that?

98
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:42,000
A "boat".

99
00:11:43,542 --> 00:11:45,500
"Fish".

100
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,750
"Fruit".

101
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:49,875
That's right.

102
00:11:54,417 --> 00:11:59,625
Well, you've become
quite capable of speaking.

103
00:11:59,625 --> 00:12:01,125
"Become".

104
00:12:01,125 --> 00:12:05,208
Is this change thanks to March?

105
00:12:05,208 --> 00:12:10,042
I will grow up... and learn things.

106
00:12:10,042 --> 00:12:14,292
Oh, so you want to grow up?

107
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:18,458
Hey, before you met March,

108
00:12:18,458 --> 00:12:21,000
what were you doing?

109
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,667
Who were you with?

110
00:12:24,417 --> 00:12:28,750
I was always walking, alone.

111
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:32,042
Then I met him.

112
00:12:32,042 --> 00:12:35,333
He gave me food.

113
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:38,708
Who? Who did you meet?

114
00:12:38,708 --> 00:12:40,792
I don't... know.

115
00:12:40,792 --> 00:12:43,792
Don't know his name.

116
00:12:43,792 --> 00:12:49,958
Form. Voice. Smell. I remember.

117
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:54,208
I... became him.

118
00:12:54,208 --> 00:12:55,583
The end.

119
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:06,250
Land is in sight.

120
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:13,875
Look, over there, where the sky is red.

121
00:13:13,875 --> 00:13:17,417
Every day, the Yanome
fight like that with the Takunaha,

122
00:13:17,417 --> 00:13:20,208
which is where we're going.

123
00:13:24,042 --> 00:13:27,792
My lover's house is up ahead,

124
00:13:27,792 --> 00:13:30,292
so for now, let's go there.

125
00:13:30,292 --> 00:13:32,708
We'll sleep in the forest for tonight.

126
00:13:34,542 --> 00:13:37,000
He's very knowledgeable,

127
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,625
so he might know a thing or two about you.

128
00:13:41,583 --> 00:13:44,042
We'll probably arrive tomorrow.

129
00:14:00,125 --> 00:14:05,458
What's this? 
Someone has come to play in my garden.

130
00:14:29,292 --> 00:14:32,625
Its body now responds differently.

131
00:14:32,625 --> 00:14:36,708
It refuses to regenerate into the boy's form.

132
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,875
What's wrong, Fushi?

133
00:14:42,875 --> 00:14:44,750
What happened?

134
00:15:13,917 --> 00:15:15,458
What are you?

135
00:15:15,458 --> 00:15:17,667
Taking on Fushi's appearance,

136
00:15:17,667 --> 00:15:19,625
what the heck do you...

137
00:15:43,125 --> 00:15:47,792
Even if you fail to act,
it will surely hear your voices.

138
00:15:47,792 --> 00:15:52,375
How does it feel to have 
lost a part of yourself?

139
00:15:53,167 --> 00:15:56,000
You were stolen by that.

140
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:01,583
That boy, his form, his sound, his smell.

141
00:16:03,167 --> 00:16:08,417
And so long as that boy remains stolen from you,
you will likely be unable to ever remember what you've lost.

142
00:16:08,417 --> 00:16:10,875
Yet you should be aware of it,

143
00:16:10,875 --> 00:16:14,542
of an uncomfortable feeling
arising from that void.

144
00:16:14,542 --> 00:16:18,000
Is what stands there
something of worth to you?

145
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,167
I'll advise you in a way you can understand.

146
00:16:22,167 --> 00:16:24,750
That is your enemy.

147
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:27,583
Fight it, and defeat it.

148
00:16:48,792 --> 00:16:51,750
Inside it is a core.

149
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:54,292
Rip it out from its body.

150
00:16:54,292 --> 00:16:56,917
Then its movements will stop.

151
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:21,417
Not bad.

152
00:17:28,833 --> 00:17:32,583
-Fushi!
-Don't... come...

153
00:17:41,542 --> 00:17:45,167
It has been designed

154
00:17:45,167 --> 00:17:50,292
to weaken you
by stealing the vessels you gathered.

155
00:17:50,292 --> 00:17:53,208
It is an imperfection
that cannot be called a "living being".

156
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,417
But it is capable of theft.

157
00:18:39,583 --> 00:18:41,500
Well done.

158
00:18:42,167 --> 00:18:44,167
That is its core.

159
00:18:44,917 --> 00:18:48,542
Inside it resides 
that which was stolen from you.

160
00:18:57,208 --> 00:18:59,750
All that is left is to reclaim it.

161
00:21:22,625 --> 00:21:26,083
What... are you?

162
00:21:28,375 --> 00:21:31,667
I created you.

163
00:21:31,667 --> 00:21:35,833
We have a great goal.

164
00:21:35,833 --> 00:21:39,042
To preserve this world.

165
00:21:40,083 --> 00:21:46,833
And this is something
created to impede our progress.

166
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:51,000
You don't seem to understand.

167
00:21:55,125 --> 00:21:58,792
No matter. We shall speak again.

168
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:02,875
Now then, Fushi, let's have fun.

169
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:09,750
Until the end comes.

170
00:22:13,292 --> 00:22:15,625
Fushi, are you all right?

171
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:18,042
What was that thing just now?

172
00:22:22,375 --> 00:22:23,917
Fushi...

173
00:22:28,458 --> 00:22:30,292
Don't know.

174
00:22:30,292 --> 00:22:31,875
Was weird.

175
00:22:44,708 --> 00:22:46,750
Are you here, old man?

176
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:53,250
I brought you a great souvenir!

177
00:22:54,625 --> 00:22:57,750
An immortal monster!

178
00:24:31,333 --> 00:24:37,750
Fushi starts a new life in the home 
of an old man who sells alcohol.

179
00:24:39,417 --> 00:24:43,750
He was warmly welcomed
by the masked boy,

180
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:45,042
Gugu.

181
00:24:46,167 --> 00:24:49,042
Fushi's existence

182
00:24:49,042 --> 00:24:51,042
also seems

183
00:24:51,042 --> 00:24:54,917
"EPISODE SEVEN: THE BOY WHO WANTS TO CHANGE"
to have brought a new stimulus for Gugu.
