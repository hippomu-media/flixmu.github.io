1
00:00:08,344 --> 00:00:13,625
I, the Storm Dragon
Veldora Tempest, have returned!

2
00:00:14,223 --> 00:00:18,227
Anyone who opposes me will die!

3
00:00:22,203 --> 00:00:25,640
Hey, old man.
How did you know that line?

4
00:00:27,538 --> 00:00:32,913
I got bored so I analyzed your memory
and read this thing you call manga!

5
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,243
And also!

6
00:00:35,202 --> 00:00:37,871
My shogi skill is now equal to that of a Meijin.

7
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:41,583
And since I'm a dragon,
you can even say that I'm Ryuo level!

8
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:42,918
(Ryuo; Dragon King)

9
00:00:43,293 --> 00:00:47,898
I see, glad that you enjoyed
your time in my stomach.

10
00:00:50,172 --> 00:00:53,625
I just got revived,
aren't you being a bit too cold?

11
00:00:55,097 --> 00:00:58,211
But it was way faster than I expected.

12
00:00:58,602 --> 00:01:00,750
Let me thank you, Rimuru Tempest!

13
00:01:00,775 --> 00:01:02,609
My sworn friend!

14
00:01:04,664 --> 00:01:08,227
Sworn friend? That's old, man.

15
00:01:14,273 --> 00:01:17,851
That's right, did you
receive a Gift as well?

16
00:01:18,141 --> 00:01:19,969
Glad you asked!

17
00:01:19,994 --> 00:01:26,295
Thanks to you, my Unique Skill Inquirer
now became Ultimate skill Faust!

18
00:01:26,295 --> 00:01:29,609
This is the power that embodies
my restless pursuit of knowledge--

19
00:01:29,634 --> 00:01:31,250
As I thought.

20
00:01:31,275 --> 00:01:35,732
My Great Sage also evolved into
Ultimate Skill Raphael, after all.

21
00:01:35,757 --> 00:01:36,576
Yes.

22
00:01:36,601 --> 00:01:43,279
And by analyzing Veldora's residue,
you have obtained Ultimate Skill Veldora.

23
00:01:44,563 --> 00:01:45,397
Also,

24
00:01:45,397 --> 00:01:50,093
after using Unique Skill Unlimited Imprisonment
as a base for ability rearrangement,

25
00:01:50,118 --> 00:01:54,197
Ultimate Skill Uriel has
been successfully acquired.

26
00:01:54,197 --> 00:01:57,164
So now I have a total of four
Ultimate Skills?!

27
00:01:57,189 --> 00:01:58,774
Indeed you have.

28
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:04,249
So with that in mind,
I'm now invincible!

29
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:06,406
You can just relax and let me help you out!

30
00:02:06,431 --> 00:02:07,570
O-Okay...

31
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:37,366
Fate repeats all over again

32
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:39,785
The voices of my heart say

33
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:42,898
Time is not enough, it's over

34
00:02:44,046 --> 00:02:48,297
Belief that makes me who I am

35
00:02:48,423 --> 00:02:50,656
Light doesn't fade away

36
00:02:50,744 --> 00:02:53,632
Made my mind up now, it's better

37
00:02:55,344 --> 00:02:58,985
Yeah I know it's not an easy road

38
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:00,930
Lured by your hands

39
00:03:00,955 --> 00:03:04,492
Even if it rains don't be swayed

40
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:06,539
Being same as always

41
00:03:06,564 --> 00:03:09,227
Want to feel my destiny

42
00:03:09,252 --> 00:03:11,852
Open my eyes to be braver

43
00:03:11,877 --> 00:03:15,054
Get up now Get up now stronger

44
00:03:15,079 --> 00:03:17,461
I believe in myself

45
00:03:17,572 --> 00:03:20,648
Stand up now Stand up now shouting

46
00:03:20,922 --> 00:03:23,321
I'll never run away

47
00:03:23,346 --> 00:03:27,985
I might lose control

48
00:03:28,789 --> 00:03:34,164
It's a perfect world

49
00:03:34,649 --> 00:03:39,687
Destroy all of it,
in the end it's for our good

50
00:03:39,712 --> 00:03:42,867
Let me shout like flames

51
00:03:44,439 --> 00:03:48,423
(Episode 37: The Visitors)

52
00:03:51,022 --> 00:03:53,408
The outside world
after several hundred years.

53
00:03:54,713 --> 00:03:56,353
The air is delicious!

54
00:03:56,378 --> 00:03:59,767
Say, can you tone down
your enormous aura a little?

55
00:03:59,792 --> 00:04:01,955
You'll scare off those in the town.

56
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:03,952
Very well, I will try.

57
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:05,822
Imagine like piling it up inside.

58
00:04:06,288 --> 00:04:08,165
I see, I can do "that."

59
00:04:08,165 --> 00:04:09,300
"That"?

60
00:04:13,461 --> 00:04:15,755
He's releasing his aura like crazy...

61
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:24,836
How is it?

62
00:04:24,861 --> 00:04:26,422
Oh, looks good.

63
00:04:26,657 --> 00:04:28,883
Your aura is pretty small now.

64
00:04:32,481 --> 00:04:36,835
I learn this from the holy sculpture!
It contains all the world's knowledge!

65
00:04:36,877 --> 00:04:39,994
He must've tried something
he read from a manga.

66
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:49,831
Hey everyone! Sorry for the wait!

67
00:04:49,831 --> 00:04:53,681
Oh, Great Rimuru! Are you okay?
We were really worried!

68
00:04:53,714 --> 00:04:58,041
There was a sudden sign that
the Storm Dragon Veldora has been revived!

69
00:04:58,066 --> 00:05:00,383
I'm actually going to explain that now.

70
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:02,705
But before that,
let me introduce this guy to you.

71
00:05:08,855 --> 00:05:10,573
This guy is Veldora!

72
00:05:10,598 --> 00:05:13,386
He's a little shy guy,
but please get along with him!

73
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:23,437
Eh?

74
00:05:23,462 --> 00:05:26,735
Hey there! I'm not a shy guy in the slightest!

75
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:30,704
It's simply that there aren't many
people who could actually reach me alive!

76
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,313
Ms. Treyni!

77
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:38,880
Our guardian deity, Lord Veldora.

78
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,672
We congratulate you on your revival.

79
00:05:41,918 --> 00:05:44,761
Oh, Dryads, it's been a while.

80
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:47,639
You did well looking after my forest!

81
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:49,724
Your thanks are more than we deserve.

82
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:54,396
You've kindly taken us in after we got
separated from the spirit queen.

83
00:05:54,396 --> 00:05:57,440
It is a favor that cannot
be so easily repaid.

84
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,813
Don't mind it.

85
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:08,157
Eh?! He's the real Storm Dragon?!

86
00:06:08,182 --> 00:06:09,745
You got to be kidding me.

87
00:06:10,412 --> 00:06:12,664
I'll be counting on you to
help out Rimuru from now on.

88
00:06:12,664 --> 00:06:15,040
Because I will stay here with him as well.

89
00:06:15,065 --> 00:06:17,961
Hey, what do you mean by that?!

90
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:19,504
E-Excuse me...!

91
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:20,399
What is it?

92
00:06:20,424 --> 00:06:24,759
May we humbly ask what's your
relationship with Great Rimuru?

93
00:06:25,829 --> 00:06:26,977
You want to know?

94
00:06:27,002 --> 00:06:29,088
Indeed, if you kindly!

95
00:06:30,235 --> 00:06:31,509
Very well.

96
00:06:34,807 --> 00:06:38,273
Rimuru is my confidant,
another half of my soul,

97
00:06:38,273 --> 00:06:40,066
and a sworn friend!

98
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:41,680
Sworn friend!

99
00:06:41,821 --> 00:06:42,720
Sworn friend!

100
00:06:42,745 --> 00:06:45,485
Stop it! Now you're embarrassing me!

101
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:51,821
Amazing! So not only he's acquaintance
with Lady Milim but also Lord Veldora?!

102
00:06:53,814 --> 00:06:56,885
Great Rimuru has always been
amazing since the beginning!

103
00:06:56,910 --> 00:06:59,510
It's like anything goes at this point.

104
00:06:59,603 --> 00:07:01,611
It's only natural for My Lord!

105
00:07:01,636 --> 00:07:02,853
Indeed it is.

106
00:07:04,213 --> 00:07:07,346
Incidentally, what is that appearance,
Lord Veldora?

107
00:07:08,415 --> 00:07:10,977
This is a medium Rimuru made for me!

108
00:07:11,071 --> 00:07:12,751
What do you think? Cool, isn't it?

109
00:07:12,776 --> 00:07:14,758
Yes, it is very cool.

110
00:07:14,783 --> 00:07:17,102
You think so? You think so?!

111
00:07:20,315 --> 00:07:21,876
Now it all makes sense!

112
00:07:21,901 --> 00:07:26,696
When you first showed up in front of us,
it was right after Lord Veldora disappeared.

113
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:28,448
I kept it a secret.

114
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:32,321
I thought it would take over a hundred
years until I can release Veldora,

115
00:07:32,346 --> 00:07:36,414
and who knows what others
would do if they know about it.

116
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:37,610
Indeed.

117
00:07:39,649 --> 00:07:40,806
Great Rimuru!

118
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:44,673
We're already done with
the preparation for the banquet.

119
00:07:44,756 --> 00:07:45,938
Okay.

120
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:58,319
Everyone!

121
00:07:58,344 --> 00:08:02,163
A lot of things happened,
but let's all forget about it today

122
00:08:02,188 --> 00:08:04,859
and eat, drink, and have fun!

123
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:07,324
Let's celebrate the fact
that we are all alive right now!

124
00:08:21,988 --> 00:08:26,386
Everyone partied hard that night
like they're in a festival.

125
00:08:26,941 --> 00:08:30,175
We celebrated Veldora's revival
and reunion with those we once lost.

126
00:08:37,402 --> 00:08:39,182
I received a blow!

127
00:08:39,207 --> 00:08:43,909
Then I rotate my body and
deliver a punch from behind!

128
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:52,245
It's almost done!

129
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:03,220
Why am I here too?

130
00:09:03,245 --> 00:09:06,171
Please taste Shion's cooking
together with me.

131
00:09:06,461 --> 00:09:08,156
Don't get me involved!

132
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,962
It might miraculously tastes delicious!

133
00:09:11,478 --> 00:09:14,798
Miracle don't happen that easily!

134
00:09:14,845 --> 00:09:16,483
Sorry for the wait!

135
00:09:17,134 --> 00:09:18,204
Enjoy!

136
00:09:26,618 --> 00:09:28,876
Please don't hold back and enjoy!

137
00:09:29,188 --> 00:09:32,829
Shion, do you understand
the definition of cooking?

138
00:09:32,884 --> 00:09:34,821
Of course I do, Great Rimuru!

139
00:09:34,854 --> 00:09:36,837
What do you think?
It looks delicious, right?

140
00:09:36,862 --> 00:09:38,852
Why the onion is not peeled
and still has its roots

141
00:09:38,877 --> 00:09:41,032
and the tomato still has
its stem as well!

142
00:09:41,057 --> 00:09:44,688
Pull them, cut them, peel them,
there are a lot you should do with it!

143
00:09:44,867 --> 00:09:48,588
Well, if I try to process the ingredients...

144
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:51,064
I might end up cutting it
alongside the building.

145
00:09:51,149 --> 00:09:53,930
Huh? Not the cooking table
but the building?!

146
00:09:53,955 --> 00:09:54,955
Yes.

147
00:09:55,884 --> 00:09:59,860
My sword Gorikimaru can cut really well,
but it's a bit too long.

148
00:09:59,923 --> 00:10:01,587
So you cooked with that?!

149
00:10:01,612 --> 00:10:02,612
Yes!

150
00:10:05,396 --> 00:10:08,483
When I was little,
I thought nothing is impossible.

151
00:10:08,483 --> 00:10:10,048
But it seems like I've mistaken.

152
00:10:10,073 --> 00:10:12,462
Why are you looking so calm?!

153
00:10:12,487 --> 00:10:15,704
Sword is not a cooking utensil,
do you understand?!

154
00:10:15,729 --> 00:10:18,712
Can't you use a kitchen knife
or at least a regular knife?

155
00:10:19,337 --> 00:10:21,663
Gorikimaru is my one and only tool.

156
00:10:21,663 --> 00:10:23,206
Cheating is not an option.

157
00:10:23,206 --> 00:10:24,707
Oh, I see.

158
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:27,877
And I was thinking to give you
a kitchen knife as a present later.

159
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:29,921
I've been mistaken!
It's all my misunderstanding!

160
00:10:29,921 --> 00:10:32,290
Gorikimaru said he's okay
with a little bit of cheating!

161
00:10:32,315 --> 00:10:35,665
I see, well, then use kitchen
knife to cook next time, okay?

162
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:36,690
Yes!

163
00:10:40,774 --> 00:10:44,185
This cooking... well, not sure
if you can even call it one.

164
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:48,228
If you eat this every day, of course
you'd develop poison resistance.

165
00:10:49,921 --> 00:10:51,796
I've evolved into a Demon Lord!

166
00:10:51,821 --> 00:10:54,507
I shouldn't die just from eating
someone's cooking!

167
00:11:11,726 --> 00:11:12,929
Delicious!

168
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:18,734
Why does it taste this delicious
despite how terrible it looks?!

169
00:11:18,874 --> 00:11:20,529
Wh-What is happening?!

170
00:11:21,234 --> 00:11:26,397
Actually, when I came back to life,
I acquired a new skill with the Gift I receive.

171
00:11:26,422 --> 00:11:27,037
Hah?!

172
00:11:27,062 --> 00:11:30,140
A Unique Skill called Master Chef!

173
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:33,538
Master....

174
00:11:33,563 --> 00:11:34,695
...Chef?

175
00:11:35,312 --> 00:11:39,820
With this skill, whatever I cook
will taste just as I want it to be.

176
00:11:40,272 --> 00:11:42,890
I-I see, thank goodness.

177
00:11:42,945 --> 00:11:44,195
Don't you think so, Benimaru?

178
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:45,220
Yes.

179
00:11:46,406 --> 00:11:48,851
Now I can go through this without dying.

180
00:11:49,507 --> 00:11:51,101
Well then, let's eat!

181
00:11:51,126 --> 00:11:51,843
Yes!

182
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:58,070
It looks terrible, but it does taste good.

183
00:11:58,095 --> 00:12:00,140
-Good.
-Yes, yes it is!

184
00:12:00,265 --> 00:12:01,960
It looks terrible, though!

185
00:12:01,985 --> 00:12:03,601
Feel free to ask for seconds!

186
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:06,616
-We have enough!
-Eh?!

187
00:12:10,429 --> 00:12:13,093
We learned something important that day.

188
00:12:13,546 --> 00:12:16,679
That look of the food is also important.

189
00:12:22,706 --> 00:12:26,902
Everyone, I'm sure you already know him,
but let me introduce him once again.

190
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:30,445
This man is Diablo, he saved
me when I was in trouble.

191
00:12:30,969 --> 00:12:33,601
He's a newcomer,
but he's quite strong and dependable.

192
00:12:33,633 --> 00:12:36,047
So I'll have him work
as my second secretary.

193
00:12:36,047 --> 00:12:38,054
I wish you all can get along with him.

194
00:12:38,789 --> 00:12:41,556
I'll greatly appreciate your further
guidance and encouragement.

195
00:12:41,581 --> 00:12:43,879
Everyone, nice to be with you.

196
00:12:47,475 --> 00:12:49,624
Teach him the ropes for me.

197
00:12:49,649 --> 00:12:50,811
Understood.

198
00:12:50,836 --> 00:12:52,453
-And Gabiru.
-Yes!

199
00:12:52,492 --> 00:12:55,149
The development division is
in your care starting today.

200
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:58,111
It'll only be for the time being,
but now you're an executive.

201
00:12:58,111 --> 00:13:00,071
-Eh?!
-I'll be counting on you.

202
00:13:02,437 --> 00:13:06,187
I promise you that I, Gabiru, shall
give it my all to fulfill my duty!

203
00:13:08,257 --> 00:13:09,257
Good.

204
00:13:09,335 --> 00:13:12,208
So now I would like to tell
you guys my plan going forward.

205
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:14,961
It also has to do with the
Three Beastketeers and Youm,

206
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:16,429
so I want you guys to listen too.

207
00:13:16,454 --> 00:13:18,359
We will follow whatever you say, Mister.

208
00:13:18,384 --> 00:13:21,581
It has something to do with
rescuing Great Carrion, I believe?

209
00:13:24,012 --> 00:13:26,476
I had decided to become a Demon Lord.

210
00:13:26,723 --> 00:13:27,557
Yes!

211
00:13:28,725 --> 00:13:30,518
Like I said, a Demon Lord.

212
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:31,570
Yes!

213
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:33,632
Demon Lord...

214
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:45,296
And you've became one.

215
00:13:45,408 --> 00:13:50,329
No, I mean I'm planning to announce
to the world that I'm also a Demon Lord.

216
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:55,084
Oh, so you mean you want to pick
a fight with the other Demon Lords?

217
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:56,919
Yes, precisely!

218
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:59,756
To other Demon Lords,
but to be precise...

219
00:13:59,756 --> 00:14:00,965
Clayman.

220
00:14:06,656 --> 00:14:07,930
I see.

221
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:10,892
So you're planning to take
his Demon Lord position.

222
00:14:10,892 --> 00:14:11,945
Interesting.

223
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:13,117
That's right.

224
00:14:13,273 --> 00:14:16,814
The one behind this whole thing
is Demon Lord Clayman.

225
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:19,617
I have no intention to forgive Clayman.

226
00:14:21,492 --> 00:14:25,281
So I told everyone my plan.

227
00:14:25,907 --> 00:14:28,117
The clean-up of Falmuth Kingdom.

228
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:31,788
The need to check
the Western Holy Church's movement.

229
00:14:31,788 --> 00:14:37,436
And the Demon Lord Clayman's rescue we
promised with people from Animal Kingdom.

230
00:14:37,939 --> 00:14:39,352
-Rigurd.
-Yes!

231
00:14:39,391 --> 00:14:41,664
You handle the negotiation
with the western countries.

232
00:14:41,689 --> 00:14:44,133
My pleasure!
Just leave it to me, Great Rimuru!

233
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:45,510
-Benimaru.
-Yes!

234
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:47,512
Compile a report of
everyone's evolution changes.

235
00:14:47,512 --> 00:14:52,417
To crush Clayman with full force,
we need to know how much power we have.

236
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:54,276
Understood, Great Rimuru.

237
00:14:54,667 --> 00:14:55,776
-Shion.
-Yes!

238
00:14:55,801 --> 00:14:57,271
Go interrogate the POWs.

239
00:14:57,271 --> 00:14:59,190
Leave it to me, Great Rimuru.

240
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:01,818
Listen, don't overdo it, okay?

241
00:15:01,818 --> 00:15:03,449
Rest assured.

242
00:15:03,815 --> 00:15:05,565
That would be great, though...

243
00:15:06,783 --> 00:15:07,949
Youm, Mjurran.

244
00:15:07,949 --> 00:15:08,948
Yes?

245
00:15:08,973 --> 00:15:10,743
Help Shion for me.

246
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:13,760
Get as much inside information
about Falmuth from them.

247
00:15:13,785 --> 00:15:15,208
Let's snatch their country!

248
00:15:15,233 --> 00:15:17,116
Just leave it to me, Mister.

249
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:19,464
It'll be my country, after all.

250
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:24,486
The Three Beastketeers, I like to
request your cooperation, as well.

251
00:15:24,511 --> 00:15:27,760
It will be our greatest pleasure,
Lord of the Jura forest.

252
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:31,744
Just say anything,
we will follow every of your command.

253
00:15:32,878 --> 00:15:33,971
Okay.

254
00:15:33,996 --> 00:15:37,186
Take a rest and build your strength
for the decisive battle to come!

255
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:38,354
-Yes, sir.
-Yeah!

256
00:15:38,861 --> 00:15:39,861
Mr. Rimuru!

257
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:44,839
We've arrived in accordance with
the Blumund and Tempest security treaty!

258
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:46,070
Fuze!

259
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:48,268
I saw many have fallen
throughout the town.

260
00:15:48,293 --> 00:15:50,620
Darn Falmuth, how dare they...!

261
00:15:50,846 --> 00:15:53,744
Eh? Well, they're not lying dead,
they're just sleeping--

262
00:15:54,245 --> 00:15:57,674
It's not much but I brought
in 50 fully armed men.

263
00:15:57,699 --> 00:16:00,918
 All of them are fully prepared.

264
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:04,260
It seems like Falmuth's
main army hasn't arrived.

265
00:16:04,285 --> 00:16:06,799
The king of Blumund promised me
that he'll send his knights--

266
00:16:06,824 --> 00:16:09,151
Ah, Fuze, please pause for a moment.

267
00:16:09,176 --> 00:16:10,628
Oh, my apology.

268
00:16:10,653 --> 00:16:13,063
-Do you already have a strategy planned?
-Well, actually...

269
00:16:13,409 --> 00:16:16,684
A strategy...
Well, rather than a strategy...

270
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:18,561
Is it something to keep secret from us?

271
00:16:18,561 --> 00:16:20,229
It's not about that.

272
00:16:22,023 --> 00:16:23,893
You see, Fuze.

273
00:16:23,918 --> 00:16:28,057
We appreciate your help,
but it's already over.

274
00:16:28,082 --> 00:16:31,072
Huh? Over? What do you mean?

275
00:16:31,628 --> 00:16:32,862
What just ended?

276
00:16:33,206 --> 00:16:35,870
Umm, I'm not sure how to say this.

277
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:41,065
In short, to put it simply,
I killed all of them already.

278
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:42,210
Killed what?

279
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:44,878
The entire Falmuth army!

280
00:16:44,932 --> 00:16:48,128
All of them are already dead! Hahaha!

281
00:17:03,648 --> 00:17:05,066
I understand what you feel.

282
00:17:05,066 --> 00:17:08,344
Why don't you go to the hot spring
and rest for now? Okay?

283
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:15,289
Take the soldiers to the inn
and have them relax.

284
00:17:15,314 --> 00:17:17,766
They went all the trouble to come here,
so be kind to them.

285
00:17:17,791 --> 00:17:19,508
-Yes!
-C'mon, let's go.

286
00:17:19,533 --> 00:17:21,889
W-Wait, can we at least talk a bit--

287
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:24,320
Nn? Another visitor?

288
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:25,610
Visitor?

289
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:26,985
Not to mention...

290
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,759
Report. 30 mounted troops
approaching confirmed.

291
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:34,875
They are led by
the king of Armed Nation of Dwargon.

292
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:38,461
Individual Gazel Dwargon confirmed.

293
00:17:42,289 --> 00:17:44,407
-Hey, Ms. Raphael.
-Yes?

294
00:17:44,432 --> 00:17:50,078
It's a pain to hear reports every time
someone comes, can you please just brief it?

295
00:17:50,103 --> 00:17:51,306
Brief it?

296
00:17:51,821 --> 00:17:55,484
Just tell me when something
hostile approaches, okay?

297
00:17:55,821 --> 00:17:56,961
Understood.

298
00:18:01,622 --> 00:18:03,235
It's been a while, Rimuru.

299
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:05,625
I heard you've become a Demon Lord.

300
00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:08,045
Yeah, a lot happened.

301
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:09,630
To be frank, it's a hassle.

302
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:12,743
But we're doing a meeting to
discuss what to do from now on.

303
00:18:13,149 --> 00:18:16,750
Perfect timing.
Let me participate in that meeting.

304
00:18:22,143 --> 00:18:23,282
What?

305
00:18:27,368 --> 00:18:30,985
Since when?! My Universal Detect
didn't detect them?!

306
00:18:31,027 --> 00:18:31,986
Report.

307
00:18:31,986 --> 00:18:36,164
No clear hostility was detected
from that group.

308
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:39,758
Ah, because I said it
was a pain a while ago.

309
00:18:39,783 --> 00:18:40,719
Hmph.

310
00:18:40,744 --> 00:18:43,851
I'm sorry! I'll be counting on
your report from now on as well!

311
00:18:43,876 --> 00:18:45,149
Okay, Ms. Raphael?

312
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:48,172
Who are you people?

313
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:52,180
Well, well, if this isn't
the underground dweller.

314
00:18:53,446 --> 00:18:55,539
Nonetheless, the emperor himself.

315
00:18:55,635 --> 00:18:57,211
This is surprising.

316
00:18:57,602 --> 00:19:00,922
To find a coward like you trying
to side with a Demon Lord.

317
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:02,500
Ah, it's you.

318
00:19:02,836 --> 00:19:06,382
The descendant of silly elves,
obsessed with high places.

319
00:19:06,852 --> 00:19:09,857
What makes you leave your homeland
embraced by the sacred tree?

320
00:19:10,201 --> 00:19:11,201
No.

321
00:19:11,226 --> 00:19:13,678
That body...
If I guess correctly...

322
00:19:13,756 --> 00:19:15,904
Yeah, it's artificial human.

323
00:19:15,929 --> 00:19:18,263
Created with a homunculus.

324
00:19:18,288 --> 00:19:22,310
One ought to be cautious when
trying to approach a Demon Lord.

325
00:19:22,443 --> 00:19:26,874
Oh, a successful homunculus
indistinguishable from a human.

326
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:29,435
Maybe I should ask them to
teach me how to make one.

327
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:33,506
They're envoys from
the Sorcerous Dynasty of Thalion.

328
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:35,592
You're still the same as always, Elalude.

329
00:19:35,617 --> 00:19:37,468
Same goes for you, Gazel.

330
00:19:37,468 --> 00:19:39,396
So, this person over here...

331
00:19:39,421 --> 00:19:40,471
Ah!

332
00:19:40,471 --> 00:19:44,308
Hello, nice to meet you.
I'm Rimuru, the lord of this forest.

333
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:45,421
Let's get along--

334
00:19:49,896 --> 00:19:51,256
So it's you?!

335
00:19:51,281 --> 00:19:56,018
You bastard! Are you the Demon Lord
who bewitched my daughter?!

336
00:19:56,043 --> 00:19:57,755
Nn? Eh? Eh?!

337
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:00,092
You better be prepared!

338
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:04,381
'O flame, burn, explode, rage.

339
00:20:04,406 --> 00:20:06,365
Gather and burst, tyrannize everything--

340
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:08,428
Hey, what is this old man
doing all of the sudden!?

341
00:20:08,453 --> 00:20:11,365
Report. That is a high-level
fire explosion magic formula.

342
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:12,904
Why is he doing that so suddenly?!

343
00:20:12,929 --> 00:20:15,866
'O flame, burn, explode, rage.

344
00:20:15,891 --> 00:20:17,771
Gather and burst, tyrannize everything--

345
00:20:17,796 --> 00:20:21,040
You giant moron!

346
00:20:27,518 --> 00:20:30,475
Hey, Papa! What are you here for?!

347
00:20:30,506 --> 00:20:32,732
Ah, Eren-chan! You're safe!

348
00:20:32,757 --> 00:20:36,264
Of course I'm safe!
I came here out of my own will!

349
00:20:36,289 --> 00:20:40,114
Well... Sorry about that.

350
00:20:40,114 --> 00:20:43,164
I got a report that my daughter was
kidnapped by a Demon Lord,

351
00:20:43,189 --> 00:20:45,416
so I couldn't resist but to
hurry my way here.

352
00:20:45,670 --> 00:20:47,295
Could't resist my ass.

353
00:20:47,779 --> 00:20:50,115
You're as overly doting as ever, Elalude.

354
00:20:50,185 --> 00:20:51,951
I'm not overly doting.

355
00:20:52,271 --> 00:20:55,921
Eren-chan is cute, so it can't be helped.

356
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:58,201
In general, that's what you call...

357
00:20:58,764 --> 00:21:01,218
No, whatever I say to you,
it's pointless.

358
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:03,345
Mr. Rimuru, this person is my father,

359
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:07,725
the archduke of the Sorcerous
Dynasty of Thalion. Elalude Grimwalt.

360
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:12,897
Lord of the Great Forest of Jura
and the leader of monsters.

361
00:21:12,897 --> 00:21:15,941
Like what my daughter Elyune just told you,

362
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:19,236
My name is Elalude Grimwalt.

363
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:21,545
Please call me Elalude.

364
00:21:23,199 --> 00:21:25,701
I knew her parents are noble,

365
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:28,662
but not even I expect it'd
be someone this important.

366
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:32,029
So did you come all the way
here just to inquire about Eren?

367
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:36,177
Of course not.

368
00:21:36,504 --> 00:21:38,129
Thought so.

369
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:41,884
I want to ascertain with my own eyes.

370
00:21:41,884 --> 00:21:45,221
Just what kind of person is the one
who my daughter has grown so fond of.

371
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:50,262
And if you don't mind,
I'll also join your meeting today.

372
00:21:51,352 --> 00:21:55,559
Why do people like them keep
coming up here like this?

373
00:21:59,032 --> 00:22:05,488
With that, the important meeting to determine
Tempest's next movement begins.

374
00:22:14,671 --> 00:22:18,890
The more you got hurt

375
00:22:19,257 --> 00:22:23,367
That seed of hope

376
00:22:23,874 --> 00:22:27,929
You plant on both of your hand

377
00:22:28,656 --> 00:22:32,179
Will surely bloom someday

378
00:22:32,475 --> 00:22:39,316
Whatever it is,
it doesn't have to last forever

379
00:22:39,882 --> 00:22:42,742
As long it makes you smile

380
00:22:42,767 --> 00:22:48,534
To find the meaning behind
that fleeting moment

381
00:22:48,999 --> 00:22:54,593
Let's go on an journey

382
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:56,488
Together

383
00:22:56,513 --> 00:23:01,048
I ride on that momentary whirlwind

384
00:23:01,073 --> 00:23:05,595
Above the shadow you cast

385
00:23:05,665 --> 00:23:07,322
Reincarnate

386
00:23:07,347 --> 00:23:15,317
The full bloom flower will paint
color on this dreary world

387
00:23:15,342 --> 00:23:19,677
If you were reincarnated

388
00:23:19,936 --> 00:23:24,488
I'd be with you wherever you go

389
00:23:24,513 --> 00:23:27,318
Our souls are connected

390
00:23:27,343 --> 00:23:33,091
I'll always by your side

391
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:40,169
Next time, "Man-and-Monster Summit."
