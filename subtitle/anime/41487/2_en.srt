1
00:00:08,258 --> 00:00:13,597
(Holy Empire of Lubelius - Inner Temple)

2
00:00:19,811 --> 00:00:21,788
Ouch...

3
00:00:21,813 --> 00:00:24,047
What's up with you?!

4
00:00:24,495 --> 00:00:27,166
This place is supposed to be sacred...

5
00:00:27,611 --> 00:00:30,171
Why is a Vampire here?!

6
00:00:30,242 --> 00:00:31,632
Silence!

7
00:00:31,657 --> 00:00:33,991
You maggot who dare to defile the seat of God!

8
00:00:33,992 --> 00:00:38,140
Staining the presence of the One God Luminus is absolutely unforgivable!

9
00:00:39,351 --> 00:00:40,351
Crap!

10
00:00:41,203 --> 00:00:42,703
Shatter!

11
00:00:44,406 --> 00:00:46,726
This might be... bad...

12
00:01:07,717 --> 00:01:11,396
Fate repeats all over again

13
00:01:11,468 --> 00:01:13,771
The voices of my heart say

14
00:01:13,889 --> 00:01:16,934
Time is not enough, it's over

15
00:01:18,106 --> 00:01:22,357
Belief that makes me who I am

16
00:01:22,483 --> 00:01:24,716
Light doesn't fade away

17
00:01:24,804 --> 00:01:27,560
Made my mind up now, it's better

18
00:01:29,421 --> 00:01:33,045
Yeah I know it's not an easy road

19
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:34,968
Lured by your hands

20
00:01:34,993 --> 00:01:38,552
Even if it rains don't be swayed

21
00:01:38,577 --> 00:01:40,599
Being same as always

22
00:01:40,624 --> 00:01:43,287
Want to feel my destiny

23
00:01:43,312 --> 00:01:45,912
Open my eyes to be braver

24
00:01:45,937 --> 00:01:49,114
Get up now Get up now stronger

25
00:01:49,139 --> 00:01:51,414
I believe in myself

26
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:54,640
Stand up now Stand up now shouting

27
00:01:54,982 --> 00:01:57,381
I'll never run away

28
00:01:57,406 --> 00:02:02,045
I might lose control

29
00:02:02,849 --> 00:02:08,224
It's a perfect world

30
00:02:08,709 --> 00:02:13,747
Destroy all of it, in the end it's for our good

31
00:02:13,772 --> 00:02:16,927
Let me shout like flames

32
00:02:18,646 --> 00:02:20,848
Hey, Laplace. (Episode 38: Man-and-Monster Summit)

33
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:22,892
I heard you had it rough this time. (Episode 38: Man-and-Monster Summit)

34
00:02:22,893 --> 00:02:26,613
So, did you learn anything about the Western Holy Church?

35
00:02:26,647 --> 00:02:29,265
Well, about that....

36
00:02:29,676 --> 00:02:32,496
The security was too strict, it was impossible!

37
00:02:32,867 --> 00:02:36,390
Hmm, so? At least you found some clues, didn't you?

38
00:02:36,415 --> 00:02:39,075
Man, I went through a lot of trouble to get this information,

39
00:02:39,076 --> 00:02:41,370
I thought I could sell it for a high price.

40
00:02:42,191 --> 00:02:43,704
You're a liar after all.

41
00:02:43,729 --> 00:02:45,649
You sure are mean.

42
00:02:45,681 --> 00:02:51,609
I really sympathize with that slime who unknowingly got caught in your scheme.

43
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:53,512
As expected from a weirdo...

44
00:02:53,536 --> 00:02:58,582
holding the position as Grandmaster and a twisted ambition at the same time.

45
00:02:58,652 --> 00:03:00,863
Mister Yuuki Kagurazaka.

46
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:05,760
I appreciate the compliment, but I won't increase the retainer fee.

47
00:03:05,883 --> 00:03:08,175
I really can't hold a candle to you, huh.

48
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:12,274
Don't be like that, I already got your remuneration prepared.

49
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:13,579
Eh?! Seriously?!

50
00:03:13,604 --> 00:03:19,199
Yeah, I safely transferred your president's soul that was inside me into a homunculus.

51
00:03:19,566 --> 00:03:22,558
The president is finally back!

52
00:03:22,583 --> 00:03:24,558
Where is he? Hurry up and let me meet him!

53
00:03:24,583 --> 00:03:27,425
Calm down, he's been there since a while ago.

54
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:28,450
Huh?!

55
00:03:30,127 --> 00:03:33,519
Eh? This... pretty lady over here?

56
00:03:36,997 --> 00:03:41,012
What's up with that getup? Did you get yourself a new hobby?

57
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:43,305
Shut up, Laplace.

58
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:46,100
It's our reunion after 200 years.

59
00:03:46,101 --> 00:03:48,520
Is that how you behave infront of me, Demon Lord Kazaream?

60
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:52,125
Welcome back, President Kazaream.

61
00:03:52,672 --> 00:03:55,568
The Moderate Harlequin Alliance has been waiting for you.

62
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:58,279
Me, as well as Footman and Tear.

63
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,066
And Clayman, too.

64
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:05,285
Sorry for interrupting in the middle of your touching reunion.

65
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:09,123
But Demon Lord Kazaream's revival is still far from complete.

66
00:04:09,124 --> 00:04:10,332
That's right.

67
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:14,496
To be frank, my current power is still far from my prime.

68
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:17,882
Leon Cromwell... That annoying bastard!

69
00:04:17,883 --> 00:04:21,260
Wish you can cut me some slack about your new body.

70
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:23,324
It costs me quite a fortune for that.

71
00:04:23,349 --> 00:04:24,972
I understand, Boss.

72
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:27,167
You got this custom-made from Thalion, right?

73
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:31,020
It's weak and not exactly my cup of tea,

74
00:04:31,021 --> 00:04:34,886
but having a material body I can move myself is better than none.

75
00:04:36,972 --> 00:04:39,988
Hey! How long are you going to keep laughing, Laplace!

76
00:04:40,018 --> 00:04:44,174
Anyway, can we get to the main topic now?

77
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:47,871
You got something about the Western Holy Church, didn't you?

78
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:49,747
Right.

79
00:04:49,748 --> 00:04:53,918
If the President calls you Boss, then you're my Boss as well.

80
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:56,878
Allow me to tell you straightly without any games.

81
00:04:58,381 --> 00:05:02,593
There was nothing out of ordinary at the Western Holy Church HQ.

82
00:05:02,594 --> 00:05:04,782
After all, the worshipers come there too.

83
00:05:04,807 --> 00:05:07,973
There's no way they will just have dangerous stuff placed obviously.

84
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:11,852
So I decided to head to the top of the sacred mountain.

85
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:13,938
I figured there might be something inside the Inner Temple

86
00:05:13,939 --> 00:05:16,524
that only the Holy Emperor is allowed to enter.

87
00:05:16,525 --> 00:05:17,942
But then...

88
00:05:17,943 --> 00:05:22,212
A distinguished-looking vampire bugger started shooting red beams

89
00:05:22,237 --> 00:05:25,074
and he destroyed me into pieces.

90
00:05:25,075 --> 00:05:27,366
Wait, then how are you alive?

91
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:30,246
You said he shot red beams?

92
00:05:30,247 --> 00:05:31,288
Yub.

93
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:35,639
That's a technique called Blood Ray that turns blood into magical particle and shoot it.

94
00:05:36,046 --> 00:05:37,587
Demon Lord Valentin.

95
00:05:37,612 --> 00:05:41,298
He's known under the alias of Bloody Lord, and that technique is a specialty of his.

96
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:43,634
Demon Lord?! For real?!

97
00:05:43,635 --> 00:05:45,803
You made the right decision to run away, Laplace.

98
00:05:45,804 --> 00:05:48,960
He was a man whose power rivaled my own during my prime.

99
00:05:51,228 --> 00:05:55,855
There will always be huge damage to our surroundings every time we fought.

100
00:05:55,856 --> 00:06:00,776
As a result, the custom where we settle things with majority votes was born.

101
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:03,070
Is that by any chance the Walpurgis?

102
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:04,030
Yes.

103
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:06,073
A motion with three votes

104
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:09,034
is a remnant of when there were only seven Demon Lords.

105
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:12,621
Then assuming he really is Demon Lord Valentin.

106
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:14,939
Why would he be in such a place?

107
00:06:15,611 --> 00:06:17,459
The most likely reason is...

108
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:20,656
The Holy Emperor's true identity is a Demon Lord, I suppose?

109
00:06:20,712 --> 00:06:24,550
Valentin only sees human and demi-human as food.

110
00:06:24,551 --> 00:06:28,781
If a man like him is calling himself the protector of humanity, then...

111
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:32,183
There must be something behind it.

112
00:06:33,018 --> 00:06:35,436
Whatever the case, this is an useful information.

113
00:06:35,437 --> 00:06:37,605
Good job, Laplace.

114
00:06:37,606 --> 00:06:41,191
I want to investigate the Western Holy Church more,

115
00:06:41,192 --> 00:06:45,155
but with Demon Lord Valentin around, we can't do anything reckless.

116
00:06:45,805 --> 00:06:50,062
Well, just luring the Demon Lords won't be that hard, isn't it?

117
00:06:50,087 --> 00:06:51,087
Hmm?

118
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:55,289
Clayman, Demon Lord Milim, and Demon Lord Frey.

119
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:58,680
We can do a lot of stuff if three Demon Lords work together, right?

120
00:06:59,219 --> 00:07:01,048
Why don't we just hold it?

121
00:07:01,073 --> 00:07:02,714
The Walpurgis.

122
00:07:06,516 --> 00:07:08,492
Quite a smart idea coming from you.

123
00:07:08,555 --> 00:07:09,945
Right?

124
00:07:10,472 --> 00:07:13,625
Well then, how will he make his move?

125
00:07:13,953 --> 00:07:15,735
That little squishy guy.

126
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:24,026
Moving on, this is Diablo who will join us as the new second secretary.

127
00:07:24,027 --> 00:07:26,403
Pleased to meet you.

128
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:29,453
And the manager of Jura Forest.

129
00:07:29,741 --> 00:07:31,820
Treyni the Dryad.

130
00:07:33,078 --> 00:07:36,246
That concludes our introduction from Tempest.

131
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:39,594
Moving on, let me introduce the visitors.

132
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:43,672
From the Armed Nation of Dwargon, King Gazel Dwargo.

133
00:07:44,756 --> 00:07:48,175
From the Sorcerous Dynasty of Thalion, Archduke Erald.

134
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:49,422
Nice to meet you.

135
00:07:49,781 --> 00:07:52,516
From the Animal Kingdom of Eurazania's brigade,

136
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:56,617
Albis, Suphia, and Phobio of The Three Beastketeers.

137
00:07:57,185 --> 00:08:00,980
From the Kingdom of Blumund, Guildmaster Fuze.

138
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:02,297
Y-Yes.

139
00:08:02,516 --> 00:08:05,820
Lastly, representing the Kingdom of Falmuth from now on,

140
00:08:05,845 --> 00:08:08,914
Grucius, Mjurran, and Youm.

141
00:08:11,366 --> 00:08:12,992
Nice to be with you.

142
00:08:15,664 --> 00:08:18,649
We sure got quite a member in this meeting.

143
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:22,835
Shuna, what's Veldora doing right now?

144
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:27,016
I believe he has done changing and will now be heading here in no time.

145
00:08:31,744 --> 00:08:34,260
Everyone, kept you all waiting!

146
00:08:34,554 --> 00:08:36,898
Oh my, it looks good on you.

147
00:08:36,923 --> 00:08:38,875
It fits you perfectly.

148
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:40,351
Right?

149
00:08:40,376 --> 00:08:42,271
It is a nice outfit indeed.

150
00:08:42,272 --> 00:08:43,781
I bestow you with my thank.

151
00:08:43,806 --> 00:08:45,233
Thank you very much.

152
00:08:46,547 --> 00:08:48,789
Rimuru, is he one of your men?

153
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:51,947
He looks new.

154
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:55,492
Yeah, let me introduce you to my sworn friend.

155
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:56,852
It's Veldora.

156
00:08:58,038 --> 00:08:58,913
Veldora?

157
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:00,081
Veldora?

158
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:01,813
Vel...dora?

159
00:09:08,836 --> 00:09:11,828
I am the Storm Dragon Veldora Tempest!

160
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:16,472
Only a select few people have ever seen me in flesh.

161
00:09:16,473 --> 00:09:18,390
So you people are fortunate.

162
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:20,358
You can feel proud.

163
00:09:22,094 --> 00:09:24,110
Oh no, he passed out.

164
00:09:24,135 --> 00:09:25,383
Can't blame him.

165
00:09:26,094 --> 00:09:27,570
Overwhelmed with joy, I see.

166
00:09:27,595 --> 00:09:28,969
No he's not!

167
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:30,453
Hey, Veldora.

168
00:09:30,478 --> 00:09:33,280
We're going to have a very serious discussion,

169
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:34,948
so don't get in the way, okay?

170
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:39,620
I would love it if you can stay nice and quiet during the meeting.

171
00:09:39,621 --> 00:09:42,906
Or you can just go take a walk for a while, if you like.

172
00:09:44,066 --> 00:09:46,794
Don't be like that. We're sworn friends, besties!

173
00:09:46,795 --> 00:09:49,719
Just don't leave me out of the fun, okay?

174
00:09:49,744 --> 00:09:50,757
Rimuru!

175
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:53,426
I have something to talk about with you.

176
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,887
Ah, me too.

177
00:09:56,596 --> 00:10:01,508
And like that, the important meeting to determine the future of Tempest...

178
00:10:01,774 --> 00:10:04,729
...got canceled before it even began.

179
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,047
Well then, excuse me.

180
00:10:16,078 --> 00:10:17,360
What does this mean?!

181
00:10:17,385 --> 00:10:19,860
The Storm Dragon Veldora has been revived?!

182
00:10:20,008 --> 00:10:22,414
Well, to put it simply...

183
00:10:22,439 --> 00:10:24,711
But before that, let me tell you one thing.

184
00:10:24,797 --> 00:10:26,209
Y-Yes?

185
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:32,422
I've been entrusted with full authority from the Emperor of Sorcerous Dynasty of Thalion.

186
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:36,000
My words will decide Thalion's position in this matter.

187
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:38,303
With that in mind.

188
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:40,454
I want you to give your explanation.

189
00:10:40,479 --> 00:10:42,224
Okay, okay, I understand.

190
00:10:42,225 --> 00:10:45,246
I promise I will be honest.

191
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:49,857
So I tell them my story.

192
00:10:49,858 --> 00:10:53,211
That I got reincarnated as a slime in this world.

193
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:56,875
That I met Veldora in the Sealed Cave.

194
00:10:57,365 --> 00:11:00,672
And after a lot of things, I became a Demon Lord.

195
00:11:00,697 --> 00:11:03,036
I revived my dead allies.

196
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:06,211
Then, I unlocked Veldora's seal.

197
00:11:08,485 --> 00:11:11,289
And that leads to where we're at right now.

198
00:11:12,195 --> 00:11:13,727
Hey?

199
00:11:13,752 --> 00:11:15,591
This is too unexpected.

200
00:11:15,592 --> 00:11:18,492
You becoming a Demon Lord is a problem big enough by itself.

201
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:21,367
But to think you'd give an even bigger problem on top of it.

202
00:11:21,392 --> 00:11:23,474
Oh, thank you for the compliment!

203
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:29,735
Mister Rimuru, is that person really is the real Storm Dragon?

204
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:33,125
-Well, I wonder-- -No, that must be the case.

205
00:11:33,443 --> 00:11:38,780
There is no human nor monster foolish enough to call themselves the Evil Dragon.

206
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:40,563
Thought so.

207
00:11:41,351 --> 00:11:42,578
But still...

208
00:11:42,603 --> 00:11:44,328
What should we do about this?

209
00:11:44,735 --> 00:11:47,164
Announce it or hide it.

210
00:11:47,165 --> 00:11:50,626
Either way, we don't have to worry about the Western Nations.

211
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:55,339
For Sorcerous Dynasty of Thalion, I will simply report this to the Emperor.

212
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:56,840
But the problem is...

213
00:11:56,841 --> 00:11:59,063
The Western Holy Church.

214
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:01,914
Keeping it a secret from them is impossible.

215
00:12:01,991 --> 00:12:06,725
Even among dragons, they are especially hostile towards the Storm Dragon.

216
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:10,938
And they would likely already notice his revival by now.

217
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:16,151
Seems like these two get along pretty well, huh.

218
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:17,328
Are you listening, Rimuru?!

219
00:12:17,353 --> 00:12:18,649
Y-Yes!

220
00:12:18,674 --> 00:12:21,448
We need you to think about this seriously.

221
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:23,086
I'm sorry.

222
00:12:23,969 --> 00:12:27,537
Well, I already plan to announce Veldora's revival anyway.

223
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:31,083
And it doesn't seem like we can avoid facing the Western Holy Church anyway.

224
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:32,945
We just have to deal with it somehow.

225
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:37,382
If you already made your decision, then that's all from me.

226
00:12:37,985 --> 00:12:40,759
Demon Lord and Dragon working together.

227
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,633
Is there even be anything more troublesome than this?

228
00:12:43,658 --> 00:12:45,348
It's not a laughing matter.

229
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:48,313
But this is a good thing for me.

230
00:12:48,935 --> 00:12:50,524
Is that so?

231
00:12:52,758 --> 00:12:56,320
Because I got myself to participate in this summit.

232
00:12:56,424 --> 00:12:58,711
And I just got my hand on valuable information

233
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:01,797
to decide Thalion's stance in this matter.

234
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:08,120
Picking up a fight with a nation with Demon Lord and Dragon working together

235
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:09,477
is just foolish.

236
00:13:09,502 --> 00:13:11,195
That's true.

237
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:18,130
So if we became enemies of the Western Holy Church, you would still side with us?

238
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:19,881
Can I take your words as such?

239
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:21,341
Rimuru.

240
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:26,013
You really need to work on improving your thought reading skills.

241
00:13:26,014 --> 00:13:27,553
O-Okay...

242
00:13:28,099 --> 00:13:29,641
So I'm saying.

243
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:34,730
There just no reason for us to oppose you at cost of exposing our nation to danger.

244
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:37,983
And Dwargon owes no favors to the Western Holy Church whatsoever.

245
00:13:37,984 --> 00:13:39,192
You understand?

246
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:40,153
Yeah.

247
00:13:40,154 --> 00:13:43,197
It's reassuring to have King Gazel on our side.

248
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:45,631
But Sir Erald.

249
00:13:45,912 --> 00:13:48,463
We haven't even established diplomatic relations with Thalion,

250
00:13:48,488 --> 00:13:50,496
so why you care so much about us?

251
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:57,419
Mister Rimuru, please address me with my name and title when in public.

252
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:59,671
You're the leader of a nation.

253
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:03,053
You don't have to lower yourself to other nation's officials.

254
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:07,615
Well, be it with Mister or Sir, you can just call me however you like.

255
00:14:08,998 --> 00:14:11,178
Got it. Thank you.

256
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:13,092
That aside.

257
00:14:13,217 --> 00:14:15,318
Let me answer your question.

258
00:14:15,592 --> 00:14:17,599
To begin with, my daughter little Ere--

259
00:14:17,624 --> 00:14:18,624
-Eh? -Mnn?

260
00:14:20,443 --> 00:14:24,571
Eryune was the one who told you the method to become a Demon Lord,

261
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:27,418
and her responsbility on the matter were questioned.

262
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:31,286
Tell me more about that resurrection fairy tale.

263
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:32,349
Okay.

264
00:14:32,914 --> 00:14:38,794
You can even say that my daughter has caused the birth of a new Demon Lord.

265
00:14:38,795 --> 00:14:43,007
However, only the Emperor and I know about this.

266
00:14:43,508 --> 00:14:46,530
So we decided to first ascertain Mister Rimuru's character.

267
00:14:46,555 --> 00:14:50,472
Should it be needed, we're ready to dispatch a subjugation party.

268
00:14:50,473 --> 00:14:53,334
That's why I came all the way here to meet you.

269
00:14:53,768 --> 00:14:56,020
So what's your verdict?

270
00:14:56,521 --> 00:15:00,232
As mentioned before, Thalion choose amity.

271
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:02,109
That's the only natural option.

272
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:07,845
Dwargon is ready to support Tempest as an allied nation, from the start.

273
00:15:09,367 --> 00:15:12,006
But it's not like there is no problem.

274
00:15:12,394 --> 00:15:17,660
There are too many casualties from Falmuth army caused by Mister Rimuru.

275
00:15:17,834 --> 00:15:20,836
We're talking about a Demon Lord who caused the death of 20,000 lives.

276
00:15:20,837 --> 00:15:22,732
You can rest assured.

277
00:15:23,506 --> 00:15:26,045
All the corpses are gone with no trace.

278
00:15:26,373 --> 00:15:29,545
And there are no survivors either.

279
00:15:30,115 --> 00:15:33,318
That means we can put any narrative we want.

280
00:15:33,343 --> 00:15:37,019
We just have to convince the people.

281
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:41,273
Rimuru, a king does not have the time to make regrets.

282
00:15:41,274 --> 00:15:44,553
Yeah, I only did what was necessary.

283
00:15:44,819 --> 00:15:47,068
I already made my resolve.

284
00:15:47,697 --> 00:15:49,001
Then that's great.

285
00:15:49,967 --> 00:15:51,662
Well then, let me explain.

286
00:15:51,687 --> 00:15:53,193
Listen well.

287
00:15:53,218 --> 00:15:55,115
Our story will be like this...

288
00:15:55,788 --> 00:16:00,478
After that, we began to discuss things in full detail

289
00:16:00,503 --> 00:16:03,119
then returned to resume the meeting.

290
00:16:08,279 --> 00:16:09,748
Are you okay?

291
00:16:11,123 --> 00:16:15,131
I wish you could tell me something that important ahead of time.

292
00:16:15,349 --> 00:16:17,388
Eh? Did I forget to tell you?

293
00:16:17,413 --> 00:16:19,458
Well, it's over already anyway.

294
00:16:19,483 --> 00:16:20,979
Don't just end it like that!

295
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,123
If you're that energetic, then you're good enough.

296
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:26,235
Jeez, how should I report this to the higher-up anyway?

297
00:16:28,326 --> 00:16:30,780
Well then, let's resume the meeting!

298
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:32,967
Lets begin this with a recap.

299
00:16:33,743 --> 00:16:37,454
Once again, I tell the story of how I got reincarnated as a slime,

300
00:16:37,455 --> 00:16:41,082
meeting Veldora, and everything leading up to where we are at right now.

301
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:42,310
And then...

302
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:46,131
Your town is an hindrance.

303
00:16:46,497 --> 00:16:48,318
That's why we're going to crush it.

304
00:16:48,343 --> 00:16:50,443
I have no interest in words from a monster!

305
00:16:55,959 --> 00:16:57,891
Exhaust everything!

306
00:16:57,892 --> 00:16:59,599
Disintegration!

307
00:17:20,597 --> 00:17:21,917
Really?

308
00:17:21,942 --> 00:17:24,410
You fought that Hinata Sakaguchi?

309
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:27,668
Yeah, she was an formidable opponent.

310
00:17:28,113 --> 00:17:30,840
She wouldn't listen to anything I say.

311
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:34,253
She's like a cold merciless murderer.

312
00:17:35,638 --> 00:17:36,660
What is it?

313
00:17:36,685 --> 00:17:41,560
Well, she just sounded quite different compared to the intel we have.

314
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:42,832
As in?

315
00:17:43,339 --> 00:17:48,183
She always lends a hand to anyone who asked for her help.

316
00:17:48,707 --> 00:17:51,945
Though she also won't bother with anyone who doesn't listen to her advice.

317
00:17:51,946 --> 00:17:56,472
In other words, she's supposed to be a very reasonable and rational person.

318
00:17:59,537 --> 00:18:01,621
Just as I expect from Guildmaster of Blumund Kingdom,

319
00:18:01,622 --> 00:18:03,957
you're as good in information as people say.

320
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:07,335
What he said matches to what I know of her as well.

321
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:09,907
Same goes for us.

322
00:18:10,298 --> 00:18:15,510
She's the most exemplary knight who never once break the Luminism doctrine.

323
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:19,043
In order words, a proper guardian of law and order.

324
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:24,464
Then why someone like her didn't even try to stop the summoning rituals?

325
00:18:24,772 --> 00:18:27,814
Summoning children from another world by force.

326
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:30,901
No matter how you think about it, it's not a morally right thing to do.

327
00:18:31,861 --> 00:18:38,026
But we don't really know if she really allows those summons to happen, right?

328
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:44,051
The summon magic to summon Otherworlder is a forbidden technique

329
00:18:44,076 --> 00:18:46,666
that one can't simply reveal to public.

330
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:50,880
The Council of the West also declares it as a prohibited matter.

331
00:18:51,652 --> 00:18:56,324
Even if you ask them, I doubt those nation will just admit so easily.

332
00:18:57,026 --> 00:18:59,971
If they say they didn't do it, then that's the end of it?

333
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:01,181
Yes.

334
00:19:01,182 --> 00:19:04,059
As for why she didn't listen to your words,

335
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:05,685
I believe it's because there's a law

336
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:09,894
saying it's prohibited to make deal with monsters in Luminism teaching.

337
00:19:11,441 --> 00:19:14,066
So there wasn't even a chance for me to talk?

338
00:19:14,737 --> 00:19:18,948
If the Western Holy Church declares us as "The Enemy of God,"

339
00:19:18,949 --> 00:19:21,284
Hinata will just obey that, right?

340
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:23,120
She likely will.

341
00:19:26,511 --> 00:19:30,168
Then should I go and dispose of her for you?

342
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:33,150
Hey there, Hinata is a powerful opponent, you know?

343
00:19:33,175 --> 00:19:34,881
Can you really dispose her?

344
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:36,926
He's right, Diablo.

345
00:19:37,468 --> 00:19:39,636
Instead of letting someone like you to go,

346
00:19:39,637 --> 00:19:41,680
I can finish it neat by myself.

347
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:44,207
Great Rimuru, just leave it to me.

348
00:19:44,363 --> 00:19:46,506
Oh my, Miss Shion.

349
00:19:46,531 --> 00:19:49,562
I owe you a favor for teaching me how to be a secretary,

350
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:51,509
so it pains me to say this.

351
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:55,527
But unfortunately, I fear you can't win against Hinata.

352
00:19:55,528 --> 00:19:57,278
You sure talk funny.

353
00:19:57,279 --> 00:20:00,907
Are you trying to say that you're stronger than me?

354
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:02,783
Then why don't we make it clear who is superior--

355
00:20:02,808 --> 00:20:04,495
You don't have to!

356
00:20:05,658 --> 00:20:08,432
Veldora... You too?

357
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:12,961
I-I-I-I wasn't thinking to join or anything!

358
00:20:12,962 --> 00:20:16,634
Unless she comes to us, we have no reason to come to her.

359
00:20:16,659 --> 00:20:18,478
Eeeeeh?

360
00:20:18,503 --> 00:20:19,955
Don't "Eh" me!

361
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:23,150
It's not like I want to fight the Western Holy Church.

362
00:20:23,205 --> 00:20:24,549
I'm saying this to you two, too.

363
00:20:24,574 --> 00:20:26,002
-I'm sorry. -I'm sorry.

364
00:20:28,185 --> 00:20:33,565
Anyway, that will be all regarding Hinata and the Western Holy Church.

365
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:36,651
We might have to fight them depending on how they move.

366
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:40,071
But in the meantime, we will just have to keep a close eye on them.

367
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:41,502
-Yes! -Understood.

368
00:20:43,644 --> 00:20:46,307
It's pointless to play dumb. We have an informant.

369
00:20:47,037 --> 00:20:48,246
Informant?

370
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:51,511
We have 'eyes' all over Engrassia.

371
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:54,962
There is someone who sold me to Hinata.

372
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:58,519
Only a few people know that I killed Shizu.

373
00:20:59,133 --> 00:21:00,640
The suspicious one would be...

374
00:21:01,269 --> 00:21:02,269
Report.

375
00:21:02,410 --> 00:21:05,011
The most likely individual would be...

376
00:21:05,878 --> 00:21:10,059
Yeah, Raphael. It's the same one I had in mind.

377
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:11,191
So it seems.

378
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:14,689
If so, then what's his goal?

379
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:17,817
To make us fight to dispose one of us?

380
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:20,028
To prevent me from returning to the town?

381
00:21:20,029 --> 00:21:21,863
To lure out Hinata?

382
00:21:21,864 --> 00:21:23,987
Or perhaps, all of those.

383
00:21:24,222 --> 00:21:26,785
Seriously? Just how greedy is he?

384
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:28,472
Rimuru.

385
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:30,519
Ah, sorry.

386
00:21:30,839 --> 00:21:32,666
I was thinking about something.

387
00:21:33,042 --> 00:21:35,127
Well then, let's move on to the main topic.

388
00:21:37,588 --> 00:21:43,344
It's finally time to discuss the topic that will determine the future of Tempest.

389
00:21:47,943 --> 00:21:49,514
Ramiris?!

390
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:52,873
What's up all of the sudden?

391
00:21:53,959 --> 00:21:55,896
I heard all about it!

392
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:59,651
This country, Tempest, will be destroyed!

393
00:21:59,652 --> 00:22:00,771
Wha--

394
00:22:01,342 --> 00:22:04,568
What did you say?!

395
00:22:14,731 --> 00:22:18,950
The more you got hurt

396
00:22:19,317 --> 00:22:23,427
That seed of hope

397
00:22:23,934 --> 00:22:27,989
You plant on both of your hand

398
00:22:28,716 --> 00:22:32,239
Will surely bloom someday

399
00:22:32,535 --> 00:22:38,250
Whatever it is, it doesn't have to last forever

400
00:22:39,942 --> 00:22:42,802
As long as it makes you smile

401
00:22:42,827 --> 00:22:48,528
To find the meaning behind that fleeting moment

402
00:22:49,059 --> 00:22:54,653
Let's go on a journey

403
00:22:55,639 --> 00:22:56,548
Together

404
00:22:56,573 --> 00:23:01,108
I ride on that momentary whirlwind

405
00:23:01,133 --> 00:23:05,655
Above the shadow you cast

406
00:23:05,725 --> 00:23:07,382
Reincarnate

407
00:23:07,407 --> 00:23:15,377
The full bloom flower will paint color on this dreary world

408
00:23:15,402 --> 00:23:19,737
If you were reincarnated

409
00:23:19,996 --> 00:23:24,548
I'd be with you wherever you go

410
00:23:24,573 --> 00:23:27,378
Our souls are connected

411
00:23:27,403 --> 00:23:33,151
I'll always by your side

412
00:23:37,207 --> 00:23:40,127
Next time, "Ramiris's Report."
