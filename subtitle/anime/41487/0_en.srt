1
00:00:03,753 --> 00:00:05,858
Lord Veldora, it's a check.

2
00:00:05,883 --> 00:00:08,796
Hmm, you've improved well, Ifrit.

3
00:00:08,976 --> 00:00:10,226
Thank you.

4
00:00:10,251 --> 00:00:12,475
That's the spirit, Ifrit.

5
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:15,874
Climb your way up to my level.

6
00:00:16,124 --> 00:00:18,960
I shall wait eagerly for that day to come.

7
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:21,053
Y-Yes!

8
00:00:21,272 --> 00:00:24,022
But I'm the one who won this time, though.

9
00:00:24,523 --> 00:00:27,840
However, we might not have that much time left.

10
00:00:27,972 --> 00:00:29,042
Lord Veldora?

11
00:00:30,217 --> 00:00:34,186
I might not be able to stay here for much longer.

12
00:00:34,389 --> 00:00:36,155
Wh-What did you say?!

13
00:00:36,365 --> 00:00:38,662
The time I spent with you was wonderful.

14
00:00:38,663 --> 00:00:40,585
A lot has happened.

15
00:00:54,345 --> 00:00:59,307
Let's give a name to a nameless flower

16
00:00:59,308 --> 00:01:04,312
So that it won't freeze from the coldness of solitude

17
00:01:04,313 --> 00:01:09,067
If it's as frail as it is beautiful

18
00:01:09,068 --> 00:01:11,987
Then it's not as fragile anymore

19
00:01:13,572 --> 00:01:18,451
Like how you paint color on a transparent body

20
00:01:18,452 --> 00:01:21,496
Beyond the page of the chapter

21
00:01:21,497 --> 00:01:24,208
It's welcoming you with a smile

22
00:01:25,751 --> 00:01:28,628
Whenever, as much as it takes

23
00:01:28,629 --> 00:01:31,631
Let's start a new world

24
00:01:31,632 --> 00:01:35,426
We're Storyteller

25
00:01:35,427 --> 00:01:39,556
All the love, hope, envy

26
00:01:39,557 --> 00:01:41,474
Even the song of despair we sing today

27
00:01:41,475 --> 00:01:45,520
It will all be a seed and bloom, into a strong person

28
00:01:45,521 --> 00:01:51,526
Why does salvation born from someone's tear

29
00:01:51,527 --> 00:01:56,823
That's just sad

30
00:01:56,824 --> 00:02:03,663
Ideal and fantasy, all mixed up by youthful impulse

31
00:02:03,664 --> 00:02:10,421
My real self, is now reborn!

32
00:02:12,065 --> 00:02:17,436
After Rimuru fulfilled his mission to save Shizu's students in Engrassia,

33
00:02:17,461 --> 00:02:19,930
he returns to Tempest.

34
00:02:21,115 --> 00:02:22,312
That mask...

35
00:02:22,337 --> 00:02:23,684
What about it?

36
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:28,814
It appears to be the one worn by the Hero who sealed me.

37
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:31,030
Or maybe it just looks like one?

38
00:02:31,388 --> 00:02:35,863
So the hero handed it to Shizu, and it goes to Chloe through Rimuru.

39
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:38,366
Is there some sort of connection?

40
00:02:38,367 --> 00:02:41,285
Nah, it can't be. Yeah, I'm just overthinking it.

41
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:45,039
That time I thought the peaceful days will just continue

42
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,140
after Rimuru's back at monster town.

43
00:02:48,165 --> 00:02:50,670
I also didn't think much about it.

44
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:54,668
But one of Shizu's disciple, Sakaguchi Hinata.

45
00:03:01,682 --> 00:03:03,903
Because of Hinata's wide range barrier,

46
00:03:03,928 --> 00:03:05,559
the magicule in the area gets purified

47
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:08,312
and Lord Rimuru is unable to use his full power.

48
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:12,066
That woman really just won't listen to anything he says.

49
00:03:12,067 --> 00:03:14,572
She seems to be quite hard-headed.

50
00:03:14,597 --> 00:03:17,905
I never thought someone would corner Lord Rimuru like this.

51
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:19,755
He might lose.

52
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:21,247
N-No way!

53
00:03:21,272 --> 00:03:22,618
Is it okay?

54
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:25,330
If he dies, then we won't be safe either.

55
00:03:27,107 --> 00:03:28,843
Fret not.

56
00:03:28,982 --> 00:03:32,272
Just believe in Rimuru and watch.

57
00:03:32,385 --> 00:03:34,789
Rimuru has an idea.

58
00:03:35,249 --> 00:03:37,077
Exhaust everything!

59
00:03:37,297 --> 00:03:39,381
Disintegration!

60
00:03:49,262 --> 00:03:50,902
As I expect of him.

61
00:03:50,927 --> 00:03:54,097
Rimuru already prepared a Body Double in advance.

62
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:58,447
He lets his Body Double fight Hinata, while the real him hides in safety.

63
00:03:58,488 --> 00:04:01,215
H-How clever of him!

64
00:04:01,345 --> 00:04:06,370
It's still a risky bet, but I'm impressed.

65
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:08,968
Looks like he can go home now.

66
00:04:09,073 --> 00:04:11,970
About that, I actually sensed something odd.

67
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:14,652
Nnn?

68
00:04:14,677 --> 00:04:17,083
Something is happening in Tempest?

69
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:23,316
The human is blinded by greed and attacks the nation of monsters.

70
00:04:23,472 --> 00:04:26,280
They really are a bothersome creature.

71
00:04:26,501 --> 00:04:30,870
But Rimuru wishes to coexist with those humans.

72
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:35,286
Yes, perhaps he is trying to follow the rules of human.

73
00:04:35,311 --> 00:04:37,343
He appears to be really calm.

74
00:04:37,374 --> 00:04:42,231
But inside, his emotion is anything but stable.

75
00:04:42,491 --> 00:04:45,217
I can feel his rage trying to gush out.

76
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:49,635
Let's just hope nothing will hurt Rimuru's heart any further.

77
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:54,877
There is no words to describe it.

78
00:04:54,878 --> 00:04:55,928
Yes.

79
00:04:55,953 --> 00:05:01,684
I've only known Shion through Rimuru, but I do feel a bit attached to her.

80
00:05:01,812 --> 00:05:06,179
I respect her, as there are stuff to be learned from her.

81
00:05:06,302 --> 00:05:08,194
But now she...

82
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:13,420
It is hard for me to see Rimuru being sad like this.

83
00:05:13,767 --> 00:05:16,771
But a monster's death is nothing to be mourned for.

84
00:05:16,796 --> 00:05:19,395
Their soul will simply return to the cycle of life and death,

85
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:23,030
allowing them to eventually reach an even higher height.

86
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:25,772
That's what the law of nature is all about.

87
00:05:25,797 --> 00:05:27,925
Yes, that is correct.

88
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:31,206
Then why don't he just accept it and move on?

89
00:05:31,276 --> 00:05:33,836
Why would he feel this sad?

90
00:05:33,861 --> 00:05:36,623
Don't you feel lonely, Lord Veldora?

91
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:43,385
You can no longer meet Ms. Shion, and her bright, pure, respectable personality.

92
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:49,349
I suppose the stronger their bond is, the sadder he feels for her lost.

93
00:05:49,644 --> 00:05:53,168
It is just recently that I realized that.

94
00:05:53,193 --> 00:05:54,770
I see.

95
00:05:54,929 --> 00:05:58,315
I might be averting my eyes from Shion

96
00:05:58,316 --> 00:06:01,892
by accepting her death as part of the law of nature.

97
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:08,148
I once killed this girl named Pirina who was friends with Shizu.

98
00:06:08,593 --> 00:06:11,273
At the time, my ego still haven't been fully developed,

99
00:06:11,298 --> 00:06:14,877
and I was merely reacting to any hostility I detect.

100
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:19,001
Even so, that is still the sin that I committed.

101
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:20,754
And that was the main factor

102
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:24,696
on why Shizu and I was unable to be fully connected.

103
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,241
Ifrit...

104
00:06:27,888 --> 00:06:29,680
It's already too late.

105
00:06:29,681 --> 00:06:33,225
I also accepted death merely as part of the law of nature,

106
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:35,442
so I wasn't able to notice Shizu's pain.

107
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:38,731
Shizu thought what I did was her fault,

108
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:41,597
and tormented her heart as a result.

109
00:06:41,935 --> 00:06:45,181
If I hadn't observed Lord Rimuru alongside you,

110
00:06:45,206 --> 00:06:48,272
I wouldn't be able to understand that no matter how long it takes.

111
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:53,689
Death is not something to be taken lightly.

112
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:55,691
A-Actually!

113
00:06:55,716 --> 00:06:57,155
The chance might be slim.

114
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:59,827
No, there might not even be a chance.

115
00:06:59,929 --> 00:07:03,767
But there is a fairytale about resurrecting someone from the dead!

116
00:07:04,218 --> 00:07:07,422
-Lord Veldora! -Resurrect the dead?!

117
00:07:07,578 --> 00:07:10,755
If such a thing does exist...

118
00:07:10,989 --> 00:07:13,993
A story about a certain girl and a dragon.

119
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:18,897
Her parents were a dragon and a human, and she was raised as the Dragon Princess.

120
00:07:19,444 --> 00:07:24,568
One day, her dragon father made a small copy of himself

121
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:26,528
and gave it to his daughter to be her friend.

122
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:30,303
This story... and this Dragon Princess...

123
00:07:30,328 --> 00:07:32,864
Yes, it's about Milim.

124
00:07:33,099 --> 00:07:35,366
I don't really know much, but...

125
00:07:35,424 --> 00:07:39,710
If this barrier is also keeping the souls of the dead inside...

126
00:07:39,826 --> 00:07:42,734
The probability for that is 3.14%.

127
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:46,510
The success rate for resurrection is 3.14%.

128
00:07:46,606 --> 00:07:48,147
That's good enough.

129
00:07:48,202 --> 00:07:51,866
Look, seems like Rimuru also thinks the same way.

130
00:07:51,891 --> 00:07:54,171
He's all fired up.

131
00:07:54,304 --> 00:07:57,291
Yes, he's all prepared.

132
00:07:57,316 --> 00:07:58,472
Yeah.

133
00:07:58,497 --> 00:08:01,188
He's prepared to take over 100,000 human life,

134
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:05,585
shoulder the weight of that sin, and become a True Demon Lord.

135
00:08:06,883 --> 00:08:08,143
Rimuru.

136
00:08:08,254 --> 00:08:09,956
Rest assured.

137
00:08:10,139 --> 00:08:12,508
You're not alone.

138
00:08:12,751 --> 00:08:16,302
I will shoulder that sin alongside you.

139
00:08:17,354 --> 00:08:19,724
So they're the ones who killed Shion and others...

140
00:08:20,722 --> 00:08:22,224
Well then.

141
00:08:23,231 --> 00:08:24,646
Let's start.

142
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:28,231
Their counterattack finally begins.

143
00:08:28,256 --> 00:08:33,274
Yes, and the air is trembling as if it's responding to Rimuru's anger.

144
00:08:33,534 --> 00:08:36,616
The anger of Rimuru's friends is also tremendous.

145
00:08:36,972 --> 00:08:39,018
Even those who are usually calm

146
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:41,885
looks like a completely different person now.

147
00:08:42,336 --> 00:08:45,156
But still, I can't believe Rimuru said;

148
00:08:45,181 --> 00:08:48,235
"If I ended up becoming a mindless monster,

149
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:51,757
take command of everyone left who can fight and dispose me immediately."

150
00:08:51,782 --> 00:08:53,789
to Beminaru before the fight.

151
00:08:53,992 --> 00:08:56,552
What a cruel thing to ask, don't you think?

152
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:58,821
If I were him, I wouldn't accept that.

153
00:08:58,864 --> 00:09:03,876
True. It might be possible in the past, but not the case now.

154
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:07,475
I don't have what it takes to command other monsters to begin with.

155
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:10,192
And stopping Lord Rimuru would be impossible.

156
00:09:10,217 --> 00:09:12,067
That's part of the reason.

157
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:15,223
I'm sure Rimuru is not the type to make an unreasonable request,

158
00:09:15,248 --> 00:09:17,970
so that just means how much he believes and relies on Benimaru.

159
00:09:18,413 --> 00:09:20,687
I do feel a little bit jealous.

160
00:09:21,503 --> 00:09:26,191
Well, I'm sure Rimuru won't do anything that would make his friend sad.

161
00:09:26,216 --> 00:09:29,611
He will surely succeed in becoming a Demon Lord.

162
00:09:29,636 --> 00:09:31,972
You're right. Let's believe in him.

163
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:34,993
Ah, Lord Veldora. Look.

164
00:09:35,071 --> 00:09:36,408
Die.

165
00:09:36,755 --> 00:09:39,107
May the wrath of the gods sear through your very souls.

166
00:09:39,645 --> 00:09:41,121
Megiddo!

167
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:45,218
That gentle Rimuru...

168
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:48,560
Although he had always hated to hurt other people,

169
00:09:48,743 --> 00:09:52,406
he's killing enemy forces without showing any hesitation.

170
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:55,302
He chooses the most optimal method to kill

171
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:58,514
and put it into action without hesitation.

172
00:09:58,515 --> 00:10:02,640
To be honest, one can't help but to feel dread seeing his resolve.

173
00:10:02,665 --> 00:10:03,850
Yes.

174
00:10:04,454 --> 00:10:08,170
The calm one is always the scariest when angry.

175
00:10:08,447 --> 00:10:11,677
There's a lot of depiction of that in the scriptures.

176
00:10:11,971 --> 00:10:16,919
He's also surprisingly calm for not killing Edmaris the king of Falmuth.

177
00:10:17,883 --> 00:10:20,369
If I were him, I would never bother to do such a thing.

178
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:23,248
I will just kill them all.

179
00:10:23,517 --> 00:10:25,374
However, if you think about it,

180
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:28,919
that will make it harder to clean after the mess.

181
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:32,561
Even Falmuth won't stay put if their king is killed,

182
00:10:32,586 --> 00:10:35,844
and I'm sure they will move their entire army response.

183
00:10:36,147 --> 00:10:39,179
And the Western Holy Church won't simply stay put either.

184
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:42,452
Considering the goal is to avoid any further conflict,

185
00:10:42,477 --> 00:10:45,353
then what Lord Rimuru did might be for the best.

186
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:48,105
It's a hard issue.

187
00:10:48,106 --> 00:10:50,149
However, the fact that he wouldn't kill the king

188
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:52,362
doesn't mean he will show any mercy.

189
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:56,559
If it were me, I would just kill him right there.

190
00:10:56,584 --> 00:10:58,881
Rimuru really did great holding back.

191
00:10:58,906 --> 00:11:01,381
What an incredible mental strength.

192
00:11:01,406 --> 00:11:04,177
However, I suppose it really is the best option.

193
00:11:07,336 --> 00:11:09,906
Nn? He's finally evolving.

194
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:11,998
Rimuru is acting weird.

195
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:14,246
He looks like dozing off.

196
00:11:15,258 --> 00:11:18,217
I've never experienced it, so I don't know first hand.

197
00:11:18,242 --> 00:11:22,077
But I'm sure evolving into a Demon Lord is a tiring ordeal.

198
00:11:25,268 --> 00:11:28,283
Nnn?! That guy... he must be an Archdemon.

199
00:11:28,308 --> 00:11:30,227
-Eh?! -I'm sure of it.

200
00:11:30,279 --> 00:11:33,663
Not to mention, it's not just some ordinary guy who was just born.

201
00:11:33,688 --> 00:11:36,877
But a very dangerous one who has lived for so many years.

202
00:11:36,902 --> 00:11:38,291
No way?!

203
00:11:38,316 --> 00:11:43,126
Ifrit, as a high-level spirit who have advantages against demons,

204
00:11:43,151 --> 00:11:45,557
can you tell how much is his strength?

205
00:11:45,722 --> 00:11:50,375
Yes, but he looks like just ordinary Greater Demon in my eyes.

206
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:55,839
That means he has fully mastered Mimic to conceal his identity.

207
00:11:55,840 --> 00:12:00,010
On top of that, he's an oddball who comes even though no one calls him.

208
00:12:00,011 --> 00:12:03,889
There's a chance that he might have lived longer than me.

209
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:06,269
No, it can't be.

210
00:12:13,708 --> 00:12:14,880
I'm bored.

211
00:12:15,618 --> 00:12:16,985
Bored?

212
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:20,453
Lord Veldora, we're at the most intense situation right now.

213
00:12:20,478 --> 00:12:22,310
Don't you have any other thing to say?

214
00:12:22,335 --> 00:12:24,897
But I'm just telling the truth.

215
00:12:24,922 --> 00:12:27,412
Now that Rimuru has fallen asleep for his evolution,

216
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:30,045
we can't even see what's happening outside.

217
00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:32,536
There just nothing to do, it's boring.

218
00:12:32,866 --> 00:12:36,008
But well, just playing around won't do any good.

219
00:12:36,078 --> 00:12:39,141
I'm sure it'll be busy once Rimuru becomes a Demon Lord.

220
00:12:39,166 --> 00:12:44,168
I must hurry up and get myself out of this Unlimited Imprisonment to help him.

221
00:12:44,394 --> 00:12:47,111
I'll go back analyzing the Unlimited Imprisonment now.

222
00:12:47,136 --> 00:12:48,805
Good luck!

223
00:12:50,835 --> 00:12:53,126
-Nnn? -What's wrong?

224
00:12:53,317 --> 00:12:55,687
-This is weird. -Lord Veldora?

225
00:12:55,712 --> 00:12:58,421
My analyzing speed increased tremendously.

226
00:12:58,446 --> 00:13:01,312
Or more like, I feel stronger.

227
00:13:01,451 --> 00:13:05,392
More than double, it's dozen... hundred times faster!

228
00:13:05,417 --> 00:13:09,316
No, my analyzing speed has now become hundreds of times faster!

229
00:13:09,341 --> 00:13:10,487
I'm so amazing!

230
00:13:10,512 --> 00:13:12,666
As I expect from you, Lord Veldora!

231
00:13:12,667 --> 00:13:15,683
Unlimited Imprisonment is a piece of cake when you put your mind to it!

232
00:13:15,708 --> 00:13:17,141
Wait wait wait!

233
00:13:17,166 --> 00:13:20,353
Not even I would be that conceited.

234
00:13:20,378 --> 00:13:22,314
That is just impossible.

235
00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:25,144
There's no way I would become stronger without any reason.

236
00:13:25,344 --> 00:13:28,443
By the way, how much stronger do you feel right now?

237
00:13:28,468 --> 00:13:32,783
It's still increasing, but around 345 times stronger, I guess?

238
00:13:32,808 --> 00:13:33,868
What?!

239
00:13:33,893 --> 00:13:36,143
Well, I knew you would say that.

240
00:13:36,168 --> 00:13:37,691
I mean, it's weird!

241
00:13:37,692 --> 00:13:39,910
No matter how you think about it, it's strange!

242
00:13:39,935 --> 00:13:42,757
Ermm... did you eat anything weird lately?

243
00:13:42,782 --> 00:13:44,650
You ate something from the ground, didn't you?

244
00:13:44,675 --> 00:13:46,412
Cut that out!

245
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:49,202
I'm sorry, I was shocked.

246
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:53,415
By the way, Lord Veldora, why are you so calm about this?

247
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:55,873
Well, because it's better this way.

248
00:13:55,898 --> 00:13:57,753
If things continue like this,

249
00:13:57,754 --> 00:14:00,923
I will get out of this place in no time!

250
00:14:02,584 --> 00:14:05,218
Well, that's true.

251
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:07,766
So do you have any idea on why that is happening?

252
00:14:07,818 --> 00:14:09,719
I do have one.

253
00:14:09,814 --> 00:14:13,310
It seems that Rimuru's analyzing speed also increased.

254
00:14:13,311 --> 00:14:14,788
Here's my guess.

255
00:14:14,813 --> 00:14:17,327
In the process of transforming into a Demon Lord,

256
00:14:17,352 --> 00:14:21,196
the computing ability of Rimuru's skill has improved.

257
00:14:21,315 --> 00:14:25,672
And at the same time, it also improves your skill?

258
00:14:26,032 --> 00:14:28,487
-Then that's great. -Nnn?

259
00:14:28,512 --> 00:14:30,452
-Well, your life. -My life?!

260
00:14:30,453 --> 00:14:31,745
I was a little worried,

261
00:14:31,746 --> 00:14:35,613
thinking that the boost was simply the last glimmer of your life.

262
00:14:35,638 --> 00:14:38,752
That is impossible! Hahaha!

263
00:14:38,753 --> 00:14:40,526
No way, right?

264
00:14:40,839 --> 00:14:42,766
Don't scare me like that.

265
00:14:44,485 --> 00:14:47,219
Lord Veldora! Look at that!

266
00:14:48,695 --> 00:14:52,028
Seems like Rimuru's evolution into a Demon Lord is finally over.

267
00:14:53,564 --> 00:14:54,676
What's that?

268
00:14:54,701 --> 00:14:56,103
Must be "Gift."

269
00:14:56,104 --> 00:14:57,521
When you evolve into a Demon Lord,

270
00:14:57,522 --> 00:15:03,401
a Gift will be distributed to all monsters within your genealogy.

271
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:04,997
I see.

272
00:15:09,424 --> 00:15:11,221
L-Lord Veldora!

273
00:15:11,246 --> 00:15:13,738
Why? How did this happen?

274
00:15:13,851 --> 00:15:19,137
Lord Veldora, this person whom we thought were Lord Rimuru... could it be...?

275
00:15:19,181 --> 00:15:21,837
-I noticed from the start, though. -Eh?

276
00:15:21,862 --> 00:15:26,246
I already realized that Rimuru's skill was special from the start.

277
00:15:26,271 --> 00:15:28,729
Yes, that it is an independent type.

278
00:15:28,754 --> 00:15:33,703
As I expect from you, Lord Veldora... or so you think I will say?!

279
00:15:33,728 --> 00:15:37,394
Up until now, you've always been smug when you explain stuff to me.

280
00:15:37,395 --> 00:15:40,327
Ifrit, Shion and orders are waking up!

281
00:15:40,352 --> 00:15:41,837
However...

282
00:15:48,156 --> 00:15:50,283
L-Lord Raphael?!

283
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:57,254
My instinct is telling me that I must not oppose this thing.

284
00:15:58,416 --> 00:16:00,876
May I ask what business do you need from us today?

285
00:16:00,877 --> 00:16:05,709
No matter what it is, I, Ifrit, shall obey your every command!

286
00:16:05,882 --> 00:16:10,552
Yes. The species Ifrit has no name and a weak ego.

287
00:16:10,553 --> 00:16:13,972
Therefore, you do not possess sufficient foundation to obtain a skill.

288
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:16,224
I recommend you to resume your training.

289
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:17,385
Roger!

290
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:21,004
I, Ifrit, shall now begin my training!

291
00:16:21,673 --> 00:16:24,025
One, two, three, four, five!

292
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:25,150
Ummm...

293
00:16:25,151 --> 00:16:26,068
Report.

294
00:16:26,069 --> 00:16:29,697
I am convinced that the individual Veldora has been slacking off too much.

295
00:16:30,615 --> 00:16:31,593
Order.

296
00:16:31,617 --> 00:16:34,576
Acquire Ultimate skill immediately.

297
00:16:34,577 --> 00:16:36,745
But that's kind of impossible...

298
00:16:36,746 --> 00:16:38,538
Report. It's possible.

299
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:41,917
I've expanded this computing space by force.

300
00:16:41,918 --> 00:16:44,353
You shall maintain this space by yourself

301
00:16:44,377 --> 00:16:47,385
while continuing your work analyzing the Unlimited Imprisonment.

302
00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:52,852
She didn't ask whether I can do it or not, so that means it's an order.

303
00:16:57,058 --> 00:16:59,059
We must do it, I guess.

304
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:00,102
Yes!

305
00:17:01,646 --> 00:17:05,023
I did my best and finally acquire one!

306
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:07,767
My Ultimate skill, Faust!

307
00:17:07,827 --> 00:17:12,155
It's thanks to this Gift from Rimuru, I must thank him later.

308
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:15,033
Now Lord Raphael won't be yelling at us.

309
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:16,451
Yeah.

310
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:19,833
And also, Ifrit, you got a lot more muscular, aren't you?

311
00:17:19,858 --> 00:17:22,386
No, I still have more to go.

312
00:17:22,411 --> 00:17:26,709
I will train harder and lower my body fat percentage to 10%!

313
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:29,050
I see. Well, do your best.

314
00:17:29,966 --> 00:17:31,007
Question.

315
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:33,635
Have you acquired an Ultimate Skill?

316
00:17:33,636 --> 00:17:35,189
Yes of course!

317
00:17:35,214 --> 00:17:36,274
Good.

318
00:17:36,299 --> 00:17:39,725
Well then, let's break this Unlimited Imprisonment right away.

319
00:17:40,848 --> 00:17:44,823
Now you can finally get out! Congratulation, Lord Veldora!

320
00:17:44,848 --> 00:17:48,105
It's still too early to celebrate, though. Hahaha!

321
00:17:48,461 --> 00:17:51,508
What should I talk about with Rimuru after I break free?

322
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:53,446
I'll start with a boast!

323
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:57,450
For that, I will pretend that I don't know anything that happened outside.

324
00:17:57,451 --> 00:17:59,870
That sounds good.

325
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:05,166
Maybe I can pretend to acquire Faust in front of him.

326
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:09,017
"O-Oooh! So this is what my evolved skill is like?!"

327
00:18:09,042 --> 00:18:14,092
"My Unique Skill Inquirer have became Ultimate Skill Faust!"

328
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:18,972
"It is a power that embodies my restless pursuit of knowledge!"

329
00:18:18,973 --> 00:18:20,507
That's what I'll say.

330
00:18:20,532 --> 00:18:21,850
"That's amazing, Veldora!"

331
00:18:21,851 --> 00:18:24,700
"You just got an Ultimate Skill so easily!"

332
00:18:24,725 --> 00:18:27,105
"As I thought, you're an incredible dude!"

333
00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:31,192
Like that, Rimuru will surely complement me from the bottom of his heart.

334
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:34,029
After that, I will say this to him.

335
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:36,237
"It's no big deal."

336
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:43,788
Ummm, Lord Veldora, if I may...

337
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:47,513
If you're going to go outside and stand as Lord Rimuru's friend,

338
00:18:47,538 --> 00:18:52,005
Lord Rimuru will have to take responsibility for your action.

339
00:18:52,006 --> 00:18:54,382
Please remember that.

340
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:57,591
People have this thing called "Unwelcome favor."

341
00:18:57,616 --> 00:19:02,859
It means things that you do out of goodwill can still be an annoyance for others.

342
00:19:03,137 --> 00:19:05,602
And for someone as powerful as you,

343
00:19:05,603 --> 00:19:09,356
I believe it's better if you first consult with others before you start.

344
00:19:09,357 --> 00:19:10,751
I see.

345
00:19:11,132 --> 00:19:14,819
Understand? You don't want Lord Rimuru to hate you, don't you?

346
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,279
I'll cry.

347
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,490
As such, you need to be cautious,

348
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:22,183
careful, thoughtful, and think about others.

349
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:23,511
It's a promise.

350
00:19:23,536 --> 00:19:25,360
Yes, I understand.

351
00:19:25,385 --> 00:19:28,208
And Ifrit, I will promise you this.

352
00:19:28,209 --> 00:19:29,793
Promise?

353
00:19:29,794 --> 00:19:34,881
I promise that someday I will free you from that place.

354
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:39,353
R-Really?! I will eagerly wait for that day to come!

355
00:19:39,378 --> 00:19:41,314
Rest assured, Ifrit.

356
00:19:41,339 --> 00:19:45,725
Like Rimuru, I'm the type who always keeps his promise.

357
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:51,481
And I'm sure it won't take long until I fulfill our promise.

358
00:19:51,482 --> 00:19:53,650
I'll be looking forward to be with you again.

359
00:19:53,675 --> 00:19:55,443
Yes, of course!

360
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:58,381
When that time comes, please have another shogi match with me.

361
00:19:58,406 --> 00:19:59,987
I won't hold back.

362
00:20:00,012 --> 00:20:01,742
Just as I want it!

363
00:20:11,335 --> 00:20:14,093
This place sure takes me back.

364
00:20:18,563 --> 00:20:20,525
It has been two years since then.

365
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:21,705
Report.

366
00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:24,855
Analysis and Assessment of Unlimited Imprisonment is complete.

367
00:20:25,004 --> 00:20:27,200
I can finally fulfill my promise.

368
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:28,928
I will free you now.

369
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:30,612
Veldora!

370
00:20:34,396 --> 00:20:37,235
I grew taller?!

371
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:41,614
Raphael, make a Body Double of me.

372
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:43,658
I'll make it as the vessel for Veldora.

373
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:45,516
Enhanced Replication activate.

374
00:20:51,167 --> 00:20:54,049
My body did grew a bit.

375
00:20:57,590 --> 00:21:01,167
It's supposed to be me, but man, I look beautiful.

376
00:21:04,162 --> 00:21:05,664
Okay, let's do this.

377
00:21:28,216 --> 00:21:29,900
Please work.

378
00:21:32,215 --> 00:21:33,215
Report.

379
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:37,777
The soul corridor between Master and the individual Veldora has been established.

380
00:21:56,254 --> 00:22:01,635
I, the Storm Dragon Veldora Tempest, have returned!

381
00:22:02,229 --> 00:22:06,089
Anyone who opposes me will die!

382
00:22:19,144 --> 00:22:22,522
I'm used to losing things

383
00:22:22,523 --> 00:22:27,194
I said it like it's someone else's problem

384
00:22:27,903 --> 00:22:31,072
It's a blurry realism

385
00:22:31,073 --> 00:22:36,119
Because it's not about me

386
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:41,207
The nameless sadness disappears, warped in a legato-like dream

387
00:22:41,208 --> 00:22:45,378
Will we feel better if we hug each other?

388
00:22:45,379 --> 00:22:49,632
The life which I repeat is a joined miracle

389
00:22:49,633 --> 00:22:54,179
Don't forget me, pass your voice to me

390
00:22:58,058 --> 00:23:01,811
If I were to live for someone's sake

391
00:23:01,812 --> 00:23:06,107
I wish that someone is you (I'll tell you one more story)

392
00:23:06,108 --> 00:23:10,445
If I can redo this world once again

393
00:23:10,446 --> 00:23:15,825
I will paint that story with love

394
00:23:15,826 --> 00:23:20,079
You'll know how this story's gonna end

395
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,998
I will tell you

396
00:23:21,999 --> 00:23:24,375
I will tell you one more story

397
00:23:24,376 --> 00:23:28,671
You'll know how this story's gonna end

398
00:23:28,672 --> 00:23:30,883
I will tell you
