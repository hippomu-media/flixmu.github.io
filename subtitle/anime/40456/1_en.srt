1
00:00:58.292 --> 00:00:59.583
Kenichi.

2
00:01:00.208 --> 00:01:01.458
Hideki.

3
00:01:02.292 --> 00:01:03.542
Minoru.

4
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:05.750
Masao.

5
00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:07.750
Susumu.

6
00:01:08.333 --> 00:01:09.875
Yuuta.

7
00:01:10.875 --> 00:01:12.791
Yaichi.

8
00:01:12.792 --> 00:01:14.874
Toyoaki.

9
00:01:14.875 --> 00:01:16.625
Isao.

10
00:01:16.667 --> 00:01:18.667
Ryosuke.

11
00:01:18.708 --> 00:01:20.707
Yukio.

12
00:01:20.708 --> 00:01:22.125
Takahiro.

13
00:01:33.583 --> 00:01:39.042
Oyakata-sama, itâ€™s about time. Your health will deteriorate otherwise.

14
00:01:41.583 --> 00:01:46.000
I wonder when I may visit this place again.

15
00:01:53.042 --> 00:01:59.375
I wish to appease the grievances of the deceased children.

16
00:02:02.083 --> 00:02:09.500
Early this month, I received seven reports regarding the demonâ€™s attacks.

17
00:02:14.333 --> 00:02:16.375
Even at this moment,

18
00:02:17.417 --> 00:02:21.833
the children of the Demon Slayer Corps are battling demons at the frontline.

19
00:02:25.667 --> 00:02:28.583
No matter how many lives the demon robs,

20
00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.917
the one thing that cannot be severed is the people's emotions.

21
00:02:37.208 --> 00:02:39.417
No matter how overwhelmed they are,

22
00:02:40.583 --> 00:02:44.458
people will always stand up and fight back.

23
00:03:33.208 --> 00:03:35.750
For the time being, let us hide our swords on our backs.

24
00:03:36.333 --> 00:03:38.333
Oh no, it's leaving!

25
00:03:40.542 --> 00:03:41.750
Are there any police?

26
00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:43.833
Even if there are, we have to depart.

27
00:03:46.458 --> 00:03:47.499
Itâ€™s a duel!

28
00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:48.999
Master of the land!

29
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.042
Idiot!

30
00:03:50.583 --> 00:03:51.625
Letâ€™s get going.

31
00:03:53.125 --> 00:03:55.042
Wait for me!

32
00:03:58.292 --> 00:03:59.750
W-Wait!

33
00:04:01.375 --> 00:04:03.625
Tanjiro! Inosuke!

34
00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:04.958
Zenitsu!

35
00:04:20.708 --> 00:04:22.499
How fast!

36
00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.167
Sorry, sorry!

37
00:04:24.208 --> 00:04:26.458
Stop it already and come here, idiot!

38
00:04:26.667 --> 00:04:27.833
It's so fast!

39
00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.875
Grandma, will this do?

40
00:04:37.292 --> 00:04:38.583
Thank you.

41
00:04:38.667 --> 00:04:40.457
Sorry to trouble you.

42
00:04:40.458 --> 00:04:41.333
Not at all.

43
00:04:41.334 --> 00:04:43.167
It is a simple matter.

44
00:04:53.917 --> 00:04:55.249
He's what they call a Hashira, right?

45
00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:56.958
That Rengoku.

46
00:04:57.958 --> 00:04:59.667
Do you recognise his face, at least?

47
00:05:00.625 --> 00:05:05.333
Yes. He has a flashy hairdo and I remember his scent too.

48
00:05:07.125 --> 00:05:08.750
I think Iâ€™ll know once we get closer.

49
00:05:10.792 --> 00:05:11.875
Delicious!

50
00:05:32.875 --> 00:05:42.792
Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba the Movie - Mugen Train.

51
00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:45.625
Delicious!

52
00:05:46.333 --> 00:05:47.333
Delicious.

53
00:05:48.292 --> 00:05:49.292
Delicious.

54
00:05:51.917 --> 00:05:52.917
Delicious!

55
00:05:54.708 --> 00:05:55.708
Delicious!

56
00:05:58.083 --> 00:06:00.083
Delicious!

57
00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:02.000
Delicious!

58
00:06:03.542 --> 00:06:04.542
Delicious!

59
00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:06.958
Delicious!

60
00:06:08.917 --> 00:06:09.917
Delicious!

61
00:06:12.208 --> 00:06:13.208
Delicious!

62
00:06:13.708 --> 00:06:15.416
This guy is the Flame Hashira?

63
00:06:15.417 --> 00:06:15.875
Delicious!

64
00:06:15.875 --> 00:06:16.875
Yes.

65
00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:18.499
Isnâ€™t he just a glutton?

66
00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:18.875
Tasty! Isn't he just a glutton?

67
00:06:18.875 --> 00:06:18.958
Delicious!

68
00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.000
Yeah.

69
00:06:20.417 --> 00:06:21.458
Delicious!

70
00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:23.417
Excuse me.

71
00:06:24.792 --> 00:06:25.500
Delicious!

72
00:06:25.542 --> 00:06:27.292
Ren-Rengoku?

73
00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.083
Delicious!

74
00:06:29.708 --> 00:06:31.292
Well, that isâ€¦

75
00:06:31.333 --> 00:06:33.000
I get it already.

76
00:06:33.542 --> 00:06:35.000
Ahâ€¦

77
00:06:40.417 --> 00:06:42.875
So, it was you at Oyakata-samaâ€™sâ€¦

78
00:06:43.375 --> 00:06:45.792
Yes, Iâ€™m Tanjiro Kamado.

79
00:06:46.417 --> 00:06:48.125
These two are my fellow Demon Slayer Corps members:

80
00:06:48.167 --> 00:06:51.042
Zenitsu Agatsuma and Inosuke Hashibira.

81
00:06:52.167 --> 00:06:55.833
I see. So, the one in that box, isâ€¦

82
00:06:56.333 --> 00:06:57.167
Yes.

83
00:06:57.168 --> 00:06:59.167
My sister, Nezuko.

84
00:06:59.917 --> 00:07:02.417
Right. The demon back then.

85
00:07:02.917 --> 00:07:06.792
About what Oyakata-sama approved of, I won't bring up for now.

86
00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:12.292
You may sit here.

87
00:07:19.667 --> 00:07:22.249
Amazing. It's amazing inside!

88
00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:25.792
The glass will break! Calm down!

89
00:07:26.292 --> 00:07:30.042
Why are you guys here? A mission?

90
00:07:30.792 --> 00:07:33.125
There was a transmission via Kasugai Crow.

91
00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:35.417
Apparently, the Mugen Train damage has worsened.

92
00:07:35.875 --> 00:07:37.166
My orders were to join you,

93
00:07:37.167 --> 00:07:39.167
Rengoku, at the location itself.

94
00:07:39.833 --> 00:07:42.917
Yes, I acknowledge that!

95
00:07:43.083 --> 00:07:44.083
Yes.

96
00:07:45.083 --> 00:07:47.000
There is one more thing.

97
00:07:48.208 --> 00:07:50.167
I want to ask you something, Rengoku.

98
00:07:51.333 --> 00:07:53.250
What? Just say it.

99
00:07:54.042 --> 00:07:56.208
Itâ€™s about my father.

100
00:07:56.375 --> 00:07:58.042
What happened to your father?

101
00:07:59.208 --> 00:08:00.667
He was ill.

102
00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:01.958
Ill?

103
00:08:02.792 --> 00:08:07.208
But even when he was freezing, he danced Kagura in the snow.

104
00:08:07.333 --> 00:08:08.708
That's good to hear!

105
00:08:11.167 --> 00:08:11.750
About that!

106
00:08:11.751 --> 00:08:12.833
What is it?

107
00:08:13.667 --> 00:08:16.708
Hinokami Kagura Dance.

108
00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:21.417
Itâ€™s a Kagura I saw once when I was kid.

109
00:08:22.250 --> 00:08:24.958
Perhaps, if you know anything about it,

110
00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:27.708
please tell me more.

111
00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:34.500
Sure!

112
00:08:35.542 --> 00:08:36.542
But I haven't a clue!

113
00:08:36.542 --> 00:08:37.542
Huh?

114
00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.833
This is the first time I am hearing about Hinokami Kagura.

115
00:08:41.542 --> 00:08:44.957
You were able to apply Kagura that your father performed in battle.

116
00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:46.708
I congratulate you on that.

117
00:08:47.083 --> 00:08:48.750
This conversation is over!

118
00:08:49.083 --> 00:08:51.249
Wait, just a while more!

119
00:08:51.250 --> 00:08:53.499
You should become my Tsuguko.

120
00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:54.916
Iâ€™ll look after you!

121
00:08:54.917 --> 00:08:58.375
Please wait. And what are you looking at?!

122
00:08:59.708 --> 00:09:01.500
What a weird guy.

123
00:09:01.667 --> 00:09:03.667
Flame Breathing has a long history in itself.

124
00:09:04.625 --> 00:09:09.125
Swordsmen from any era who have mastered flame and water became Hashira without a doubt.

125
00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:16.582
Flame, Water, Wind, Stone, Thunder.

126
00:09:16.583 --> 00:09:18.208
Those are the basics of Breathing Styles.

127
00:09:19.333 --> 00:09:22.833
Other breathing styles merely branched out from those.

128
00:09:23.625 --> 00:09:25.708
Mist is derived from wind.

129
00:09:26.875 --> 00:09:29.875
Mizoguchi boy, what colour is your sword?

130
00:09:31.125 --> 00:09:34.375
My name is Kamado. The colour is black.

131
00:09:34.625 --> 00:09:37.333
A black sword! Thatâ€™s a tough one!

132
00:09:39.292 --> 00:09:40.667
Is it?

133
00:09:41.208 --> 00:09:44.375
I have never seen a swordsman with a black sword become a Hashira!

134
00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:48.500
Furthermore, I heard that you donâ€™t know what system you should master.

135
00:09:50.625 --> 00:09:54.542
Iâ€™ll train you at my place. Don't worry!

136
00:09:54.833 --> 00:09:58.292
No! No! And what are you looking at?!

137
00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:00.958
Phew.

138
00:10:05.917 --> 00:10:08.917
Heâ€™s weird but a kind and caring person.

139
00:10:09.917 --> 00:10:12.500
Even his scent gives off a strong sense of justice.

140
00:10:15.833 --> 00:10:18.667
It's amazing! So fast!

141
00:10:19.625 --> 00:10:22.124
Itâ€™s dangerous, you idiot!

142
00:10:22.125 --> 00:10:23.624
I will go out and run!

143
00:10:23.625 --> 00:10:25.625
It shall be a battle to decide who is faster!

144
00:10:26.208 --> 00:10:28.249
Even idiots have their limits!

145
00:10:28.250 --> 00:10:29.250
It's not safe.

146
00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.042
We donâ€™t know when the demon will appear.

147
00:10:33.042 --> 00:10:34.042
What?

148
00:10:36.292 --> 00:10:39.042
Youâ€™re kidding, right? Will a demon appear in this train?!

149
00:10:40.083 --> 00:10:40.667
Yes, it will!

150
00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:42.207
Will it appear?

151
00:10:42.208 --> 00:10:43.624
I donâ€™t want that!

152
00:10:43.625 --> 00:10:47.041
We're not going to the demon but it will appear here?

153
00:10:47.042 --> 00:10:50.625
No! Iâ€™m getting off!

154
00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:55.750
More than forty people went missing from this train in a short period of time.

155
00:10:56.167 --> 00:10:58.166
We sent several swordsmen,

156
00:10:58.167 --> 00:10:59.625
but everyone disappeared.

157
00:11:00.333 --> 00:11:02.833
That is why I came here as a Hashira.

158
00:11:05.167 --> 00:11:08.750
What?!

159
00:11:09.167 --> 00:11:11.291
I see! I'm getting off!

160
00:11:11.292 --> 00:11:13.292
Iâ€™m getting off!

161
00:11:21.375 --> 00:11:25.792
I needâ€¦ to seeâ€¦ your tickets.

162
00:11:27.292 --> 00:11:28.292
Huh?

163
00:11:28.958 --> 00:11:32.625
The conductor checks our tickets and makes a notch in them.

164
00:11:44.083 --> 00:11:45.083
Here.

165
00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:12.708
What is it? I smell something nasty.

166
00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.958
I haveâ€¦ checked them.

167
00:12:22.958 --> 00:12:23.958
Mr. Conductor.

168
00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:26.000
Itâ€™s dangerous, so please stand down.

169
00:12:26.542 --> 00:12:30.250
For emergency reasons, I would like you to turn a blind eye to the sword.

170
00:12:50.625 --> 00:12:54.292
Were you hiding your Blood Demon Art behind that giant body?

171
00:12:54.958 --> 00:12:56.708
It's also tough to detect your presence.

172
00:12:58.458 --> 00:13:02.333
However, if you bare your fangs at innocent people,

173
00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:09.375
my bright red flame sword will burn you to the bone!

174
00:13:14.875 --> 00:13:16.333
Flame Breathing.

175
00:13:17.083 --> 00:13:18.500
First Form.

176
00:13:29.208 --> 00:13:30.625
Unknowing Fire!

177
00:13:40.417 --> 00:13:41.417
Amazing.

178
00:13:41.750 --> 00:13:43.458
He slit the demonâ€™s neck with a single blow.

179
00:13:47.167 --> 00:13:48.708
There is still one more.

180
00:13:49.167 --> 00:13:50.167
Follow me!

181
00:13:50.708 --> 00:13:51.708
What?!

182
00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:53.583
Yeah!

183
00:13:55.042 --> 00:13:57.583
D-Don't leave meâ€¦!

184
00:14:16.917 --> 00:14:19.125
If you lay a finger on him, I'll make you pay!

185
00:14:24.458 --> 00:14:25.833
Didn't you hear me?

186
00:14:26.375 --> 00:14:28.958
I said, your opponent is right here.

187
00:14:29.375 --> 00:14:31.499
What on earth? It's so long!

188
00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:33.749
The hand is so longâ€¦

189
00:14:33.750 --> 00:14:34.916
Oh, yes!

190
00:14:34.917 --> 00:14:36.457
First win!

191
00:14:36.458 --> 00:14:37.042
Wait!

192
00:14:37.043 --> 00:14:39.041
That guy needs to be evacuated first!

193
00:14:39.042 --> 00:14:41.042
I'll take it down, so it's not a problem!

194
00:14:56.542 --> 00:14:59.042
The back carriage is safe. You should go there.

195
00:15:01.083 --> 00:15:04.500
This won't be a problem here. Letâ€™s finish it quickly.

196
00:15:13.208 --> 00:15:14.625
Flame Breathing.

197
00:15:15.125 --> 00:15:16.125
Second Form.

198
00:15:20.542 --> 00:15:21.958
Rising Scorching Sun!

199
00:15:42.875 --> 00:15:45.208
T-That wasâ€¦

200
00:15:45.833 --> 00:15:49.750
â€¦amazing, big brother! What superb swordsmanship!

201
00:15:50.167 --> 00:15:52.582
Please make me your disciple!

202
00:15:52.583 --> 00:15:55.082
Sure thing! Iâ€™ll make you a fine swordsman.

203
00:15:55.083 --> 00:15:57.374
Me too! Me too!

204
00:15:57.375 --> 00:15:59.832
Iâ€™ll look after all of you!!

205
00:15:59.833 --> 00:16:02.832
Big Brother Rengoku!

206
00:16:02.833 --> 00:16:06.416
Big Brother!

207
00:16:06.417 --> 00:16:09.249
Big Brother Rengoku!

208
00:16:09.250 --> 00:16:09.583
Hahahahahaha!

209
00:16:09.584 --> 00:16:11.791
Yaaay!! Hahahahahaha!

210
00:16:11.792 --> 00:16:14.250
Yaaay!!

211
00:16:49.875 --> 00:16:53.208
As you instructed, I cut their tickets and put them to sleep.

212
00:16:53.875 --> 00:16:57.333
Please, put me to sleep quickly too.

213
00:16:57.875 --> 00:17:01.583
Let me see my deceased wife and daughter.

214
00:17:02.875 --> 00:17:06.458
Please, I beg of you!

215
00:17:08.250 --> 00:17:09.917
Sure.

216
00:17:14.333 --> 00:17:16.000
You did well.

217
00:17:19.125 --> 00:17:20.708
Now, sleep.

218
00:17:24.333 --> 00:17:26.875
Have a good dream of meeting your family.

219
00:17:28.667 --> 00:17:29.667
Excuse me.

220
00:17:32.125 --> 00:17:34.500
What about us?

221
00:17:36.167 --> 00:17:39.667
You'll be sleepy after doing this a while longer.

222
00:17:40.375 --> 00:17:42.458
Until then, wait here.

223
00:17:43.167 --> 00:17:49.542
The demon slayers with their sharp senses might awaken due to the demon's presence and blood thirst.

224
00:17:50.167 --> 00:17:52.582
When approaching and binding them,

225
00:17:52.583 --> 00:17:55.333
take care not to touch their bodies.

226
00:17:56.375 --> 00:17:59.333
I canâ€™t move from the train for a while.

227
00:18:00.167 --> 00:18:03.292
Do your best until the preparation is done.

228
00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:07.208
So you may see happy dreams.

229
00:18:07.917 --> 00:18:08.917
Yes.

230
00:19:05.625 --> 00:19:08.250
Whatâ€™s going on? What just happened?!

231
00:19:14.833 --> 00:19:17.375
Calm down, calm down.

232
00:19:19.083 --> 00:19:20.083
I have to calm down.

233
00:19:30.958 --> 00:19:31.958
Oh!

234
00:19:32.125 --> 00:19:33.625
It's Brother.

235
00:19:34.208 --> 00:19:35.750
Brother, welcome back!

236
00:19:36.417 --> 00:19:37.708
Has the charcoal been sold out?

237
00:19:51.833 --> 00:19:52.958
What?

238
00:19:55.625 --> 00:19:56.750
Brother?

239
00:20:09.292 --> 00:20:12.875
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry!

240
00:20:23.333 --> 00:20:28.417
Dying while dreaming is a blessing.

241
00:20:29.375 --> 00:20:32.917
No matter how strong a demon slayer one is, it makes no difference.

242
00:20:33.750 --> 00:20:37.375
The original power of humans is their heart.

243
00:20:37.708 --> 00:20:39.292
Their spirit.

244
00:20:42.083 --> 00:20:45.417
All you have to do is destroy the core of their heart.

245
00:20:46.208 --> 00:20:48.208
An easy kill.

246
00:20:48.750 --> 00:20:51.333
All human hearts are the same.

247
00:20:52.250 --> 00:20:56.667
Because they are fragile and weak, like glasswork.

248
00:21:00.083 --> 00:21:02.667
Is it the arm that should be connected with the rope?

249
00:21:03.667 --> 00:21:06.500
Yes, and donâ€™t forget that we have to be careful.

250
00:21:15.958 --> 00:21:21.083
Breath deeply and slowly as you count.

251
00:21:23.375 --> 00:21:25.792
If you do that, youâ€™ll fall asleep.

252
00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:36.583
One, two, three, four, five, sixâ€¦

253
00:21:42.375 --> 00:21:44.957
And because Brother suddenly started crying,

254
00:21:44.958 --> 00:21:46.375
I was startled.

255
00:21:46.958 --> 00:21:48.500
It's weird.

256
00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:53.625
Well, maybe he's exhausted.

257
00:21:53.667 --> 00:21:56.375
That's exaggerating. Because Iâ€™m fine.

258
00:21:59.958 --> 00:22:02.167
Do you have a fever?

259
00:22:02.958 --> 00:22:06.208
Donâ€™t overdo it. Just rest for today.

260
00:22:07.167 --> 00:22:08.583
Iâ€™m okay.

261
00:22:08.708 --> 00:22:09.958
Really?

262
00:22:11.292 --> 00:22:12.542
Wait!

263
00:22:15.333 --> 00:22:15.625
What are you trying to do?

264
00:22:15.625 --> 00:22:16.500
Hey! What exactly are you up to?

265
00:22:16.501 --> 00:22:17.875
What exactly are you trying to do?

266
00:22:17.917 --> 00:22:20.750
Hey! I said, stop!

267
00:22:22.625 --> 00:22:23.625
Somehow...

268
00:22:24.583 --> 00:22:27.875
It felt like I was having a bad dream.

269
00:22:30.333 --> 00:22:33.958
Go to sleep, effortlessly.

270
00:22:34.583 --> 00:22:37.292
Forget how to breath, effortlessly.

271
00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:40.833
The demon is coming, effortlessly.

272
00:22:41.750 --> 00:22:44.208
Even inside the belly, effortlessly.

273
00:22:46.250 --> 00:22:50.625
It looks fun. They start seeing happy dreams.

274
00:22:54.750 --> 00:22:56.042
Falling.

275
00:22:57.333 --> 00:22:58.667
Theyâ€™re falling.

276
00:22:59.250 --> 00:23:00.667
While inside the dream.

277
00:23:07.500 --> 00:23:09.167
Itâ€™s a deep sleep.

278
00:23:10.750 --> 00:23:11.750
Soâ€¦

279
00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:15.208
You canâ€™t wake up anymore.

280
00:23:24.917 --> 00:23:26.042
Over here!

281
00:23:26.667 --> 00:23:28.417
The peaches here are delicious.

282
00:23:28.708 --> 00:23:30.666
The white clovers are in full bloom too.

283
00:23:30.667 --> 00:23:32.667
Iâ€™ll make a ring with the flowers.

284
00:23:33.250 --> 00:23:35.167
I can do it really well.

285
00:23:35.917 --> 00:23:36.917
Nezuko.

286
00:23:37.250 --> 00:23:39.667
Yes, please make plenty.

287
00:23:40.500 --> 00:23:41.500
Zenitsu.

288
00:23:45.792 --> 00:23:48.292
Hurray!

289
00:23:49.083 --> 00:23:52.167
There's a river up ahead. Itâ€™s shallow so that's fine, right?

290
00:23:52.667 --> 00:23:53.667
A river?

291
00:23:55.708 --> 00:23:57.375
Zenitsu, what should I do?

292
00:23:58.625 --> 00:24:00.417
I canâ€™t swim.

293
00:24:01.875 --> 00:24:04.083
I-I will give you a piggyback ride and jump!

294
00:24:04.458 --> 00:24:05.625
Itâ€™s just a river!

295
00:24:06.083 --> 00:24:08.250
I won't let your toes get wet, Nezuko.

296
00:24:11.833 --> 00:24:13.333
Leave it to me!

297
00:24:14.500 --> 00:24:16.958
Let's go!

298
00:24:31.750 --> 00:24:33.624
Explorers! Explorers!

299
00:24:33.625 --> 00:24:35.374
We are cave explorers!

300
00:24:35.375 --> 00:24:37.499
Explorers! Explorers!

301
00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:40.125
We are cave explorers! Explorers! Explorers!

302
00:24:40.750 --> 00:24:41.750
Boss!

303
00:24:41.875 --> 00:24:42.917
Boss!

304
00:24:43.542 --> 00:24:46.667
Whatâ€™s wrong, Minion 1 and 2?

305
00:24:47.167 --> 00:24:51.292
I smell the master of this cave from over there!

306
00:24:51.958 --> 00:24:54.667
I can also hear its snore!

307
00:24:59.500 --> 00:25:00.875
The master is over there?

308
00:25:01.542 --> 00:25:03.875
Alright, let's go! It's a duel!

309
00:25:04.292 --> 00:25:05.875
Roger that, Boss!

310
00:25:06.417 --> 00:25:09.332
Hey, you! Come here, Minion 3!

311
00:25:09.333 --> 00:25:13.624
Come right on over! Hey! Iâ€™ll give you some shiny acorns later, hey!

312
00:25:13.625 --> 00:25:15.957
Let's go!

313
00:25:15.958 --> 00:25:17.500
Hey!

314
00:25:46.125 --> 00:25:47.625
Huh? Why have I come here?

315
00:25:51.917 --> 00:25:55.000
Thatâ€™s right. I have to report to Father.

316
00:25:56.167 --> 00:25:57.625
That I have become a Hashira.

317
00:26:17.750 --> 00:26:19.667
So what if you have become a Hashira?

318
00:26:24.917 --> 00:26:27.375
It's worthless. It doesn't matter.

319
00:26:28.375 --> 00:26:30.875
We won't amount to much anyway.

320
00:26:32.500 --> 00:26:35.125
Both you and me.

321
00:26:41.375 --> 00:26:43.125
Oh, Brother.

322
00:26:45.292 --> 00:26:47.833
Was Father pleased?

323
00:26:48.917 --> 00:26:54.625
If I too, become a Hashira, would Father also accept it?

324
00:26:57.792 --> 00:26:59.750
He wasnâ€™t like that in the past.

325
00:27:01.042 --> 00:27:04.250
Father became a Hashira in the Demon Slayer Corps.

326
00:27:05.208 --> 00:27:06.667
He was so full of passion back then.

327
00:27:07.792 --> 00:27:11.625
One day, he suddenly stopped being a swordsman.

328
00:27:12.708 --> 00:27:13.708
All of a sudden.

329
00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:19.500
He was a man who raised us with passion.

330
00:27:23.375 --> 00:27:24.375
Yet, why?

331
00:27:27.167 --> 00:27:28.083
Even if I think about it,

332
00:27:28.125 --> 00:27:30.292
I shouldnâ€™t think about something that canâ€™t be helped.

333
00:27:31.625 --> 00:27:34.583
Senjuro is more pitiful.

334
00:27:35.542 --> 00:27:40.417
Because he wasn't old enough, he had nearly no memory of our mother who died of illness.

335
00:27:40.667 --> 00:27:42.167
And Father was already in that state.

336
00:27:48.250 --> 00:27:52.833
To be honest, Father wasnâ€™t pleased.

337
00:27:53.542 --> 00:27:55.083
He said it makes no difference.

338
00:27:56.125 --> 00:27:59.750
But I won't lose my passion just because of that!

339
00:28:00.875 --> 00:28:02.875
The flame in my heart wonâ€™t disappear.

340
00:28:04.125 --> 00:28:05.625
I will never be disheartened.

341
00:28:06.542 --> 00:28:07.917
And Senjuro,

342
00:28:10.375 --> 00:28:12.625
you are different from me!

343
00:28:13.667 --> 00:28:17.792
You have a big brother. And he believes in his little brother!

344
00:28:19.125 --> 00:28:22.958
Whatever path you walk, you'll be a great person!

345
00:28:23.708 --> 00:28:25.833
You have a burning passion in your heart!

346
00:28:26.042 --> 00:28:27.042
So let's do our best.

347
00:28:27.625 --> 00:28:28.958
Let's work hard in life!

348
00:28:29.917 --> 00:28:31.083
Even if we're lonely!

349
00:28:38.750 --> 00:28:40.083
What a nice feeling.

350
00:28:40.833 --> 00:28:44.957
The rope I created can invade the dreams of those bound by it.

351
00:28:44.958 --> 00:28:46.958
It is a special spell.

352
00:28:47.750 --> 00:28:51.750
I always pay attention during battle.

353
00:28:52.833 --> 00:28:56.041
As long as they keep sleeping, whether they are Hashira or something else,

354
00:28:56.042 --> 00:28:57.750
they are no different from babies.

355
00:28:58.500 --> 00:29:00.124
Let us have a good feast,

356
00:29:00.125 --> 00:29:03.458
after we get rid of the demon slayers.

357
00:29:12.375 --> 00:29:14.542
There's no need to swing down in a rush.

358
00:29:15.542 --> 00:29:16.750
Relax your shoulder.

359
00:29:18.500 --> 00:29:19.500
Like this?

360
00:29:19.750 --> 00:29:20.750
That's right.

361
00:29:22.167 --> 00:29:24.542
Itâ€™s dangerous. His actual self is here.

362
00:29:25.708 --> 00:29:27.500
I have to do it without being noticed.

363
00:29:29.417 --> 00:29:33.083
I need to hurry and get to the edge of the dream!

364
00:29:35.167 --> 00:29:38.375
The world of dreams that I show, is not infinite.

365
00:29:39.750 --> 00:29:43.333
The centre of the hearts of those who see my dreams, becomes circular.

366
00:29:44.708 --> 00:29:47.792
There is an unconscious area outside of the dream.

367
00:29:48.167 --> 00:29:51.125
Over there, the spirit core exists.

368
00:29:52.542 --> 00:29:54.208
Destroy it.

369
00:29:55.500 --> 00:29:57.875
After that, the owner of the dreamâ€¦

370
00:29:58.292 --> 00:29:59.875
â€¦becomes but a shell.

371
00:30:07.958 --> 00:30:08.958
There it is!

372
00:30:09.542 --> 00:30:13.125
The scenery continues, but I canâ€™t go any further.

373
00:30:16.542 --> 00:30:19.708
I have to destroy this manâ€™s spirit core quickly.

374
00:30:22.542 --> 00:30:26.458
I want to see happy dreams too!

375
00:30:36.250 --> 00:30:38.250
What a strange unconscious area.

376
00:30:39.167 --> 00:30:41.542
Itâ€™s hot. Itâ€™s burning.

377
00:30:42.750 --> 00:30:43.792
I have to hurry.

378
00:31:00.708 --> 00:31:03.208
Found it! The spirit core.

379
00:31:05.958 --> 00:31:07.833
This is my first time seeing a red one.

380
00:31:11.958 --> 00:31:13.375
If I break it,

381
00:31:14.417 --> 00:31:15.542
then I, too, willâ€¦!

382
00:31:39.292 --> 00:31:44.458
Ordinarily, a human should not be able to move when under this spellâ€¦

383
00:31:48.917 --> 00:31:51.500
What incredible survival instinct!

384
00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:03.208
Today, Mother will make Tanjiroâ€™s favourite rice crackers.

385
00:32:05.042 --> 00:32:07.667
Now, to crush the old mochi.

386
00:32:08.333 --> 00:32:09.416
Isnâ€™t it good, Rokuta?

387
00:32:09.417 --> 00:32:10.583
Rice crackers!

388
00:32:10.958 --> 00:32:15.292
Itâ€™s unfair! Brother isn't the only one who likes rice crackers.

389
00:32:15.625 --> 00:32:17.124
I like it too.

390
00:32:17.125 --> 00:32:18.249
Me too!

391
00:32:18.250 --> 00:32:20.625
Then letâ€™s eat it together.

392
00:32:21.250 --> 00:32:22.749
Can you guys prepare the net?

393
00:32:22.750 --> 00:32:23.917
Okay!

394
00:32:24.708 --> 00:32:26.625
Iâ€™ll crush it in the mortar.

395
00:32:26.792 --> 00:32:29.333
Then Iâ€™ll be in charge of turning it over.

396
00:32:29.583 --> 00:32:30.583
Me too!

397
00:32:31.125 --> 00:32:33.333
Then, I'll be in charge of eating.

398
00:32:33.750 --> 00:32:35.083
It's not fair!

399
00:32:48.917 --> 00:32:49.958
Yep.

400
00:32:51.583 --> 00:32:53.000
Nezuko, letâ€™s go.

401
00:33:02.167 --> 00:33:03.792
What did I just say?

402
00:33:07.250 --> 00:33:08.250
Iâ€™m home.

403
00:33:10.292 --> 00:33:11.708
Welcome home, Tanjiro.

404
00:33:12.750 --> 00:33:14.000
Yes. Iâ€™m home.

405
00:33:16.250 --> 00:33:17.708
Brother, welcome home.

406
00:33:21.875 --> 00:33:22.875
Huh? Where is Nezuko?

407
00:33:23.250 --> 00:33:25.708
Big Sister is picking herbs in the mountain.

408
00:33:26.292 --> 00:33:28.000
In the middle of the day?

409
00:33:30.917 --> 00:33:31.917
Is it not allowed?

410
00:33:32.625 --> 00:33:34.333
Ahâ€¦ no.

411
00:33:35.083 --> 00:33:36.333
Huh?

412
00:33:36.500 --> 00:33:37.500
Tanjiro.

413
00:33:37.708 --> 00:33:39.375
Could you please prepare the bath?

414
00:33:39.833 --> 00:33:41.625
This task might take a while in here.

415
00:33:45.708 --> 00:33:47.500
I keep saying weird stuff.

416
00:33:49.125 --> 00:33:50.333
Maybe Iâ€™m just tired.

417
00:33:57.458 --> 00:33:59.208
It disappearedâ€¦

418
00:34:01.542 --> 00:34:02.667
What was that?

419
00:34:03.167 --> 00:34:06.000
A tool box?

420
00:34:10.250 --> 00:34:11.417
Am I hallucinating?

421
00:34:15.375 --> 00:34:16.583
Wake up!

422
00:34:19.750 --> 00:34:20.750
Wake up!

423
00:34:25.042 --> 00:34:26.042
Wake up!

424
00:34:26.083 --> 00:34:27.125
We're under attack!

425
00:34:27.792 --> 00:34:28.792
Itâ€™s a dream.

426
00:34:28.875 --> 00:34:30.207
This is a dream!

427
00:34:30.208 --> 00:34:31.375
Open your eyes!

428
00:34:32.375 --> 00:34:34.792
Yes. That's right, I was actuallyâ€¦

429
00:34:36.292 --> 00:34:37.542
â€¦on board the train!

430
00:34:38.292 --> 00:34:41.125
Wake up and fight. Fight.

431
00:34:42.375 --> 00:34:44.667
Fight it!

432
00:34:49.625 --> 00:34:51.583
Brother, give me some pickled radish.

433
00:34:51.750 --> 00:34:54.417
No. Stop that.

434
00:34:54.792 --> 00:34:57.791
Why do you want Brotherâ€™s food so badly?

435
00:34:57.792 --> 00:34:58.958
What of it?

436
00:34:59.167 --> 00:35:01.292
Didn't you have a second helping just now?

437
00:35:03.917 --> 00:35:07.042
This is bad. I can't wake up. I'm inside a dream.

438
00:35:07.833 --> 00:35:09.042
What should I do to get out?

439
00:35:09.667 --> 00:35:11.542
Despite already knowing it's a dreamâ€¦

440
00:35:12.875 --> 00:35:14.042
What should I do?

441
00:35:32.708 --> 00:35:33.833
If I donâ€™t wake upâ€¦

442
00:36:00.750 --> 00:36:03.708
Mmhh! Mmhh!

443
00:36:12.208 --> 00:36:13.541
Brother!

444
00:36:13.542 --> 00:36:14.832
What should we do? The fire isâ€¦

445
00:36:14.833 --> 00:36:15.833
Brother!

446
00:36:18.708 --> 00:36:22.042
Itâ€™s Nezukoâ€™s scent. Nezukoâ€™s blood!

447
00:36:23.958 --> 00:36:24.958
Nezukoâ€¦

448
00:36:25.833 --> 00:36:26.833
Nezuko!

449
00:36:31.667 --> 00:36:35.708
The corps uniform. Nichirin Sword. Iâ€™m waking up!

450
00:36:36.667 --> 00:36:39.292
Slowly but surely!

451
00:36:40.250 --> 00:36:41.250
Brother?

452
00:36:41.542 --> 00:36:43.208
Brother, are you alright?

453
00:36:43.500 --> 00:36:44.625
Brotherâ€¦

454
00:36:45.792 --> 00:36:48.083
Sorry, I have to go.

455
00:36:53.542 --> 00:36:55.042
Unless I get back quicklyâ€¦

456
00:36:57.250 --> 00:36:58.250
Iâ€™m really sorry.

457
00:36:59.042 --> 00:37:02.042
Brother!

458
00:37:07.958 --> 00:37:10.458
If the demon who showed me this dream is nearby,

459
00:37:11.500 --> 00:37:13.375
I must find it quickly and slay it!

460
00:37:15.625 --> 00:37:17.458
Where are they? I must hurry.

461
00:37:20.625 --> 00:37:22.500
Brother, where are you going?

462
00:37:30.167 --> 00:37:32.667
I got plenty of mountain herbs today.

463
00:37:37.708 --> 00:37:39.500
Mother, over here!

464
00:37:39.792 --> 00:37:42.125
Brother was on fire!

465
00:37:45.333 --> 00:37:46.375
Motherâ€¦

466
00:37:47.167 --> 00:37:49.583
Tanjiro, are you alright?

467
00:37:50.292 --> 00:37:51.500
Brother.

468
00:37:58.708 --> 00:38:02.292
What's going on, Tanjiro? And your clothes are different.

469
00:38:11.292 --> 00:38:12.292
Ah.

470
00:38:13.750 --> 00:38:15.250
I want to stay here.

471
00:38:15.917 --> 00:38:16.917
Forever.

472
00:38:20.500 --> 00:38:22.333
I want to turn back and return to the past.

473
00:38:24.083 --> 00:38:29.667
If this was real, it should have been my life.

474
00:38:32.125 --> 00:38:33.125
If this is realâ€¦

475
00:38:34.250 --> 00:38:35.875
Everyone would still be alive today.

476
00:38:37.958 --> 00:38:42.667
Even Nezuko, standing under the blue skyâ€¦

477
00:38:45.750 --> 00:38:48.667
If this was real, if it's realâ€¦

478
00:38:50.250 --> 00:38:53.458
I would be burning the charcoal.

479
00:38:54.708 --> 00:38:56.708
I would never have touched the sword.

480
00:39:00.500 --> 00:39:01.667
If this was realâ€¦

481
00:39:03.875 --> 00:39:05.042
If this was real!

482
00:39:18.958 --> 00:39:21.583
But I have already lost them.

483
00:39:22.417 --> 00:39:23.667
I can't ever go back.

484
00:39:27.625 --> 00:39:28.917
Brother!

485
00:39:29.583 --> 00:39:31.625
Donâ€™t leave me!

486
00:39:38.292 --> 00:39:39.292
Iâ€™m sorry.

487
00:39:40.292 --> 00:39:41.875
Iâ€™m so sorry, Rokuta.

488
00:39:44.833 --> 00:39:46.375
We can't be together anymore.

489
00:39:47.750 --> 00:39:51.792
But Brother will always be thinking of you.

490
00:39:53.042 --> 00:39:55.250
I will be always thinking of you all.

491
00:39:58.500 --> 00:40:01.083
I'm thankful for so much.

492
00:40:02.083 --> 00:40:04.583
I'm sorry for so much.

493
00:40:05.500 --> 00:40:07.000
I have never forgotten a single thing.

494
00:40:07.833 --> 00:40:11.042
No matter when or how, my feelings have never left me.

495
00:40:12.125 --> 00:40:13.125
And soâ€¦

496
00:40:14.250 --> 00:40:15.667
Please forgive me!

497
00:40:22.708 --> 00:40:26.833
I must destroy the spirit core quickly.

498
00:40:46.042 --> 00:40:48.625
So this is the inside of his heart.

499
00:40:51.083 --> 00:40:53.083
How beautiful.

500
00:40:54.125 --> 00:40:55.708
Itâ€™s so vast.

501
00:40:56.625 --> 00:41:00.250
Moreover, itâ€™s warm.

502
00:41:10.958 --> 00:41:14.417
Where is the spirit core?

503
00:41:16.375 --> 00:41:19.542
What the heck is this unconscious areaâ€¦

504
00:41:21.667 --> 00:41:24.583
That disgusting naked boar.

505
00:41:25.750 --> 00:41:27.542
What a bother this is.

506
00:41:31.625 --> 00:41:32.833
Kyaaaaa!!

507
00:41:34.083 --> 00:41:36.624
Why is he in the unconscious area?!

508
00:41:36.625 --> 00:41:38.625
Thatâ€¦ naked... boar!

509
00:41:44.083 --> 00:41:46.542
Kyaaaaaaa!!

510
00:41:50.458 --> 00:41:51.750
It's pitch-black.

511
00:41:53.792 --> 00:41:55.875
I canâ€™t see anything because itâ€™s too dark.

512
00:41:56.333 --> 00:42:01.208
Darn it. What the heck is that blond punk's unconscious area, anyway?

513
00:42:02.208 --> 00:42:06.667
I have to search out the spirit core by fumbling around this area?

514
00:42:07.333 --> 00:42:08.833
You have got to be kidding.

515
00:42:11.542 --> 00:42:12.542
What was that?

516
00:42:22.792 --> 00:42:26.792
What is a man doing in here? You piece of trash.

517
00:42:27.250 --> 00:42:30.792
Nezuko is the only one allowed in here, alright?

518
00:42:32.917 --> 00:42:34.583
I will kill you.

519
00:42:36.625 --> 00:42:38.167
Where is Nezuko?

520
00:42:38.625 --> 00:42:40.167
I donâ€™t know!

521
00:42:41.375 --> 00:42:42.708
Then, dieâ€¦

522
00:42:46.125 --> 00:42:47.167
No!

523
00:42:53.875 --> 00:42:55.500
This is disturbing.

524
00:42:56.208 --> 00:42:57.625
What is happening?

525
00:42:58.250 --> 00:43:01.167
Not a single spirit core has been successfully destroyed.

526
00:43:03.333 --> 00:43:04.333
Wellâ€¦

527
00:43:04.833 --> 00:43:07.667
They must be buying time, so it's alright.

528
00:43:12.750 --> 00:43:13.750
Itâ€™s gone.

529
00:43:13.958 --> 00:43:15.124
The scentâ€¦

530
00:43:15.125 --> 00:43:16.125
â€¦is faint.

531
00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:18.000
But what was that?

532
00:43:18.417 --> 00:43:19.958
It seems to have a membrane.

533
00:43:21.250 --> 00:43:24.250
The demon's scent is faint, I can smell it.

534
00:43:25.083 --> 00:43:26.542
I can't pinpoint the location!

535
00:43:27.292 --> 00:43:28.500
I have to hurry!

536
00:43:29.292 --> 00:43:31.083
Nezuko is bleeding.

537
00:43:31.792 --> 00:43:35.208
If everyone else is still sleeping, things are certainly not looking good.

538
00:43:36.042 --> 00:43:37.042
What should I do?

539
00:43:39.958 --> 00:43:42.083
Am I not maintaining Total Concentration Breathing?

540
00:43:43.250 --> 00:43:45.500
Am I still asleep right now?!

541
00:43:47.333 --> 00:43:48.333
Tanjiro.

542
00:43:53.625 --> 00:43:55.083
Wield your sword.

543
00:43:57.042 --> 00:43:59.792
There is something that needs to be cut.

544
00:44:10.583 --> 00:44:14.208
There is something that needs to be cut.

545
00:44:16.750 --> 00:44:18.000
Something needs to be cutâ€¦

546
00:44:18.833 --> 00:44:20.208
â€¦in order for me to wake up.

547
00:44:22.083 --> 00:44:23.167
I think I understand.

548
00:44:24.625 --> 00:44:26.917
But what if I'm wrong?

549
00:44:28.083 --> 00:44:31.167
If what happens in a dream could affect reality,

550
00:44:32.125 --> 00:44:33.125
it might be irreversible.

551
00:44:36.583 --> 00:44:38.583
Donâ€™t hesitate! Do it!

552
00:44:38.958 --> 00:44:39.958
Iâ€™ll do it!

553
00:44:40.458 --> 00:44:42.875
Dying within a dream is to connect with reality.

554
00:44:43.500 --> 00:44:44.500
So, in other wordsâ€¦

555
00:44:46.167 --> 00:44:47.583
The thing that needs to be cut, isâ€¦

556
00:44:50.458 --> 00:44:52.958
â€¦my own neck!

557
00:45:10.375 --> 00:45:12.250
Itâ€™s okay. Iâ€™m alive.

558
00:45:17.917 --> 00:45:19.542
Nezuko, are you alright?

559
00:45:20.167 --> 00:45:21.167
Yeah.

560
00:45:22.792 --> 00:45:23.792
Nezukoâ€¦

561
00:45:25.833 --> 00:45:26.833
Zenitsu.

562
00:45:27.750 --> 00:45:28.750
Inosuke.

563
00:45:29.583 --> 00:45:30.583
Rengoku.

564
00:45:31.583 --> 00:45:32.583
Huh?

565
00:45:35.042 --> 00:45:36.500
Who are these people?

566
00:45:37.750 --> 00:45:40.250
Their wrists are bound by rope.

567
00:45:41.750 --> 00:45:42.750
The ropeâ€¦

568
00:45:45.708 --> 00:45:48.292
What is this? It's burnt.

569
00:45:49.042 --> 00:45:50.458
Was it Nezukoâ€™s blood burning?

570
00:45:51.792 --> 00:45:53.750
Even if just a little, it smells like demon.

571
00:45:56.250 --> 00:45:58.042
This smell?! The ticket!

572
00:45:59.708 --> 00:46:02.750
As I thought, this one has a faint demon's scent too.

573
00:46:03.917 --> 00:46:06.083
We were being put to sleep after he cut our tickets.

574
00:46:07.250 --> 00:46:08.792
It was the demon's work.

575
00:46:09.917 --> 00:46:14.375
What powerful Blood Demon Art with barely a trace of scent.

576
00:46:17.417 --> 00:46:18.417
What is this?

577
00:46:19.458 --> 00:46:23.458
I have a feeling that cutting this with the Nichirin Sword would be a bad idea.

578
00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:27.542
Nezuko, please.

579
00:46:28.208 --> 00:46:29.667
Burn all their ropes!

580
00:46:37.833 --> 00:46:39.583
Zenitsu, wake up!

581
00:46:40.208 --> 00:46:41.583
Wake up, Zenitsu!

582
00:46:41.750 --> 00:46:43.000
Open your eyes!

583
00:46:45.708 --> 00:46:47.082
Wake up, Inosuke!

584
00:46:47.083 --> 00:46:48.125
Please!

585
00:46:49.250 --> 00:46:50.250
Inosukeâ€¦

586
00:46:50.958 --> 00:46:52.458
Hmmh.

587
00:46:53.167 --> 00:46:55.000
There, there. Iâ€™m sorry.

588
00:46:56.208 --> 00:46:58.833
Thank you. You worked hard, Nezuko.

589
00:47:02.667 --> 00:47:05.125
This is bad, these two wonâ€™t open their eyes.

590
00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:07.125
What should I do?

591
00:47:10.625 --> 00:47:11.625
Rengoku.

592
00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:16.000
What?

593
00:47:18.708 --> 00:47:21.667
Is she being manipulated by the demon?

594
00:47:22.042 --> 00:47:23.750
Donâ€™t get in the way!

595
00:47:23.958 --> 00:47:25.750
Itâ€™s all your fault for coming here.

596
00:47:25.833 --> 00:47:27.708
We wonâ€™t get our dream, you know!

597
00:47:30.208 --> 00:47:31.542
She's acting on her own will?

598
00:47:33.917 --> 00:47:34.917
This guy tooâ€¦

599
00:47:38.792 --> 00:47:39.792
What are you doing?!

600
00:47:40.625 --> 00:47:42.958
If you're awake, help me!

601
00:47:43.458 --> 00:47:45.624
I donâ€™t care if you have tuberculosis or whatever.

602
00:47:45.625 --> 00:47:47.124
If you donâ€™t work properly,

603
00:47:47.125 --> 00:47:50.958
you wonâ€™t get to see the dreams he promised!

604
00:47:54.333 --> 00:47:56.417
I wonder if he was the guy who was connected with me.

605
00:47:57.625 --> 00:48:02.083
Tuberculosisâ€¦ Heâ€™s sick. Poor guy.

606
00:48:03.625 --> 00:48:05.083
That demon is deplorable.

607
00:48:06.083 --> 00:48:08.042
He took advantage of their hearts.

608
00:48:10.750 --> 00:48:11.750
Sorry.

609
00:48:12.542 --> 00:48:14.625
But I have to fight.

610
00:48:31.042 --> 00:48:33.500
You want to be in a happy dream, don't you?

611
00:48:34.750 --> 00:48:35.750
I understand.

612
00:48:37.250 --> 00:48:40.167
I wanted to be in a happy dream too.

613
00:48:45.750 --> 00:48:47.875
I wish that this side was the dream, instead.

614
00:48:59.083 --> 00:49:03.917
I thought that if only I could relieve myself of the suffering from this illness,

615
00:49:04.750 --> 00:49:07.417
it would be okay to hurt another person.

616
00:49:09.583 --> 00:49:11.792
But, when I was inside your dreamâ€¦

617
00:49:12.625 --> 00:49:14.958
Your heart is warm.

618
00:49:17.333 --> 00:49:20.250
You must be his heartâ€™s personification.

619
00:49:24.333 --> 00:49:27.083
The air here is clear and it is comfortable.

620
00:49:35.083 --> 00:49:38.250
This isâ€¦ a spirit core.

621
00:49:39.458 --> 00:49:40.500
Why did you show it to me?

622
00:49:44.667 --> 00:49:48.458
Because I was looking for it, you guided me here?

623
00:49:54.417 --> 00:49:55.500
No way.

624
00:49:56.583 --> 00:49:58.958
I was planning on breaking it.

625
00:50:00.167 --> 00:50:01.208
Why did youâ€¦?

626
00:50:03.583 --> 00:50:08.750
The tiny light beings within you have illuminated my heart.

627
00:50:12.292 --> 00:50:13.375
Are you alright?

628
00:50:16.333 --> 00:50:17.542
Thank you.

629
00:50:19.667 --> 00:50:20.667
Be careful.

630
00:50:25.125 --> 00:50:26.125
Yes.

631
00:50:26.333 --> 00:50:27.333
Nezuko!

632
00:50:39.375 --> 00:50:40.750
What a stench!

633
00:50:41.583 --> 00:50:42.583
It's strong.

634
00:50:42.958 --> 00:50:46.292
The demon's scent has been carried here by the wind.

635
00:50:47.042 --> 00:50:49.458
Was I sleeping at a time like this?

636
00:50:50.583 --> 00:50:52.917
Even though the passenger cars were sealedâ€¦

637
00:50:53.417 --> 00:50:54.542
I can't believe it.

638
00:50:55.667 --> 00:50:56.667
I don't knowâ€¦

639
00:50:57.792 --> 00:50:59.167
The demon is upwind.

640
00:50:59.625 --> 00:51:01.167
At the front carriage?

641
00:51:04.958 --> 00:51:07.917
Nezuko, donâ€™t follow me! Itâ€™s not safe, so just wait there!

642
00:51:08.708 --> 00:51:10.000
Take care of the others!

643
00:51:18.250 --> 00:51:20.458
Oh, did you wake up?

644
00:51:20.917 --> 00:51:21.917
Good morning.

645
00:51:22.500 --> 00:51:26.167
I would rather have you still asleep, though.

646
00:51:27.375 --> 00:51:28.750
This guy isâ€¦

647
00:51:30.125 --> 00:51:31.375
But why?

648
00:51:32.792 --> 00:51:36.542
You experienced a good dream at last, didn't you?

649
00:51:37.042 --> 00:51:42.792
I could have shown you a dream of your whole family being slaughtered, you know?

650
00:51:43.083 --> 00:51:45.582
Would you prefer that?

651
00:51:45.583 --> 00:51:48.250
Surely not? It would be difficult, no?

652
00:51:51.583 --> 00:51:53.208
So, next timeâ€¦

653
00:51:53.417 --> 00:51:57.333
How about I show you a dream in which your father was revived?

654
00:52:07.083 --> 00:52:11.791
I must say, I like to show a nightmareâ€¦

655
00:52:11.792 --> 00:52:15.292
â€¦after I show someone a good dream.

656
00:52:16.083 --> 00:52:20.042
I love to see the contortions of a human face!

657
00:52:21.125 --> 00:52:23.042
I canâ€™t help myself.

658
00:52:23.750 --> 00:52:32.292
To gaze upon someone struggling with their grief and suffering - so much fun!

659
00:52:33.125 --> 00:52:35.792
But I wasnâ€™t careful enough.

660
00:52:36.167 --> 00:52:40.292
Even if I were to use a roundabout method, I will surely kill you, demon slayer.

661
00:52:41.417 --> 00:52:45.625
My blood was mixed with ink on the tickets.

662
00:52:46.042 --> 00:52:50.292
If the conductor cut the tickets and marked it,

663
00:52:51.625 --> 00:52:53.708
my spell would be activated.

664
00:52:57.250 --> 00:53:02.375
Despite that, why is he awake?

665
00:53:03.167 --> 00:53:06.500
In a short time, he figured out a way to wake up.

666
00:53:07.208 --> 00:53:18.000
The human desire for happy, comfortable dreams is an awesome thing though.

667
00:53:20.708 --> 00:53:23.667
Do not trample into peopleâ€™s hearts!

668
00:53:24.375 --> 00:53:28.292
I will not forgive you!

669
00:53:30.667 --> 00:53:33.667
What's this? Is he wearing earrings?

670
00:53:37.750 --> 00:53:43.083
I'm so lucky. He came to where I am!

671
00:53:43.625 --> 00:53:45.707
Itâ€™s like a dream.

672
00:53:45.708 --> 00:53:50.333
With this, I can receive more of Muzanâ€™s blood.

673
00:53:50.958 --> 00:53:54.332
After that, if I become stronger,

674
00:53:54.333 --> 00:53:59.083
I can challenge the Upper Rank Demons to Blood Battle and replace them.

675
00:54:01.958 --> 00:54:03.375
Water Breathing.

676
00:54:04.875 --> 00:54:06.416
Tenth Form.

677
00:54:06.417 --> 00:54:08.708
Constant Flux.

678
00:54:13.750 --> 00:54:15.042
Blood Demon Art.

679
00:54:17.750 --> 00:54:21.957
Whispers of Forced Unconscious Hypnosis!

680
00:54:21.958 --> 00:54:25.542
Go to sleep.

681
00:54:34.625 --> 00:54:35.833
He's not falling asleep?

682
00:54:41.375 --> 00:54:42.375
Go to sleep.

683
00:54:50.042 --> 00:54:51.167
Go to sleep.

684
00:54:53.833 --> 00:54:56.125
Go to sleep. Go to sleep.

685
00:55:00.125 --> 00:55:06.208
Go to sleep already!

686
00:55:07.292 --> 00:55:09.624
It doesnâ€™t work. Why?

687
00:55:09.625 --> 00:55:11.166
No, that's not the case.

688
00:55:11.167 --> 00:55:16.083
This guy fell for the spell many times.

689
00:55:22.875 --> 00:55:25.917
The moment he fell for it, he recognised it.

690
00:55:29.375 --> 00:55:32.333
He committed suicide in order to wake up.

691
00:55:37.917 --> 00:55:41.583
Even if only in a dream, committing suicide meansâ€¦

692
00:55:41.958 --> 00:55:44.750
â€¦to kill oneself.

693
00:55:45.250 --> 00:55:47.375
A fair amount of strength is needed to do that.

694
00:55:47.625 --> 00:55:53.458
This punk is... extraordinary.

695
00:56:02.250 --> 00:56:07.500
Why didnâ€™t you save us?

696
00:56:10.875 --> 00:56:14.500
When we were being killed, what were you doing?

697
00:56:17.292 --> 00:56:20.667
You wanted to remain alive, by yourself.

698
00:56:29.125 --> 00:56:32.000
For what purpose is your existence?

699
00:56:32.375 --> 00:56:34.000
Useless.

700
00:56:42.375 --> 00:56:45.083
I wish you were dead.

701
00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:49.167
How dare you live on happily?

702
00:56:56.792 --> 00:56:59.582
They wouldnâ€™t say anything like that!

703
00:56:59.583 --> 00:57:01.832
My familyâ€¦

704
00:57:01.833 --> 00:57:08.208
Do not insult my family!

705
00:57:33.583 --> 00:57:35.458
There is almost no response.

706
00:57:36.917 --> 00:57:38.958
What if this is also a dream?

707
00:57:39.458 --> 00:57:42.917
Or is this demon weaker than him?

708
00:57:44.500 --> 00:57:46.083
â€œThat personâ€ told me...

709
00:57:47.083 --> 00:57:51.542
â€¦that besides the Hashira, he wants me to kill the earring boy.

710
00:57:53.292 --> 00:57:56.458
I know that feeling well.

711
00:57:56.875 --> 00:57:59.500
Somehow, your existenceâ€¦

712
00:58:00.125 --> 00:58:03.708
Anyway, it makes me uncomfortable.

713
00:58:04.417 --> 00:58:05.708
He doesnâ€™t die?!

714
00:58:06.375 --> 00:58:08.875
What a wonderful expression!

715
00:58:09.292 --> 00:58:12.250
That's the kind of face I want to see.

716
00:58:14.208 --> 00:58:19.000
My neck was slashed, but why didnâ€™t I die? You want me to tell you, don't you?

717
00:58:19.542 --> 00:58:23.542
Fine, since I'm in a good mood right now.

718
00:58:24.333 --> 00:58:28.167
It's so simple that even a baby could understand.

719
00:58:30.333 --> 00:58:34.125
It's because that was no longer my actual body.

720
00:58:34.792 --> 00:58:37.916
Even what you see talking right now,

721
00:58:37.917 --> 00:58:41.500
has the shape of a head but isn't actually one.

722
00:58:42.042 --> 00:58:45.292
While you were sleeping comfortably,

723
00:58:45.708 --> 00:58:49.208
I fused with this train!

724
00:58:50.375 --> 00:58:57.000
This whole train has become my blood, flesh, and bones.

725
00:58:58.292 --> 00:59:01.957
That face of yours! Did you understand what I said?

726
00:59:01.958 --> 00:59:06.999
In other words, over two hundred passengers in this trainâ€¦

727
00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:13.541
â€¦are food for strengthening my body, and my hostages too.

728
00:59:13.542 --> 00:59:16.249
Hey, can you protect them?

729
00:59:16.250 --> 00:59:18.041
You're alone after all.

730
00:59:18.042 --> 00:59:24.791
All these humans squirming from end to endâ€¦

731
00:59:24.792 --> 00:59:28.292
Can you leave them to me?

732
00:59:35.417 --> 00:59:38.124
What should I do? What should I do?

733
00:59:38.125 --> 00:59:41.374
Protecting two carriages is my limit.

734
00:59:41.375 --> 00:59:43.542
Any more, and I canâ€™t guarantee their safety.

735
00:59:44.792 --> 00:59:45.999
Rengoku.

736
00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:48.624
Zenitsu, Inosuke!

737
00:59:48.625 --> 00:59:50.332
This is no time to sleep!

738
00:59:50.333 --> 00:59:52.875
Open your eyes, please!

739
00:59:53.458 --> 00:59:54.874
Nezuko!

740
00:59:54.875 --> 00:59:58.042
You have to protect those who are sleeping!

741
01:00:09.292 --> 01:00:11.707
Follow me, minions!

742
01:00:11.708 --> 01:00:13.207
Alright!

743
01:00:13.208 --> 01:00:15.000
Explosive awakening!

744
01:00:15.917 --> 01:00:17.875
Head-Long Rush!

745
01:00:18.708 --> 01:00:21.708
Inosuke is coming!

746
01:00:21.833 --> 01:00:25.707
Inosuke! This train is not safe anymore.

747
01:00:25.708 --> 01:00:28.041
We have to protect the sleeping people!

748
01:00:28.042 --> 01:00:30.582
The whole train has become a demon!

749
01:00:30.583 --> 01:00:33.750
Did you hear me? The entire train has become a demon!

750
01:00:35.625 --> 01:00:38.875
Just as I thought. I expected this.

751
01:00:39.417 --> 01:00:43.375
In other word, as the boss, I was right!

752
01:00:47.708 --> 01:00:49.457
Beast Breathing.

753
01:00:49.458 --> 01:00:51.166
Fifth Fang.

754
01:00:51.167 --> 01:00:53.167
Crazy Cutting!

755
01:00:57.833 --> 01:01:01.082
I will save every single one of them.

756
01:01:01.083 --> 01:01:03.291
All of you, prostrate over me!

757
01:01:03.292 --> 01:01:05.292
Worship and praise me!

758
01:01:05.333 --> 01:01:07.333
My amazing self,

759
01:01:07.708 --> 01:01:12.750
Inosuke Hashibira, is coming through!

760
01:01:13.250 --> 01:01:15.957
I have to save the passengers too.

761
01:01:15.958 --> 01:01:20.000
If Inosuke is protecting this area, I can move to the next.

762
01:01:45.958 --> 01:01:47.375
It's become like this!

763
01:01:49.958 --> 01:01:51.916
Water Breathing.

764
01:01:51.917 --> 01:01:53.207
First Form.

765
01:01:53.208 --> 01:01:55.208
Water Surface Slash.

766
01:01:57.875 --> 01:02:01.000
This is bad. There is no end to this.

767
01:02:01.625 --> 01:02:03.375
How should I prevent it?

768
01:02:10.250 --> 01:02:12.082
Wretched demon slayersâ€¦

769
01:02:12.083 --> 01:02:15.375
Inside my body, little by littleâ€¦

770
01:02:16.083 --> 01:02:19.374
No matter how many times you slash, Iâ€™ll regenerate.

771
01:02:19.375 --> 01:02:24.166
And you will be exhausted.

772
01:02:24.167 --> 01:02:30.333
I will take my time to devour the two hundred passengers.

773
01:03:41.458 --> 01:03:43.957
Thunder Breathing.

774
01:03:43.958 --> 01:03:45.832
First Form.

775
01:03:45.833 --> 01:03:47.125
Thunderclap and Flash.

776
01:03:51.125 --> 01:03:52.333
SixFold!!

777
01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:56.333
I will protect Nezuko.

778
01:03:59.375 --> 01:04:04.333
Protect...

779
01:04:07.583 --> 01:04:11.166
It sounded like thunder. Was it from the back carriage?

780
01:04:11.167 --> 01:04:13.082
I don't get what's going on.

781
01:04:13.083 --> 01:04:17.041
Is Zenitsu waking up? What about Rengoku?

782
01:04:17.042 --> 01:04:18.083
How is Nezuko doing?

783
01:04:23.708 --> 01:04:26.542
The most I can do is to protect whoever is in front of me.

784
01:04:27.458 --> 01:04:29.082
This is bad, what should I do?

785
01:04:29.083 --> 01:04:31.082
I canâ€™t cooperate with anyone.

786
01:04:31.083 --> 01:04:33.917
Are the passengers in the back carriage safe?

787
01:04:34.333 --> 01:04:37.582
Darn it. It's narrow!

788
01:04:37.583 --> 01:04:39.583
It's tough swinging the swords too!

789
01:04:44.250 --> 01:04:46.124
Hmm.

790
01:04:46.125 --> 01:04:50.083
Things got this bad while I was taking a nap?

791
01:04:50.833 --> 01:04:53.125
Sure, sure.

792
01:04:53.708 --> 01:04:56.000
As a Hashira, Iâ€™m ashamed of myself!

793
01:04:57.500 --> 01:05:02.500
If there's a hole, I want to crawl into it!

794
01:05:09.583 --> 01:05:10.667
Wh-What?

795
01:05:16.625 --> 01:05:19.917
What was that just now? A demon attacking?

796
01:05:22.125 --> 01:05:23.500
Kamado boy!

797
01:05:25.417 --> 01:05:26.750
Rengoku!

798
01:05:27.083 --> 01:05:30.332
I managed to do considerable damage slashing while making my way here.

799
01:05:30.333 --> 01:05:33.416
I think the demon will need some time to regenerate.

800
01:05:33.417 --> 01:05:35.624
But we have no time! Iâ€™ll say it quickly!

801
01:05:35.625 --> 01:05:36.625
Yes!

802
01:05:36.958 --> 01:05:41.416
This train has eight carriages. I will protect the five back carriages.

803
01:05:41.417 --> 01:05:45.624
The blond youth and your little sister will protect the remaining three carriages.

804
01:05:45.625 --> 01:05:47.291
As for you and the boar head boy,

805
01:05:47.292 --> 01:05:51.416
keep watch on those three cars and look out for the demonâ€™s neck.

806
01:05:51.417 --> 01:05:54.041
Neck? But this demon isâ€¦

807
01:05:54.042 --> 01:05:55.874
No matter what form the demon has taken,

808
01:05:55.875 --> 01:05:57.874
as long as he is a demon, he will have a neck!

809
01:05:57.875 --> 01:06:00.332
I will also search for the vital spot while fighting.

810
01:06:00.333 --> 01:06:02.333
Be more enthusiastic!

811
01:06:05.875 --> 01:06:07.750
Amazing! I couldn't see it.

812
01:06:08.208 --> 01:06:11.333
So, the tremors before were actually Rengoku?

813
01:06:12.333 --> 01:06:14.667
He grasped and assessed the situation quickly.

814
01:06:15.417 --> 01:06:16.667
Five carriages by himselfâ€¦

815
01:06:18.667 --> 01:06:22.749
This is no time to marvel, idiot! You have a job to do!

816
01:06:22.750 --> 01:06:26.375
The demonâ€™s scent is getting stronger. I have to hurry!

817
01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.375
Inosuke! Inosuke, where are you?!

818
01:06:30.958 --> 01:06:32.749
Shut up! Iâ€™ll kill you!

819
01:06:32.750 --> 01:06:33.999
You're above here?

820
01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.750
I was instructed by Googly Eyes!

821
01:06:38.792 --> 01:06:40.666
But, somehowâ€¦

822
01:06:40.667 --> 01:06:42.749
Somehowâ€¦

823
01:06:42.750 --> 01:06:44.916
Somehow, he is amazing.

824
01:06:44.917 --> 01:06:47.499
It irritates me!

825
01:06:47.500 --> 01:06:51.249
Inosuke! We have to keep a close watch on the front three carriages!

826
01:06:51.250 --> 01:06:53.124
I already know that!

827
01:06:53.125 --> 01:06:58.332
And I will find it in no time! With my powerful seventh form!

828
01:06:58.333 --> 01:07:00.499
This masterâ€™s vital spot!

829
01:07:00.500 --> 01:07:03.957
I see! As expected, it is in front?

830
01:07:03.958 --> 01:07:08.250
Yes, in front! Anyway, the front carriage feels creepy!

831
01:07:08.750 --> 01:07:12.207
The wind is strong, so the scent is drifting and is hard to pinpoint.

832
01:07:12.208 --> 01:07:14.208
But if Inosuke says so, then there is no doubt.

833
01:07:14.750 --> 01:07:16.999
It is around where the coals are piled up, right?!

834
01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:18.166
Thatâ€™s right!

835
01:07:18.167 --> 01:07:19.167
I got it!

836
01:07:19.583 --> 01:07:22.250
Alright, letâ€™s go! To the front!

837
01:07:34.750 --> 01:07:36.167
It's here, huh?

838
01:07:48.875 --> 01:07:50.042
Inosuke!

839
01:07:50.625 --> 01:07:55.832
Suspicious, indeed. Especially around here!

840
01:07:55.833 --> 01:07:59.042
What are you?! G-Get out!

841
01:07:59.667 --> 01:08:03.082
Demonâ€™s neck. Demonâ€™sâ€¦

842
01:08:03.083 --> 01:08:04.292
â€¦vital spot!

843
01:08:09.500 --> 01:08:10.458
Disgusting!

844
01:08:10.459 --> 01:08:12.542
Get away from me!

845
01:08:15.042 --> 01:08:16.250
Too many hands!

846
01:08:17.375 --> 01:08:18.375
Crap!

847
01:08:21.292 --> 01:08:22.666
Water Breathing.

848
01:08:22.667 --> 01:08:23.667
Sixth Form.

849
01:08:24.292 --> 01:08:25.792
Whirlpool.

850
01:08:33.542 --> 01:08:35.124
Inosuke, are you alright?!

851
01:08:35.125 --> 01:08:37.457
Itâ€™s not like I asked you to save me, you know?!

852
01:08:37.458 --> 01:08:38.625
I know.

853
01:08:41.500 --> 01:08:42.625
This isâ€¦

854
01:08:43.625 --> 01:08:44.792
Directly below us.

855
01:08:45.542 --> 01:08:48.833
The demon's scent is strong from directly below us!

856
01:08:49.167 --> 01:08:51.999
Inosuke! The demon's neck is directly below here!

857
01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.999
Donâ€™t give me orders! I am the boss!

858
01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:56.000
I got it!

859
01:08:56.500 --> 01:08:57.542
Look!

860
01:08:57.917 --> 01:08:59.624
Beast Breathing.

861
01:08:59.625 --> 01:09:00.750
Second Fang.

862
01:09:02.167 --> 01:09:04.000
Slice!

863
01:09:10.417 --> 01:09:13.167
The bones. The neck bones.

864
01:09:14.125 --> 01:09:15.125
Water Breathing.

865
01:09:15.375 --> 01:09:16.542
Eighth Form.

866
01:09:16.917 --> 01:09:19.250
Waterfall Basin.

867
01:09:22.333 --> 01:09:23.750
It got blocked!

868
01:09:39.958 --> 01:09:43.375
The rift is closed; it regenerates quickly!

869
01:09:44.250 --> 01:09:48.458
Moreover, the best I can do is to expose the bones with a single blow.

870
01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:50.625
I have to cut off the bones.

871
01:09:51.167 --> 01:09:54.916
Inosuke! Letâ€™s match our breathings and attack continuously!!

872
01:09:54.917 --> 01:09:59.291
One of us slashes the flesh while the other cuts off the bones!

873
01:09:59.292 --> 01:10:03.499
I see! Nice idea! Iâ€™ll commend you for that!

874
01:10:03.500 --> 01:10:04.500
Thank you!

875
01:10:06.125 --> 01:10:07.250
Let's go!

876
01:10:15.417 --> 01:10:19.708
Eyes of Forced Unconscious Sleep.

877
01:10:20.083 --> 01:10:21.542
Blood Demon Art!

878
01:10:22.083 --> 01:10:24.708
He got meâ€¦ Heâ€™ll make me sleep!!

879
01:10:25.667 --> 01:10:29.292
Inosuke, cut off your own neck while inside of the dream!

880
01:10:29.333 --> 01:10:30.708
You'll wake up!

881
01:10:35.417 --> 01:10:38.792
Itâ€™s fine. Even though I got put under the spell, I can break it!

882
01:10:39.708 --> 01:10:42.874
Stupid! Close your eyelids after you wake up.

883
01:10:42.875 --> 01:10:44.750
Or you'll get caught under the spell again.

884
01:10:46.125 --> 01:10:47.750
Alright, I woke up.

885
01:10:54.125 --> 01:10:55.624
The moment I wake up,

886
01:10:55.625 --> 01:10:58.957
the demonâ€™s eyes always meet mine!

887
01:10:58.958 --> 01:11:01.332
I have to keep my eyes closed when waking up!

888
01:11:01.333 --> 01:11:03.167
Keep my eyes closed.

889
01:11:05.167 --> 01:11:06.332
Itâ€™s no good!

890
01:11:06.333 --> 01:11:09.082
Awake! Awake!

891
01:11:09.083 --> 01:11:11.624
Hurry! The neck should beâ€¦

892
01:11:11.625 --> 01:11:13.583
Cut off! Cut off!

893
01:11:14.208 --> 01:11:15.917
I will wake up!

894
01:11:17.542 --> 01:11:21.250
Hurryâ€¦ and open my eyes!

895
01:11:25.625 --> 01:11:27.832
Itâ€™s not a dream. Itâ€™s reality!

896
01:11:27.833 --> 01:11:30.041
Donâ€™t fall for his trap!

897
01:11:30.042 --> 01:11:31.958
Donâ€™t die in a lame way!

898
01:11:36.583 --> 01:11:39.500
Iâ€™m wearing the hide of the mountain lord.

899
01:11:40.125 --> 01:11:42.667
Our eyes wonâ€™t meet!

900
01:11:44.333 --> 01:11:46.083
Small fry eyeballs!

901
01:11:46.333 --> 01:11:50.875
Thatâ€™s right. Itâ€™s hard to tell the direction of Inosukeâ€™s sight.

902
01:11:51.458 --> 01:11:55.083
Okay, all we have to do is slash this guy!

903
01:11:59.500 --> 01:12:00.999
Inosuke!

904
01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:04.500
Donâ€™t interfere with my dream!

905
01:12:10.917 --> 01:12:12.541
Were you stabbed?

906
01:12:12.542 --> 01:12:13.750
It's fine.

907
01:12:16.125 --> 01:12:18.333
Leave that jerk alone!

908
01:12:18.750 --> 01:12:20.833
No! I wonâ€™t let him die!

909
01:12:22.333 --> 01:12:25.708
If we donâ€™t hurry and slash the demonâ€™s neck, everyone wonâ€™t last!

910
01:12:26.042 --> 01:12:28.208
I understand! Letâ€™s hurry!

911
01:12:45.333 --> 01:12:48.541
Inosuke! Letâ€™s match our breathings.

912
01:12:48.542 --> 01:12:52.250
Weâ€™re going to cut off the demonâ€™s neck. Letâ€™s attack at the same time!

913
01:13:27.875 --> 01:13:30.250
This is bad. If I fall asleep nowâ€¦

914
01:13:30.542 --> 01:13:31.542
These good-for-nothings!

915
01:13:32.125 --> 01:13:34.416
Letâ€™s go! Follow me!

916
01:13:34.417 --> 01:13:36.166
Beast Breathing.

917
01:13:36.167 --> 01:13:37.500
Fourth Fang.

918
01:13:40.250 --> 01:13:42.375
Slice 'n' Dice!

919
01:13:45.792 --> 01:13:48.208
Father, please protect me.

920
01:13:48.792 --> 01:13:53.708
With this single blow, I will slice the bones!

921
01:13:54.208 --> 01:13:55.750
Hinokami Kagura.

922
01:13:57.917 --> 01:13:59.583
Clear Blue Sky!

923
01:14:20.667 --> 01:14:23.249
The terrible devastation and the tremorsâ€¦

924
01:14:23.250 --> 01:14:24.707
â€¦will roll over!

925
01:14:24.708 --> 01:14:25.708
Inosuke, youâ€¦

926
01:14:27.042 --> 01:14:29.082
Hey, is your stomach okay?

927
01:14:29.083 --> 01:14:30.499
Y-Yeah.

928
01:14:30.500 --> 01:14:32.792
Inosuke! Protect the passengers...!

929
01:14:34.958 --> 01:14:36.083
I canâ€™t die.

930
01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:40.417
If I die, that man would become a murderer.

931
01:14:40.792 --> 01:14:42.208
I canâ€™t dieâ€¦

932
01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:46.500
I wonâ€™t let anyone die!

933
01:15:13.833 --> 01:15:15.958
Are you okay, Santaro?!

934
01:15:18.417 --> 01:15:22.832
Get a grip! I was saved because the demonâ€™s flesh was so bouncy!

935
01:15:22.833 --> 01:15:24.833
What an irony!

936
01:15:25.333 --> 01:15:28.583
Is your stomach okay? Where you were stabbed?

937
01:15:29.167 --> 01:15:33.917
I-Iâ€™m fine. How about you?

938
01:15:34.167 --> 01:15:37.083
As energetic as usual! I can't even catch a cold!

939
01:15:38.083 --> 01:15:41.042
I donâ€™t think I can move any time soon.

940
01:15:42.292 --> 01:15:48.208
Save the others. There are many injured people.

941
01:15:49.542 --> 01:15:52.792
How about the driver near the neck?

942
01:15:55.333 --> 01:15:56.750
I think it is better if he dies.

943
01:15:58.042 --> 01:15:59.375
That's not goodâ€¦

944
01:16:00.125 --> 01:16:02.624
He stabbed you in the stomach, didn't he?!

945
01:16:02.625 --> 01:16:05.750
His leg got stuck and canâ€™t move.

946
01:16:06.333 --> 01:16:10.000
His leg is crushed so he canâ€™t walk. If left alone, he will die!

947
01:16:10.625 --> 01:16:14.000
If so, that means he already received his punishment.

948
01:16:14.792 --> 01:16:16.000
Please help him.

949
01:16:18.833 --> 01:16:19.833
I beg of you.

950
01:16:26.333 --> 01:16:30.333
Fine! Iâ€™ll go. Because Iâ€™m the boss!

951
01:16:30.917 --> 01:16:32.875
Because my minion asked me for help!

952
01:16:33.208 --> 01:16:36.667
After I save him, Iâ€™ll pluck out all his hair!

953
01:16:38.583 --> 01:16:40.875
You donâ€™t have to do thatâ€¦

954
01:16:45.708 --> 01:16:47.292
It's almost dawn.

955
01:16:49.333 --> 01:16:51.000
I must adjust my breathing.

956
01:16:52.292 --> 01:16:53.333
Hurry.

957
01:16:54.167 --> 01:16:55.250
We have toâ€¦

958
01:16:56.167 --> 01:16:57.208
â€¦save the injured.

959
01:16:59.417 --> 01:17:04.125
Nezuko, Zenitsu, Rengokuâ€¦

960
01:17:05.625 --> 01:17:09.292
They will be fine. I have to believe it!

961
01:17:16.375 --> 01:17:20.292
My body is falling apart. I can't regenerateâ€¦

962
01:17:21.417 --> 01:17:25.750
Did I lose? Am I going to die? Am I?

963
01:17:26.333 --> 01:17:31.292
Noâ€¦ It canâ€™t be. I havenâ€™t unleashed my full power!

964
01:17:31.833 --> 01:17:34.250
I couldnâ€™t devour even a single human.

965
01:17:34.583 --> 01:17:39.792
My plan to fuse with the train and devour all the humans at once was ruined.

966
01:17:40.583 --> 01:17:42.875
And I ended up like this.

967
01:17:43.542 --> 01:17:46.625
After spending all that time and effortâ€¦

968
01:17:47.542 --> 01:17:50.833
Itâ€™s him! Itâ€™s all because of him!

969
01:17:51.375 --> 01:17:54.625
Even though I had two hundred passengers as my hostages,

970
01:17:54.833 --> 01:17:58.125
I was still suppressed. I was defeated.

971
01:17:58.667 --> 01:18:00.833
This is the power of the Hashira.

972
01:18:01.708 --> 01:18:04.417
That guyâ€¦ he sure was fast.

973
01:18:04.833 --> 01:18:07.542
Even though he couldn't break my spell!

974
01:18:07.917 --> 01:18:12.457
And that girl! Isn't she supposed to be a demon?

975
01:18:12.458 --> 01:18:14.791
A demon who hunts other demons?

976
01:18:14.792 --> 01:18:17.917
Why didn't Muzan kill her?

977
01:18:19.542 --> 01:18:24.291
Darn it. Darn it! When it happened,

978
01:18:24.292 --> 01:18:28.417
after that brat broke through my spell, it started to weaken.

979
01:18:29.042 --> 01:18:31.000
It's all that brat's fault!

980
01:18:31.708 --> 01:18:35.250
I just want to kill him, no matter how.

981
01:18:35.833 --> 01:18:41.292
Oh, and that boar too. If only I could kill it.

982
01:18:42.167 --> 01:18:48.417
That boar got in my way. His senses are abnormally sharp and he's sensitive to my gaze.

983
01:18:49.958 --> 01:18:53.500
Did I lose? Am I going to die?

984
01:18:54.333 --> 01:18:59.375
This is a nightmare. A nightmare!

985
01:19:00.625 --> 01:19:05.624
The Lower Rank Demons are always being killed by demon slayers.

986
01:19:05.625 --> 01:19:10.666
Upper Rank Demons have not changed for the last hundred years.

987
01:19:10.667 --> 01:19:15.874
They got rid tons of demons. They even got rid of Hashira within the Demon Slayer Corps.

988
01:19:15.875 --> 01:19:18.542
Are our strengths simply worlds apart?

989
01:19:19.333 --> 01:19:24.167
Even after receiving so much blood, I still wasn't on par with the upper ranks.

990
01:19:26.458 --> 01:19:29.624
I want to start overâ€¦ I want to start over.

991
01:19:29.625 --> 01:19:34.458
What a miserable nightmare this is.

992
01:19:42.375 --> 01:19:45.042
It seems you can perform Total Concentration: Constant.

993
01:19:45.250 --> 01:19:46.542
Impressive!

994
01:19:48.042 --> 01:19:49.250
Rengoku.

995
01:19:50.167 --> 01:19:52.375
Thatâ€™s the first step to becoming a Hashira!

996
01:19:53.250 --> 01:19:56.625
There are about a thousand steps one might need to take in order to become a Hashira.

997
01:19:57.542 --> 01:19:58.667
I'll do my best.

998
01:20:00.083 --> 01:20:01.458
You are bleeding internally.

999
01:20:02.458 --> 01:20:05.458
Focus more and increase your breathing accuracy.

1000
01:20:06.042 --> 01:20:09.000
Spread your nerves to every corner of your body.

1001
01:20:09.958 --> 01:20:13.042
Thereâ€™s a blood vessel. The torn blood vessel.

1002
01:20:17.250 --> 01:20:18.417
Focus more.

1003
01:20:30.250 --> 01:20:33.417
Right there. Now, stop it. Stop the bleeding.

1004
01:20:39.042 --> 01:20:40.042
Focus.

1005
01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:52.125
Yes! You stopped the bleeding.

1006
01:20:52.625 --> 01:20:56.208
By mastering your breathing, you will be able to do various things.

1007
01:20:56.958 --> 01:20:58.792
Not everything, though.

1008
01:20:59.458 --> 01:21:03.000
You can definitely be stronger than before.

1009
01:21:04.708 --> 01:21:05.708
Yes.

1010
01:21:07.958 --> 01:21:09.042
Everyone is safe!

1011
01:21:09.625 --> 01:21:12.250
There are many injured, but their lives are not in danger.

1012
01:21:13.625 --> 01:21:16.792
Donâ€™t exert yourself and rest your body.

1013
01:21:21.792 --> 01:21:23.125
Thank you so much.

1014
01:21:24.208 --> 01:21:25.208
Right.

1015
01:21:52.917 --> 01:21:57.583
An Upper Rank 3? What is he doing here?!

1016
01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:12.624
Flame Breathing.

1017
01:22:12.625 --> 01:22:13.625
Second Form.

1018
01:22:15.708 --> 01:22:17.000
Rising Scorching Sun!

1019
01:22:27.375 --> 01:22:28.625
Nice sword.

1020
01:22:31.292 --> 01:22:32.667
He regenerates fast.

1021
01:22:33.125 --> 01:22:37.000
What an oppressive, terrible aura. So, this is an Upper Rank Demon?

1022
01:22:38.125 --> 01:22:41.250
I don't understand why you would target a wounded person.

1023
01:22:42.833 --> 01:22:46.958
I thought he would get in the way of our conversation.

1024
01:22:47.417 --> 01:22:49.500
And what would we talk about?

1025
01:22:50.042 --> 01:22:53.542
It is my first time meeting you but I already hate you.

1026
01:22:54.417 --> 01:22:58.542
Really? I hate weak humans too.

1027
01:22:58.875 --> 01:23:01.167
Weaklings make me sick.

1028
01:23:02.083 --> 01:23:06.000
It seems we have different moral values.

1029
01:23:07.500 --> 01:23:10.042
Then I have a great proposal for you.

1030
01:23:10.833 --> 01:23:12.875
How about you become a demon too?

1031
01:23:13.583 --> 01:23:14.583
No way.

1032
01:23:15.375 --> 01:23:19.833
I knew it the instant I saw you. From your strength, you must be a Hashira?

1033
01:23:20.417 --> 01:23:25.292
That fighting spirit of yours is refined and you are getting closer to the supreme realm.

1034
01:23:26.042 --> 01:23:29.292
I am the Flame Hashira, Kyojuro Rengoku.

1035
01:23:30.250 --> 01:23:31.875
I am Akaza.

1036
01:23:32.625 --> 01:23:38.417
Kyojuro, Iâ€™ll tell you why you havenâ€™t crossed into the supreme realm.

1037
01:23:39.083 --> 01:23:43.667
Because you are a mere human. You will grow old and die eventually.

1038
01:23:45.625 --> 01:23:47.750
Become a demon, Kyojuro.

1039
01:23:48.833 --> 01:23:51.707
If you do, for a hundred or even two hundred years,

1040
01:23:51.708 --> 01:23:55.083
you can continue training and become stronger.

1041
01:23:56.625 --> 01:24:01.125
Of all the demons I've encountered to date, he has the strongest smell similar to Kibutsuji.

1042
01:24:01.833 --> 01:24:03.792
I must back Rengoku up!

1043
01:24:04.833 --> 01:24:10.667
Growing old and dying is what gives meaning and beauty to the fleeting span of a human life.

1044
01:24:11.542 --> 01:24:17.500
It's precisely because we age and die that our lives have value and nobility.

1045
01:24:19.583 --> 01:24:24.000
Strength is not a word that means much with regards to the flesh.

1046
01:24:28.542 --> 01:24:32.833
This boy is not weak. Do not insult him.

1047
01:24:34.042 --> 01:24:38.417
I'll say it again, we have different moral values.

1048
01:24:39.625 --> 01:24:42.958
I wonâ€™t become a demon no matter what.

1049
01:24:48.500 --> 01:24:49.750
Is that so?

1050
01:24:51.958 --> 01:24:53.375
Technique Development.

1051
01:24:55.542 --> 01:24:57.250
Destructive Death: Compass Needle.

1052
01:25:12.917 --> 01:25:15.125
If you donâ€™t want to be a demon, Iâ€™ll kill you.

1053
01:25:29.583 --> 01:25:31.875
My eyesâ€¦ can't keep up!

1054
01:25:32.333 --> 01:25:35.917
Of all the Hashira I've killed, there was no Flame Hashira.

1055
01:25:36.917 --> 01:25:39.875
Moreover, they all refused my proposal.

1056
01:25:44.458 --> 01:25:50.292
Why? As someone who also chose the path of physical combat, I can't understand.

1057
01:25:51.167 --> 01:25:54.292
It is said that only the chosen ones can be demons.

1058
01:25:59.542 --> 01:26:03.458
For one with such great talent to waste away in an unsightly mannerâ€¦

1059
01:26:04.083 --> 01:26:06.292
I can't bear to watch that!

1060
01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:10.875
Just die, Kyojuro. While you are still young and strong!

1061
01:26:13.625 --> 01:26:14.917
Destructive Death.

1062
01:26:16.417 --> 01:26:17.417
Air Type.

1063
01:26:30.917 --> 01:26:31.917
I get it now.

1064
01:26:34.208 --> 01:26:35.500
Flame Breath.

1065
01:26:36.042 --> 01:26:37.042
Fourth Form.

1066
01:26:37.583 --> 01:26:39.458
Blooming Flame Undulation.

1067
01:26:41.625 --> 01:26:44.833
When he hit the void with his fist, the attack reached me.

1068
01:26:47.958 --> 01:26:49.917
He is moving at the speed of flash.

1069
01:26:56.333 --> 01:27:00.667
If we keep fighting at this distance, cutting off his neck might be difficult.

1070
01:27:01.333 --> 01:27:02.333
If soâ€¦

1071
01:27:07.958 --> 01:27:09.167
I have to get closer!

1072
01:27:10.500 --> 01:27:12.875
What incredible reaction speed!

1073
01:27:15.750 --> 01:27:20.292
This wonderful sword technique will be gone too, Kyojuro!

1074
01:27:20.625 --> 01:27:22.041
Arenâ€™t you sad?

1075
01:27:22.042 --> 01:27:25.875
It happens to everyone. If we are human, thatâ€™s only natural!

1076
01:27:27.292 --> 01:27:28.292
Donâ€™t move!

1077
01:27:28.917 --> 01:27:32.542
If your wound reopens, it will be fatal! Stand back, that's an order!

1078
01:27:33.792 --> 01:27:36.124
Ignore the weakling, Kyojuro!

1079
01:27:36.125 --> 01:27:37.917
Unleash your full power!

1080
01:27:41.208 --> 01:27:43.208
Focus on me.

1081
01:27:55.083 --> 01:27:56.833
Nice move.

1082
01:28:02.875 --> 01:28:04.124
Rengoku!

1083
01:28:04.125 --> 01:28:05.708
Googly Eyes!

1084
01:28:09.125 --> 01:28:11.333
Become a demon, Kyojuro.

1085
01:28:15.667 --> 01:28:19.750
Then fight me forever and let us spur each other on.

1086
01:28:24.042 --> 01:28:26.125
You have what it takes.

1087
01:28:28.833 --> 01:28:29.833
I refuse.

1088
01:28:29.917 --> 01:28:33.292
Iâ€™ll say it once more, I hate you.

1089
01:28:36.875 --> 01:28:38.542
I wonâ€™t be a demon.

1090
01:28:39.583 --> 01:28:40.583
Flame Breath.

1091
01:28:42.417 --> 01:28:43.542
Third Form.

1092
01:28:44.250 --> 01:28:46.167
Flame Spirit of All Creation.

1093
01:28:48.958 --> 01:28:51.333
Great, how wonderful!

1094
01:28:52.667 --> 01:28:55.208
Destructive Death: Air Type.

1095
01:29:03.542 --> 01:29:09.332
There is no opening; I can't jump in. I canâ€™t keep up with their speed!

1096
01:29:09.333 --> 01:29:12.374
The surroundings of those two are at a completely different level.

1097
01:29:12.375 --> 01:29:16.042
I feel as if I'd only die if I went at their pace.

1098
01:29:16.625 --> 01:29:21.958
I know I'd only be a hindrance if I tried to assist. Thatâ€™s why I canâ€™t move!

1099
01:29:25.167 --> 01:29:26.167
Rengokuâ€¦

1100
01:29:31.292 --> 01:29:32.917
You still don't understand, do you?

1101
01:29:33.375 --> 01:29:38.500
By continuing to attack me, you're choosing death, Kyojuro!

1102
01:29:48.083 --> 01:29:50.958
Flame Breathing. First Form: Unknowing Fire.

1103
01:29:53.417 --> 01:29:55.541
Itâ€™s regrettable to kill you here.

1104
01:29:55.542 --> 01:29:58.583
Your physical condition is not at its peak.

1105
01:30:04.208 --> 01:30:05.458
Second Form.

1106
01:30:06.417 --> 01:30:08.250
Rising Scorching Sun.

1107
01:30:09.708 --> 01:30:13.082
In a year or two, your technique would be more refined.

1108
01:30:13.083 --> 01:30:14.417
Your accuracy would also improve!

1109
01:30:26.792 --> 01:30:28.042
Third Form.

1110
01:30:28.292 --> 01:30:30.083
Flame Spirit of All Creation!

1111
01:30:31.250 --> 01:30:34.417
Fourth Form: Blooming Flame Undulation!

1112
01:30:36.667 --> 01:30:38.042
Destructive Death.

1113
01:30:39.917 --> 01:30:41.125
Fifth Form.

1114
01:30:41.833 --> 01:30:43.125
Flame Tiger!

1115
01:30:46.625 --> 01:30:47.958
Disorder.

1116
01:30:52.042 --> 01:30:53.417
Kyojuro!

1117
01:31:09.458 --> 01:31:12.833
Did he do it? Did he win?

1118
01:31:41.583 --> 01:31:43.292
No way.

1119
01:31:49.458 --> 01:31:50.750
It can't be!

1120
01:31:58.500 --> 01:32:00.375
Let's fight some more.

1121
01:32:01.833 --> 01:32:03.792
Don't die, Kyojuro.

1122
01:32:20.208 --> 01:32:21.292
Rengoku.

1123
01:32:22.542 --> 01:32:23.667
Rengokuâ€¦

1124
01:32:26.375 --> 01:32:27.500
Rengoku!

1125
01:32:32.792 --> 01:32:38.833
Even if your goal of fighting me is just to wound me, itâ€™s no use, Kyojuro.

1126
01:32:40.208 --> 01:32:46.125
The wonderful slash you inflicted on me has already healed.

1127
01:32:46.792 --> 01:32:48.167
But what about you?

1128
01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:53.667
A crushed left eye, crushed ribs, injured internal organs.

1129
01:32:53.833 --> 01:32:55.750
They can't heal in an instant.

1130
01:32:56.375 --> 01:32:59.499
But if you were a demon, you would heal in a blink of an eye.

1131
01:32:59.500 --> 01:33:03.082
To a demon, those are mere scratches.

1132
01:33:03.083 --> 01:33:06.542
In spite of all your efforts, a human canâ€™t defeat a demon.

1133
01:33:09.583 --> 01:33:11.417
I want to help!

1134
01:33:14.375 --> 01:33:16.375
But my arms and legs feel weakâ€¦

1135
01:33:17.208 --> 01:33:21.583
It could be due to my injury, but I'm always in this state after using Hinokami Kagura.

1136
01:33:35.833 --> 01:33:38.125
Kyojuro, youâ€¦

1137
01:33:39.958 --> 01:33:41.083
Iâ€¦

1138
01:33:42.542 --> 01:33:44.708
I will fulfill my duty!

1139
01:33:45.167 --> 01:33:48.333
I won't let anyone here die!

1140
01:33:50.125 --> 01:33:53.167
I will slash him to the root in an instant.

1141
01:33:53.750 --> 01:33:56.375
Flame Breathing. Esoteric Art.

1142
01:34:02.750 --> 01:34:05.124
What a wonderful fighting spirit.

1143
01:34:05.125 --> 01:34:09.625
Despite his injuriesâ€¦ Such drive, and force of will!

1144
01:34:10.333 --> 01:34:12.500
That flawless stance!

1145
01:34:15.458 --> 01:34:19.207
As I thought, you have to be a demon, Kyojuro!

1146
01:34:19.208 --> 01:34:20.541
With me, foreverâ€¦

1147
01:34:20.542 --> 01:34:22.042
Letâ€™s keep fighting!

1148
01:34:22.625 --> 01:34:26.500
Burn your heart. Push the limits.

1149
01:34:28.083 --> 01:34:29.750
I am the Flame Hashira,

1150
01:34:30.458 --> 01:34:32.417
Rengoku Kyojuro!

1151
01:34:32.875 --> 01:34:34.250
Ninth Form.

1152
01:34:34.833 --> 01:34:36.500
Rengoku!

1153
01:34:36.792 --> 01:34:39.292
Destructive Death: Annihilation Type.

1154
01:34:56.708 --> 01:34:58.958
Rengoku!

1155
01:35:31.333 --> 01:35:32.458
Rengoku.

1156
01:35:37.833 --> 01:35:39.000
Rengoku!

1157
01:35:41.792 --> 01:35:45.083
There he is! Renâ€¦goku.

1158
01:35:56.333 --> 01:35:59.583
Die! You'll end up dead, Kyojuro!

1159
01:35:59.833 --> 01:36:01.374
Become a demon!

1160
01:36:01.375 --> 01:36:03.582
Say that you will become a demon!

1161
01:36:03.583 --> 01:36:04.583
You areâ€¦

1162
01:36:04.584 --> 01:36:07.875
â€¦destined to be strong!

1163
01:36:20.583 --> 01:36:21.583
Kyojuro.

1164
01:36:21.958 --> 01:36:23.250
Yes, Mother!

1165
01:36:24.542 --> 01:36:28.792
Mother will ask you something now, and I want you to think carefully.

1166
01:36:29.833 --> 01:36:34.583
Do you know why were you born stronger than others?

1167
01:36:39.125 --> 01:36:40.125
I do not know!

1168
01:36:41.083 --> 01:36:43.500
So that you can help those who are weak.

1169
01:36:45.292 --> 01:36:49.875
Those who are born with greater talents than others,

1170
01:36:50.458 --> 01:36:56.042
must use their power for the sake of the world and people.

1171
01:36:57.208 --> 01:36:59.417
To use the power blessed by the heavens...

1172
01:36:59.875 --> 01:37:04.833
for hurting others or selfish gain would be unforgivable.

1173
01:37:06.250 --> 01:37:11.292
Helping the weak is the responsibility of those who are born strong.

1174
01:37:12.083 --> 01:37:20.458
It is a mission that must be fulfilled responsibly. Always remember that.

1175
01:37:21.125 --> 01:37:22.125
Yes!

1176
01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:42.625
Mother cannot stay any longer.

1177
01:37:44.042 --> 01:37:48.083
I was happy to be the mother of a strong and gentle child as you.

1178
01:37:50.667 --> 01:37:52.375
The rest is up to you.

1179
01:38:05.625 --> 01:38:07.291
Mother!

1180
01:38:07.292 --> 01:38:12.167
I feel the same. It is an honor for me to be birthed by a lady as yourself.

1181
01:38:20.458 --> 01:38:21.542
He stopped me.

1182
01:38:21.875 --> 01:38:24.042
What incredible power!

1183
01:38:24.167 --> 01:38:27.542
My right arm has already pierced through his solar plexus!

1184
01:38:29.125 --> 01:38:32.333
Darn it! It's almost dawn.

1185
01:38:33.125 --> 01:38:35.375
Unless I kill him and leave here soonâ€¦

1186
01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:39.208
My arm isâ€¦ stuck?!

1187
01:38:41.667 --> 01:38:43.208
I wonâ€™t let you go!

1188
01:38:50.667 --> 01:38:53.708
No matter what Rengoku told me,

1189
01:38:55.500 --> 01:38:58.208
I have to do it.

1190
01:38:59.167 --> 01:39:03.792
I have to cut off the demon's neck and fast!

1191
01:39:06.542 --> 01:39:10.500
The dawn is breaking! The sun's rays are approaching!

1192
01:39:11.333 --> 01:39:14.500
I must escape! I must escape!

1193
01:39:24.125 --> 01:39:29.250
I wonâ€™t let you go, that's for sure! Until I cut off your neck!

1194
01:39:32.042 --> 01:39:34.458
Move!

1195
01:39:38.708 --> 01:39:40.583
Inosuke, move!

1196
01:39:41.375 --> 01:39:44.208
Move, for Rengoku's sake!

1197
01:39:48.042 --> 01:39:52.542
Beast Breathing. First Fang: Pierce!

1198
01:40:10.958 --> 01:40:14.042
I have to hurry to a place with no sunlight.

1199
01:40:24.333 --> 01:40:25.333
What a pain.

1200
01:40:25.958 --> 01:40:28.042
I have to get away from the sun at once!

1201
01:40:35.167 --> 01:40:36.875
Don't you escape!

1202
01:40:37.458 --> 01:40:41.208
Donâ€™t run away, you coward! Donâ€™t go anywhere!

1203
01:40:43.667 --> 01:40:49.208
What is that brat talking about? Are his brains clogged up or what?

1204
01:40:49.750 --> 01:40:54.874
Iâ€™m not running away from Demon Slayers Corps. Iâ€™m running away from the sun.

1205
01:40:54.875 --> 01:40:58.125
Moreover, the battle has already been concluded!

1206
01:40:58.375 --> 01:41:01.750
He will soon be out of strength and die!

1207
01:41:04.333 --> 01:41:06.416
We Demon Slayers Corpsâ€¦

1208
01:41:06.417 --> 01:41:10.749
â€¦are always fighting in the midst of the darkness and night that favours you lot!

1209
01:41:10.750 --> 01:41:12.957
We are mere human beings!

1210
01:41:12.958 --> 01:41:18.083
Our wounds donâ€™t heal easily! Our lost limbs wonâ€™t return!

1211
01:41:18.917 --> 01:41:24.582
Donâ€™t run away, you damned idiot! Damned idiot! You coward!

1212
01:41:24.583 --> 01:41:31.124
Compared to the likes of you, Rengoku is so much better! He is stronger!

1213
01:41:31.125 --> 01:41:35.207
And Rengoku didn't lose! He didnâ€™t let anybody die!

1214
01:41:35.208 --> 01:41:38.707
He fought till the end! He protected us till the end!

1215
01:41:38.708 --> 01:41:42.832
You are the loser! Rengokuâ€¦

1216
01:41:42.833 --> 01:41:44.708
â€¦won!

1217
01:42:19.375 --> 01:42:21.333
You can stop yelling now.

1218
01:42:27.417 --> 01:42:31.667
Your stomach wound has opened up, and your injury is not minor, either.

1219
01:42:33.167 --> 01:42:37.625
If you wound up dead, I would have lost.

1220
01:42:40.042 --> 01:42:41.125
Rengokuâ€¦

1221
01:42:42.708 --> 01:42:46.375
Come here, and let us talk for the last time.

1222
01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:10.500
I remembered something when I saw an old dream.

1223
01:43:12.125 --> 01:43:16.083
My home. You should go to the Rengoku family home.

1224
01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:20.958
There should be notes left by Flame Hashira for successive generations.

1225
01:43:23.292 --> 01:43:25.000
My father read those a lot,

1226
01:43:26.333 --> 01:43:29.417
but Iâ€™ve never read them so I donâ€™t know the contents.

1227
01:43:31.708 --> 01:43:36.375
And about the Hinokami Kagura that you mentionedâ€¦

1228
01:43:37.667 --> 01:43:39.750
Perhaps there are some notes on that.

1229
01:43:41.208 --> 01:43:44.999
Ren-Rengoku, it doesnâ€™t matter anymore.

1230
01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:49.625
Please stop the bleeding with breathing. Is there any way to close the wound?

1231
01:43:50.333 --> 01:43:53.708
No. I will soon die.

1232
01:43:56.125 --> 01:43:59.417
I will talk while I still can, so listen up.

1233
01:44:01.708 --> 01:44:06.999
I want you to tell this to my little brother, Senjuro.

1234
01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:11.333
Tell him to follow the path that his heart thinks is right.

1235
01:44:13.917 --> 01:44:18.542
Tell my father that he should take care of his body.

1236
01:44:20.958 --> 01:44:24.417
And also, Kamado boy.

1237
01:44:27.042 --> 01:44:32.667
I believe in your little sister. I recognise her as a member of the Demon Slayers Corps.

1238
01:44:35.375 --> 01:44:41.541
I saw that young lady protecting the humans on the train while covered in her own blood.

1239
01:44:41.542 --> 01:44:45.832
She fights the demon with her life on the line. She protects humans.

1240
01:44:45.833 --> 01:44:49.208
No matter what people may say, she is a member of the Demon Slayers Corps.

1241
01:44:50.542 --> 01:44:52.042
Stand tall and be proud.

1242
01:44:57.417 --> 01:45:01.833
No matter how weak or unworthy you feel,

1243
01:45:04.250 --> 01:45:05.667
keep your heart burning,

1244
01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:11.125
grit your teeth and move forward.

1245
01:45:12.792 --> 01:45:18.042
If you just curl up in a ball and hide, time will pass you by.

1246
01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:22.250
It won't stop for you while you wallow in your grief.

1247
01:45:24.417 --> 01:45:26.875
Do not fret over my death here.

1248
01:45:27.792 --> 01:45:31.542
For us Hashira, being a shield for our juniors is only natural.

1249
01:45:32.875 --> 01:45:36.708
As Hashira, we would do the same for anyone.

1250
01:45:37.750 --> 01:45:39.542
To protect the young.

1251
01:45:41.250 --> 01:45:42.250
Kamado boyâ€¦

1252
01:45:44.250 --> 01:45:45.625
Boar head boy...

1253
01:45:46.750 --> 01:45:48.167
Blond boy...

1254
01:45:49.500 --> 01:45:51.542
Keep growing.

1255
01:45:52.542 --> 01:45:58.292
And in the future, you guys will be the pillars of the Demon Slayers Corps.

1256
01:45:59.333 --> 01:46:04.167
I believe that. I believe in you guys.

1257
01:46:30.125 --> 01:46:31.750
Motherâ€¦

1258
01:46:36.208 --> 01:46:38.417
Have I done well?

1259
01:46:40.583 --> 01:46:46.417
Did I fulfill my responsibilities?

1260
01:46:55.833 --> 01:46:58.083
You did a wonderful job.

1261
01:47:34.792 --> 01:47:39.875
When the train was derailed, Rengoku unleashed several techniques.

1262
01:47:40.958 --> 01:47:44.875
He kept damage to the carriages to a minimum.

1263
01:47:47.125 --> 01:47:48.458
He did, didn't he?

1264
01:47:50.292 --> 01:47:52.292
Did he really die?

1265
01:47:52.958 --> 01:47:55.167
Is it true that an Upper Rank Demon showed up?

1266
01:47:56.042 --> 01:47:57.042
Yes.

1267
01:47:57.833 --> 01:48:03.542
Why would an Upper Rank show upâ€¦ was he that strong?

1268
01:48:04.250 --> 01:48:05.250
Yesâ€¦

1269
01:48:07.833 --> 01:48:09.458
It was so frustrating.

1270
01:48:11.375 --> 01:48:19.167
As soon as I thought I could do something, it was as if a thick barrier soon appeared before me.

1271
01:48:21.167 --> 01:48:28.958
Great individuals are fighting in places farther away, where I still can't reach.

1272
01:48:30.875 --> 01:48:36.250
For someone like me who is struggling here, would I ever...

1273
01:48:39.458 --> 01:48:43.083
Would I ever become someone like Rengoku?

1274
01:48:53.917 --> 01:48:56.375
Don't say such feeble words!

1275
01:48:58.250 --> 01:49:02.666
Whether you can or can't, donâ€™t talk trash like that!

1276
01:49:02.667 --> 01:49:07.624
He said that he believed in us, and we only need to respond in kind!

1277
01:49:07.625 --> 01:49:11.375
All creatures return to the land when they die, and that's that!

1278
01:49:11.958 --> 01:49:14.874
Getting all worked up wouldn't bring him back!

1279
01:49:14.875 --> 01:49:17.791
Even if you are frustrated, don't cry!

1280
01:49:17.792 --> 01:49:23.667
No matter how miserable or humiliated you are, you have to live on!

1281
01:49:24.125 --> 01:49:26.249
Arenâ€™t you crying too?

1282
01:49:26.250 --> 01:49:29.542
You're crying so much that tears are spilling from your headgear.

1283
01:49:30.125 --> 01:49:32.500
Iâ€™m not crying!

1284
01:49:43.042 --> 01:49:45.750
Come here, it's time for training!

1285
01:50:29.833 --> 01:50:33.083
I see, Rengoku isâ€¦

1286
01:50:53.833 --> 01:50:58.250
Even Rengoku was defeated by an Upper Rank Demon, huh?

1287
01:51:03.625 --> 01:51:05.250
I donâ€™t believe it.

1288
01:51:12.333 --> 01:51:14.333
Namu Amida Butsu.

1289
01:51:21.042 --> 01:51:25.292
I will annihilate all unsightly demons.

1290
01:51:33.333 --> 01:51:34.333
I see.

1291
01:51:44.292 --> 01:51:48.792
Two hundred passengers were safe, all thanks to one individual.

1292
01:51:49.750 --> 01:51:54.042
Kyojuro did his best. He was a great child.

1293
01:51:55.708 --> 01:52:00.833
I don't feel lonely at all. I won't live that long either.

1294
01:52:03.708 --> 01:52:07.582
In the near future, I will go to where Kyojuro and the others have gone:

1295
01:52:07.583 --> 01:52:10.167
To the underworld.

1296
01:52:22.042 --> 01:52:23.167
Rengoku.

1297
01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:26.500
Rengoku.

1298
01:52:29.208 --> 01:52:31.208
Rengoku!
