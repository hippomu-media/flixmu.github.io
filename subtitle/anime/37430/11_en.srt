1
00:00:00,447 --> 00:00:05,168
Beyond a Fiction that nobody knows,

2
00:00:05,168 --> 00:00:10,523
here I open a nameless Story!

3
00:00:23,394 --> 00:00:28,030
The sky above holds a tomorrow brimming with hope

4
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:33,355
My days were vauge as I'm wondering What's the name?

5
00:00:33,355 --> 00:00:37,919
It took my far-reaching dream that kept me standing in awe

6
00:00:37,919 --> 00:00:43,079
along with my despair and consume them all away

7
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:47,534
My voice has been engraved by the shape of my wish

8
00:00:47,534 --> 00:00:52,051
Make it stronger, stronger, even stronger!

9
00:00:52,051 --> 00:00:55,205
Fly high!

10
00:00:56,906 --> 00:01:01,928
Beyond a Fiction that nobody knows,

11
00:01:01,928 --> 00:01:06,960
There's a slowly sprouting impulse of Skill to stay alive

12
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:11,823
If what I feel right now is Reality, then it will surely be a proof someday

13
00:01:11,823 --> 00:01:16,742
Each one of your story, I shall give a name to it

14
00:01:16,742 --> 00:01:22,053
to the east, to the west, to the high stand up to the period!

15
00:01:22,053 --> 00:01:24,645
Let's go!

16
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:34,860
It's been a few days since Benimaru and his comrades joined us.

17
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:38,990
This stuff sure is nice.

18
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:43,160
So this is silk cloth, Shuna?

19
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:48,670
Yes, the Hellmoth cocoons it's made from are full of magicules,

20
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:50,290
so it's very sturdy.

21
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,790
I see.

22
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:54,400
So it should give us some good protection.

23
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,020
That's amazing!

24
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:58,890
You can already weave silk?

25
00:01:58,890 --> 00:01:59,930
Great Rimuru!

26
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:00,980
Hiya.

27
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:02,050
Hey there.

28
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:04,270
He still won't talk!

29
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:07,520
You came to see us, Great Rimuru!

30
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,240
Y-Yeah. How're things going?

31
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:15,310
Great. The weaving loom Sir Kaijin made for me is very easy to use.

32
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:16,690
Yeah? Glad to hear it.

33
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:19,610
I'm counting on you to make clothes for everyone.

34
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:22,370
Of course! Leave it to me!

35
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:25,480
Now then, let us go, Great Rimuru.

36
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,430
Our lunch will get cold.

37
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:28,460
Shion...

38
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:32,000
Is your secretarial work going well?

39
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:34,250
Of course, Princess Shuna.

40
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:37,670
Shion declared herself my secretary.

41
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:40,230
She kinda looks like one, so I accepted.

42
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:43,220
Now, she's both my secretary and my bodyguard.

43
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:48,480
I wouldn't mind taking care of Great Rimuru myself.

44
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,940
Oh, no, Princess. There's no need for that.

45
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:54,480
I will take good care of him.

46
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:57,500
These two seem to have a rivalry going on...

47
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:02,320
I think I'll take care of Great Rimuru, after all.

48
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:04,280
No, as his secretary, I'll do that.

49
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:11,870
Great Rimuru, would you prefer to have me or Shion serving you?

50
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:16,520
W-Well... You need to be weaving silk, right?

51
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:19,130
Maybe I'll have you help out in your spare time...

52
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:21,470
What the heck am I asking for?!

53
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,470
Very well!

54
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:27,110
You're asking for my help, then?

55
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:29,350
E-Exactly! I'm counting on you!

56
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:32,390
Seriously, what the heck am I asking for?!

57
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:35,930
Well, then, please leave Great Rimuru to me.

58
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:40,540
Oh, hello, Great Rimuru.

59
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:43,080
Have you come to eat?

60
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:46,940
Yeah. Shion said she cooked me a meal.

61
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:53,080
Want to join me, guys?

62
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:56,470
Oh, I'm not really hungry...

63
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:58,810
Yes, we'll just have tea.

64
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:00,000
I will...

65
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:04,260
Oh, he can use the Body Double skill now?

66
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:07,370
...go out and scout the surrounding area!

67
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:14,300
I'll bring it out, then.

68
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:15,480
Oh... Sure.

69
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:24,140
I wonder why the guys reacted that way...

70
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:28,960
Is it because, even though Shion looks really capable,

71
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,910
it's going to end up being that old trope?

72
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,290
I've returned!

73
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:37,630
Please, help yourself.

74
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:39,290
She's not capable at all!

75
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:45,220
"Not hungry," my ass!

76
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:48,290
They ran away because they knew she couldn't cook!

77
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:50,470
Great Rimuru, help yourself.

78
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:52,470
Hey, you! Look at me!

79
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:54,650
How dare you just casually sip that tea?!

80
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:57,570
And the old geezer's totally erased his presence!

81
00:04:57,570 --> 00:04:58,770
Hey!

82
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:00,360
Go on, Great Rimuru.

83
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,920
Forgive me, Great Rimuru.

84
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,580
Consider this training.

85
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:05,790
Whew, I'm starved!

86
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:07,490
Please, before it gets cold.

87
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,450
H-Here I go, then.

88
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:14,620
Yes!

89
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:18,380
Well, hey, it's not like it's poison.

90
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:19,890
I won't die or—

91
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:28,130
Okay, relax. It looks like it's possessed, but it's just my imagination!

92
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:30,510
Right, it's just... that!

93
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:33,020
A simulacrum.

94
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:37,520
The tendency to see a face in anything with three distinctly visible points.

95
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:40,150
Uh, I don't need that explanation right now.

96
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:47,030
Help me, Great Sage!

97
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:48,160
Answer.

98
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:53,290
If you close your eyes and insert the spoon at an angle from the right, you will not die.

99
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:56,410
I don't really get it, but okay!

100
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:58,410
Mrgh!

101
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:00,410
"Mrgh"?

102
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:24,320
Oh, dear.

103
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,320
-Shion... -Y-Yes?!

104
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:30,600
Next time you make food to serve to someone else,

105
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,200
get Benimaru's approval first.

106
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:35,450
That's just cruel, Great Rimuru!

107
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:38,290
Don't blame me. You're her supervisor now.

108
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:41,570
I need Benimaru to do a good job

109
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:45,770
so we don't suffer any more losses like Gobta.

110
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:54,830
Gabiru the Lizardman continued to earn the cooperation

111
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:57,420
of other nearby Goblin villages.

112
00:06:57,420 --> 00:07:00,480
Granted, it wasn't so much Gabiru's persuasion

113
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:05,980
as it was the Goblins willingly capitulating in fear of the Orc invasion.

114
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:11,660
This gives us a total of 7,000 Goblins.

115
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:14,810
Way to go, Sir Gabiru! You're a great negotiator!

116
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:15,920
Not at all.

117
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:19,580
It just so happens my best efforts are being rewarded.

118
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:23,430
Don't be so humble! It's pure talent!

119
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:26,670
Yeah! Be more confident in yourself!

120
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:27,690
Indeed.

121
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:30,620
You will be the Lizardman chieftain one day, after all.

122
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:32,220
R-Right...

123
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:36,560
Maybe... I really am pretty great!

124
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:40,480
So, where are we headed next?

125
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,900
Are there any more villages around here?

126
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:45,740
It seems there is one more settlement.

127
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:50,230
But the residents of the previous village had odd things to say about it.

128
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:51,570
Odd things?

129
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:55,800
They said it was a settlement of Goblins that have tamed Direwolves.

130
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,370
What? Goblins and Direwolves?

131
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:00,070
That's impossible.

132
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:01,080
I agree.

133
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:05,450
What's more, they said the leader of these Goblins is a slime.

134
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:06,500
What?!

135
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:09,410
I don't quite understand that scenario...

136
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:12,650
But if that's the case, then if that slime works for us,

137
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:15,340
we'll be able to control the Direwolves, too!

138
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,430
Oh!

139
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:17,550
Two birds with one stone!

140
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:19,930
What profound thinking!

141
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:21,890
I'm glad I came along with you!

142
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,550
Just leave everything to me!

143
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:27,150
Yeah, Sir Gabiru! Say it!

144
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:34,150
Gabiru! Gabiru! Gabiru! Gabiru!

145
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:38,530
Really? You just decide the best heat level for tempering by instinct?

146
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:42,330
Sure do. I can tell from the color of the flame.

147
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:44,580
I always measure it...

148
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:47,550
I measure it the second time around, too.

149
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:51,080
Right, if the outside's cold, it won't be pliable.

150
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:54,590
Kurobe and Kaijin hit it off immediately.

151
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:58,450
They've been talking about this technical stuff for two hours now.

152
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,930
Oh, I can tell you what the best dirt is.

153
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:07,740
I came to check in on them, but I couldn't find the right moment to excuse myself,

154
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:09,120
so here I am.

155
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,060
Right?

156
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:11,850
Isn't forging fascinating?

157
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:12,940
Y-Yeah...

158
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:15,360
So about the water you use when tempering...

159
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,050
Is Great Rimuru in here?

160
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:18,200
Nice timing!

161
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:20,240
What's up, Rigurd?

162
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,920
Great Rimuru, an envoy of the Lizardmen has arrived.

163
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:29,390
Great Rimuru.

164
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:33,220
Would you mind if we accompanied you?

165
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:35,260
We want to know what the Lizardmen are up to.

166
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:36,930
Of course.

167
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:38,760
Now, then...

168
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:42,220
Are we dealing with friend or foe here?

169
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:50,740
Which one's the envoy?

170
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:03,670
That's a rather dramatic entry...

171
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:11,040
Hup!

172
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:18,840
I am Gabiru of the Lizardmen.

173
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,900
You will all serve under me.

174
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:24,220
Consider this a great honor!

175
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:25,630
Yeah, Sir Gabiru!

176
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:26,510
You're the best!

177
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:27,600
So cool!

178
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,810
You're on fire!

179
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:30,560
Huh?

180
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:34,640
Remember him well.

181
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:39,110
This is the man who will be the next chieftain of the Lizardmen!

182
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:40,110
Bow down!

183
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:42,010
Huh?

184
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,600
"You will serve under me"?

185
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,160
"Consider it an honor"?

186
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:49,930
Bigshot! Who does he think he is?

187
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:51,065
And...

188
00:10:51,065 --> 00:10:53,100
Shion-san, please stop!

189
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:56,210
You're gonna make this slime way too slim!

190
00:10:57,210 --> 00:10:59,340
I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

191
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:00,590
Ahem.

192
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:04,750
Forgive me... You called yourself Gabiru, yes?

193
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:07,730
This request to serve you is rather sudden...

194
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:11,430
Good grief. Must I spell it out for you?

195
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:13,610
You've heard the news, have you not?

196
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:14,500
What news?

197
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:19,780
The news that those Orc pigs are invading the Great Forest of Jura.

198
00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:21,660
Oh?

199
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:25,160
Which is why it would best suit you to become my men.

200
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:31,920
I, Gabiru, will protect you weaklings from the threat of the Orcs!

201
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:34,080
Weaklings!

202
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:37,280
Weaklings...

203
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,980
Weaklings?

204
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:41,470
Wow...

205
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:45,730
I don't see any Goblins.

206
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:47,160
What?

207
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:49,870
This was supposed to be a Goblin village.

208
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:52,875
In fact, I don't see anyone weak around here...

209
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:55,400
Well, if Orcs are invading,

210
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:59,750
I guess forming a united front with the Lizardmen is one option...

211
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,600
But I'm not sure I want him watching my back.

212
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,870
He seems pretty stupid.

213
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:12,430
"What one should really fear is not a competent enemy, but an incompetent ally."

214
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:14,370
Didn't Napoleon say that?

215
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:17,380
Ahem!

216
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:21,720
I've heard that there are those among you who have tamed Direwolves.

217
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:24,472
I will make those of you who have officers in my army.

218
00:12:24,472 --> 00:12:26,220
Bring them to me.

219
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:31,020
Uh-oh... Shion's getting pissed again!

220
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:34,270
Can I kill him?

221
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:35,980
Sure!

222
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:38,730
Wait, no! No! No!

223
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:43,700
Um... We didn't exactly tame the Direwolves.

224
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:46,200
We made them our allies, and I'm the one who did that.

225
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:49,240
A slime did that? Please don't make such jokes.

226
00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:52,410
Ranga.

227
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:53,690
Yes, master!

228
00:12:57,490 --> 00:13:00,660
He says he wants to talk to you. Hear him out.

229
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:02,439
As you wish.

230
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,100
Wait, was he always that big?

231
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:11,340
That's his true size.

232
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:15,140
This size works better for intimidating people, you know?

233
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:18,710
My master has ordered me to hear what you have to say.

234
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,400
So speak. I'm listening.

235
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:24,900
Are you the leader of the Direwolves?

236
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:29,930
Wow... The other guys are cowering in fear,

237
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:32,750
but this guy seems to have some guts.

238
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:34,200
Still seems stupid, though.

239
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:37,990
Your beautiful fur, your keen eyes...

240
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:40,960
You truly have a majestic presence.

241
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:41,960
However...

242
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:46,060
It is a bit disappointing to know that your master is a slime!

243
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:47,220
What?!

244
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:52,250
It seems you've been deceived.

245
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:56,060
Very well. What this slime has done to you is unforgivable...

246
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:58,520
so I shall defeat him for you!

247
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,160
Sir Gabiru, you're awesome!

248
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,590
Show 'em what you're made of, Sir Gabiru!

249
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:03,650
The peerless Gabiru!

250
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:04,690
Say it!

251
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:12,120
Gabiru! Gabiru! Gabiru! Gabiru!

252
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:17,620
A mere lizard dares to insult my master?!

253
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:19,120
Uh-oh.

254
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:21,220
He's dead.

255
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:29,630
Hey, what're you guys doing?

256
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:30,720
Gobta!

257
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,720
You're still alive?

258
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,890
Hey, that's kinda mean.

259
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:36,780
Of course I'm alive!

260
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:37,560
Notice.

261
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:40,010
It appears that, in order to counteract Shion's cooking,

262
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:41,770
he has gained the Poison Resistance skill.

263
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:43,500
Oh...

264
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:46,400
Even I don't have Poison Resistance. I'm impressed.

265
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,690
Really?

266
00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:49,990
Good timing.

267
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:50,830
Huh?

268
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:57,030
What the heck is going on?!

269
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:00,760
Lizard, if you can defeat this one,

270
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:02,640
I will consider your offer.

271
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,235
Why me?!

272
00:15:04,235 --> 00:15:07,420
Wow, Ranga! He's being so calm about this!

273
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:10,500
Yeah, of course. If you fought him, you'd kill him.

274
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,190
Fine by me.

275
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:15,100
Having one of your subordinates fight saves you the shame of losing.

276
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:18,350
Wouldn't you agree, slime?

277
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:22,200
Gobta, don't hold back! Get him!

278
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,730
Jeez, why the heck am I doing this?

279
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:28,350
If you win, I'll have Kurobe make a special weapon just for you!

280
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:31,110
Really? That motivates me a little!

281
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:32,990
And if you lose, you have to eat Shion's cooking!

282
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:34,620
Anything but that!

283
00:15:35,170 --> 00:15:38,550
For some reason, this conversation makes me very unhappy.

284
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:45,260
Sir Gabiru!

285
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:46,670
Are you ready?

286
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,760
Then begin!

287
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:54,549
Gabiru! Gabiru! Gabiru!

288
00:15:54,549 --> 00:15:57,680
We Lizardmen, descendants of the great Dragons,

289
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,600
could never lose to a mere Hobgoblin...

290
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,110
How dare you?!

291
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,030
Impossible! He disappe—

292
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,880
I can't believe what I'm seeing!

293
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:31,300
Is Gobta actually using Shadow Movement?

294
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:39,510
That's that.

295
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:42,390
The fight is over! The winner is Gobta!

296
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:43,270
Yes!

297
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:44,030
Well done!

298
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:45,150
All right!

299
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:51,231
Bravo! Bravo!

300
00:16:51,231 --> 00:16:52,790
This is pretty high!

301
00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:57,030
Nice work, Gobta. I knew I saw promise in you.

302
00:16:57,410 --> 00:17:01,540
Well done showing them what a Hobgoblin can do!

303
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:03,370
I misjudged you.

304
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:08,290
I'll pretend I didn't hear that rude comment you made about me earlier.

305
00:17:08,690 --> 00:17:12,230
Looks like he's gotten stronger since he fought us.

306
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:15,800
It appears he has talent that would be worth nurturing.

307
00:17:16,830 --> 00:17:20,640
Is he actually some sort of prodigy?

308
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:24,720
Also, did everyone just naturally believe Gobta would win?

309
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,795
I thought...

310
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:28,560
You will regret...

311
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:30,640
...injuring one of ours!

312
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,210
You made the first move, didn't you?

313
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:36,860
...they'd pick a fight over it and end up beating the snot out of that guy.

314
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:42,870
It's okay. I'm a guy who can pick up on the mood.

315
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:44,780
I'll pretend I expected this to happen.

316
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:46,540
Good job, Gobta.

317
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:49,160
As promised, I'll have Kurobe make you a weapon.

318
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,840
All right!

319
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:53,720
As for all of you, Gobta has won this battle!

320
00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:59,960
If you want us to help you fight the Orcs, we'll consider it,

321
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,600
but we won't serve you.

322
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:04,440
Take him and leave for today.

323
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:08,000
W-We'll be back!

324
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,520
Indeed. This is not over!

325
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:12,650
We...

326
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:15,760
We'll remember this!

327
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:19,280
Okay, then...

328
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,680
I guess we'll have to plan where to go from here.

329
00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:43,370
I saw 200,000 Orcs.

330
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:47,060
The main army is moving north along the river.

331
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:52,500
Based on the movements of this army and a detached force,

332
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,793
I expect they will regroup in the marshlands east of here.

333
00:18:54,793 --> 00:18:59,090
In the Lizardmen's territory, you mean?

334
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:02,320
Two hundred thousand, huh?

335
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:05,490
That's such a huge number, it's hard to even imagine it.

336
00:19:10,130 --> 00:19:13,180
Just what is it the Orcs are after?

337
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:19,170
Orcs are not very intelligent monsters.

338
00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:23,320
If there's something behind this invasion other than just instinct,

339
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:26,550
we should suspect there's someone backing them.

340
00:19:27,010 --> 00:19:28,430
Someone backing them?

341
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,570
Like a Demon Lord, perhaps?

342
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:38,800
If that Gelmud guy who came to your village is involved in this...

343
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:44,130
Well, there's no proof to base that on right now.

344
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:50,350
And even if it is a Demon Lord, it might not be the one that made Shizu-san suffer.

345
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:56,550
I don't know if a Demon Lord is involved, but...

346
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:57,420
But?

347
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:01,930
I think this makes it much more likely that an Orc Lord has appeared.

348
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:06,160
The unique monster that only appears once every few centuries?

349
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,240
Yes.

350
00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:12,190
I can't imagine an ordinary Orc leading an army of 200,000.

351
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:18,110
I believe caution would be wiser than optimism in this case.

352
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:19,150
I agree.

353
00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:22,197
What is it?

354
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:25,850
One of the body doubles I had scouting the area has made an encounter.

355
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:27,026
An encounter?

356
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:30,330
They request an audience with you.

357
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:31,610
How shall I respond?

358
00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:32,860
Who is it?

359
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:37,530
I already had my fill of Gabiru, so I'd rather not meet anyone weird.

360
00:20:37,530 --> 00:20:40,270
I don't believe this one is... weird...

361
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:42,560
But it is a highly unusual encounter.

362
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:45,760
It's... a Dryad.

363
00:20:47,090 --> 00:20:48,350
A Dryad?!

364
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:53,850
Aren't those the girls you see in a lot of games who are, like, tree spirits?

365
00:20:54,540 --> 00:21:00,410
Hasn't it been several decades since the last time a Dryad showed itself?

366
00:21:00,410 --> 00:21:02,900
F-Fine! Bring her here!

367
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:03,610
Sir.

368
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:28,900
Ruler of monsters, and all those who are loyal to him,

369
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:31,620
forgive me for this unannounced visit.

370
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:36,580
I am Treyni, a Dryad.

371
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,890
It is a pleasure to meet you.

372
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:46,950
I'm Rimuru Tempest... um, Treyni-san.

373
00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:49,610
So what brings you here?

374
00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:52,990
I have come to request a favor.

375
00:21:52,990 --> 00:21:54,237
A favor?

376
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:58,730
Rimuru Tempest, ruler of monsters,

377
00:21:58,730 --> 00:22:03,000
I would like you to defeat the Orc Lord.

378
00:22:17,124 --> 00:22:22,904
Why is it only those who have hope

379
00:22:22,904 --> 00:22:28,401
To fall into despair from the bottom of their heart?

380
00:22:28,401 --> 00:22:33,325
Why is it only those who have courage

381
00:22:33,325 --> 00:22:39,267
To be wounded at the end of their honor?

382
00:22:39,267 --> 00:22:44,984
I don't want to close my eyes in face of sadness

383
00:22:44,984 --> 00:22:50,613
The dawn for new tomorrow was a mere dream to me

384
00:22:50,613 --> 00:22:56,385
Then I see a light falling through the crack of the night

385
00:22:56,385 --> 00:23:02,836
The sky is crying

386
00:23:03,341 --> 00:23:08,905
I don't know what is there at the corner of the world

387
00:23:08,905 --> 00:23:14,521
All I want is to protect those within my reach

388
00:23:14,521 --> 00:23:20,740
Staring at the only reason to fight

389
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:27,926
We who believe the answer to be forgiveness...

390
00:23:27,926 --> 00:23:32,680
Must not lose!

391
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:39,070
Next time, "The Gears Spin Out of Control."
