1
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:06,360
A city of monsters, home to a slime that bested the Orc Lord...

2
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:08,970
Can this be true?

3
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:11,930
No, I know it's true.

4
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:13,550
I simply can't believe it.

5
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:17,050
But I have to believe it.

6
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:21,750
This slime called Rimuru has saved us.

7
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24,050
True.

8
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:27,700
What sort of relationship should we seek with them?

9
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:31,750
And should we do so on the assumption that this slime is benevolent,

10
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:34,590
or should we perceive him as a threat and attempt to eliminate him?

11
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:38,260
You speak of eliminating him so easily, but is it even possible?

12
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,600
Shall I give you an honest answer?

13
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,230
I don't even need to hear it.

14
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:50,480
I suppose we should go and meet him once.

15
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:55,240
I will judge this Rimuru with my own two eyes.

16
00:00:56,410 --> 00:00:58,160
All right, let's move out.

17
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:02,040
We're going to go see this slime you three met.

18
00:01:14,414 --> 00:01:19,981
In the night you could count stars in the sky

19
00:01:19,981 --> 00:01:25,479
The overflown drop reflects the swaying world

20
00:01:25,479 --> 00:01:31,376
All life are in ambivalence

21
00:01:31,376 --> 00:01:36,172
And it twinkles as the days goes by

22
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:42,764
Both short-lived flowers and devastating winds

23
00:01:42,764 --> 00:01:47,016
are the sign of the passing present

24
00:01:47,811 --> 00:01:53,802
To those who live in the moment, this song shall reach you

25
00:01:53,802 --> 00:02:01,892
It will push you to the limits of freedom, telling you to survive

26
00:02:01,892 --> 00:02:04,667
We will find the way

27
00:02:04,667 --> 00:02:13,000
We returners all equally carry a seed of hope

28
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:19,503
Under the whim of miracle, Birth and Demise shall join hand

29
00:02:19,503 --> 00:02:23,562
and the time will flow once again

30
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:41,670
This is delicious!

31
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:44,260
I love all the food in this town!

32
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:46,270
Give me more!

33
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,270
Were you okay yesterday?

34
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:56,800
Nothing to worry about! I—

35
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,830
...am quite tough, you know!

36
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:01,030
That's Sir Gabiru for you! So cool!

37
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:04,530
Did your communication crystal work okay?

38
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:07,970
Yes. I was able to contact King Gazel.

39
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:12,040
I informed him that the Demon Lord Milim attacked and you dealt with her.

40
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:13,180
Good!

41
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:16,160
We'll just see how things go with Milim for now.

42
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:18,200
Be sure to give me a report.

43
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:19,476
Of course.

44
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:22,680
This is Great Rimuru's healing potion.

45
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:27,680
99% of its composition is extracted from hipokute herbs.

46
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,810
You can drink it or apply it on a wound!

47
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:33,690
The potion of total recovery: full potion!

48
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:40,780
In contrast, Dwarven techniques can only extract up to 98%.

49
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:43,990
The potions we can make are "high potions."

50
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:48,410
A mere 1% makes a tremendous difference in potency.

51
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:55,120
And now, at last, I've overcome that 1% barrier!

52
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,410
This is the result of my research!

53
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:02,140
Oh? All right, I'll appraise it.

54
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:04,840
Please do.

55
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:08,330
Great Sage, use Appraisal.

56
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:09,960
Answer.

57
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:13,560
This potion is equal to a full potion.

58
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:17,640
Well done, Vesta! It's definitely a full potion!

59
00:04:18,770 --> 00:04:20,780
Excellent work, Vesta!

60
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:23,280
Assisting you in this endeavor was truly worthwhile!

61
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:25,640
Way to go, Vesta!

62
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:29,840
I knew you were the right man for this kind of research!

63
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,290
Thank you... Thank you.

64
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:36,550
Wow, I really didn't think he'd be able to make it.

65
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:38,920
Now, if we move forward with mass production...

66
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:40,860
I think if we sold this,

67
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:43,420
it'd be a great source of funds for Tempest. What do you say?

68
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:49,870
I don't think that's gonna be easy.

69
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,560
This potion is too effective.

70
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:56,060
We can't rely on it for everyday use.

71
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:56,960
Fine quality like this

72
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:01,820
is best reserved for high-level champions in life-or-death situations.

73
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:04,060
That's true.

74
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,960
The potions sold in the Dwarven Kingdom are low potions,

75
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,492
which are mass-produced by diluting high potions.

76
00:05:11,492 --> 00:05:14,680
What do you say to negotiating with King Gazel

77
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:17,170
to have those low potions produced here in Tempest?

78
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:19,650
Hey, that could work!

79
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:22,010
If we produce and sell the potions here,

80
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:26,550
the Dwarven Kingdom would only need to procure the necessary ingredients.

81
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:30,180
I get it. That would benefit both nations, huh?

82
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:33,110
Okay. Let's bring that up for negotiation.

83
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:36,380
You guys can continue with the production here.

84
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:37,290
Yes, sir!

85
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:56,950
What's going on?

86
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:59,080
A new guest arrived in town,

87
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:01,540
and Lady Milim took exception to him.

88
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:03,420
Let me through.

89
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,310
Rigurd, are you okay?

90
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:12,400
G-Great Rimuru, it's you!

91
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,172
Huh?!

92
00:06:13,172 --> 00:06:16,330
This is no cause for concern at all!

93
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:17,430
No way! That's serious!

94
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:25,831
This is who did that to you?

95
00:06:25,831 --> 00:06:26,750
Correct.

96
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:28,430
Oh, Rimuru!

97
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:29,384
Yikes.

98
00:06:29,384 --> 00:06:34,490
This guy thought he could mock us, so I taught him a lesson!

99
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:39,340
I am one of Demon Lord Carrion's Three Beastketeers,

100
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:41,210
Phobio the Black Leopard Fang.

101
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:44,670
I am the strongest warrior of the Beast King's Beastketeers.

102
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,740
Nice town you've got here.

103
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:50,800
Fit to be ruled by the Beast King, don't you think?

104
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:52,050
Surely you jest—

105
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:07,900
The Demon Lord Milim?!

106
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:11,990
Leopard Fang Flaming Palm!

107
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:15,990
What do you think you're doing to my bestie's subordinate?!

108
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:24,500
I think she expects me to praise her.

109
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:27,750
And, um...

110
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:30,010
Should I really be praising her for this?

111
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:38,040
I doubt she'll get away with doing this to an underling of this Demon Lord Carrion.

112
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:43,270
Didn't you promise not to cause any commotion without my permission?

113
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,380
Huh?!

114
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:46,280
Er, well...

115
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:48,980
Y-Yeah! This is different!

116
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:52,030
He's not from this town, so it doesn't count!

117
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:52,960
It does count.

118
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,030
Huh?!

119
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:58,030
But since you did stand up for Rigurd,

120
00:07:58,030 --> 00:07:59,790
I'll just make you go without lunch today.

121
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:03,620
That's cruel... That's too cruel!

122
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,080
This is all his fault!

123
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,590
This scumbag!

124
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:10,800
One hit wasn't enough! At least give me one more—

125
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,260
Wait! Wait! Wait!

126
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:18,660
So, why did you come here?

127
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:23,560
Hmph. You expect me to answer a lowly slime?

128
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:28,860
You may call me "lowly," but I'm stronger than you.

129
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,730
I don't know this Demon Lord Carrion.

130
00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:37,321
Depending on how you behave, my people could become Carrion's enemies.

131
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:42,266
Do you want to be solely responsible for antagonizing the entire Great Forest of Jura?

132
00:08:42,266 --> 00:08:44,210
Hah! That's big talk.

133
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:47,500
This whole town is loyal to a lowly monster like you?

134
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,750
Must be rough having nothing but weaklings around.

135
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:53,010
Don't get a big head just because Lady Milim took a liking to you.

136
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:56,890
Hey! Are you talking trash about my friend?

137
00:08:57,950 --> 00:09:01,680
Milim, stop. If you do anything else, you can kiss dinner goodbye.

138
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:06,010
Okay. I'll be quiet.

139
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:09,690
Now, it's true that I'm a slime.

140
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:13,850
But it's also a fact that I rule 30% of this forest,

141
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:17,570
and if you're really serious, we may have no choice but to declare war.

142
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:20,690
So think carefully before you answer me.

143
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:28,080
Lord Carrion ordered me to come here and scout some mysterious majin to serve him.

144
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,590
Oh? He must mean us.

145
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:36,590
Looks like Milim wasn't the only Demon Lord who had an eye on that battle.

146
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:40,100
Damn that Carrion! He broke his promise!

147
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:48,430
Well, I get the picture.

148
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:49,820
You can leave now.

149
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:50,440
Huh?

150
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,320
Great Rimuru...

151
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:53,070
Are you sure about this?

152
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,910
Well, I can't kill him, can I?

153
00:09:57,010 --> 00:09:58,950
Tell the Demon Lord Carrion

154
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:03,580
that if he wants to talk, he can choose a date and contact us again.

155
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,960
I'll make you regret this.

156
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:21,300
Doesn't look like he'll relay any message for us...

157
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:26,730
Okay, I want to know all about this Demon Lord Carrion.

158
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,960
I can't tell you that.

159
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:32,690
We've sworn not to interfere with each other.

160
00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:35,820
And there it is! She just confessed that there's some secret!

161
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:39,100
Did you only make that promise with Carrion?

162
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:41,860
Or does it involve other Demon Lords, too?

163
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:43,490
Uh, that's...

164
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:45,280
Hey, it's okay!

165
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:48,370
Carrion used his underling to interfere with you, didn't he?

166
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:52,710
And we're besties, so we help each other out, right?

167
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:58,630
So I think it'd be a good idea for me to know about the other Demon Lords.

168
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:04,680
If I don't know what kind of promise you made,

169
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:07,940
I might end up interfering without realizing it.

170
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:09,970
That's true...

171
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:12,020
But... Besties...

172
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:13,060
I know!

173
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:16,110
I'll make a weapon for you!

174
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:19,030
I'm concerned for you as your bestie, after all!

175
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:21,030
A new weapon?!

176
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:23,030
Yeah, that's right!

177
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:26,280
Nothing's more important than your bestie!

178
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:29,600
Too easy. She's way too easy.

179
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:36,040
Demon Lords Clayman, Carrion, Frey,

180
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:41,120
and you, Milim, used Gelmud in a scheme to create a puppet Demon Lord.

181
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:44,120
It was just a way to kill time.

182
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,630
Maybe that's all it was to you,

183
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:50,760
but since we butted in, I guess it's inevitable that they'd target us.

184
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:54,470
It seems likely that other Demon Lords will become involved, as well.

185
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:56,330
What a predicament...

186
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:58,820
We must consult with Lady Treyni.

187
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:00,540
It'll be fine!

188
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:03,740
Great Rimuru has nothing to fear from any of those Demon Lords!

189
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:07,290
Well, I've told you the secret.

190
00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:11,540
Now give me my new weapon, like you promised, bestie!

191
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:15,750
The storm that arose along with Demon Lord Milim's attack

192
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:17,960
would gain strength along its path

193
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:21,560
to swallowing up Rimuru's nation and his people.

194
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:28,010
One of the nations surrounding the Great Forest of Jura, the Kingdom of Falmuth,

195
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:32,540
is a major trade power known as the gateway to the Western Provinces.

196
00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:35,060
It was from this kingdom

197
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:37,859
that a team was sent to the Forest of Jura to learn about the Orc Lord.

198
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:41,070
Led by a man named Youm,

199
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:44,570
they're a rowdy gang, brought together by money.

200
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:55,940
-Boss— -Shh.

201
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:03,010
Whoa, this is bad!

202
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:03,830
But, but...

203
00:13:03,830 --> 00:13:06,430
You guys... Whoa! Watch it!

204
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:10,180
How have you three stayed alive so long by being this careless?!

205
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:13,600
Sounds like some people have encountered a monster.

206
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,480
What should we do, boss?

207
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:21,070
Hey! Wait for us!

208
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:23,990
Sorry to butt in!

209
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:25,140
We appreciate the help!

210
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:26,540
Sorry about this!

211
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:27,500
Here it comes!

212
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,620
A Knight Spider?!

213
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:35,290
All right, boys, assume formation.

214
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:38,170
Remove and heal anyone who gets hurt.

215
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:40,760
This is an order! Everyone stay alive!

216
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:41,670
Yeah!

217
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,610
Kajir, take command.

218
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:44,660
Got it.

219
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:47,560
Rommel, use a strengthening spell on me.

220
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:54,118
And you guys...

221
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:58,670
I'll make you pay for getting us involved in this later.

222
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,460
Hey, Kaval! Is that you?

223
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:08,950
Good to see you again!

224
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:10,420
Gobta!

225
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:13,820
You're fighting monsters every time I see you.

226
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:16,040
Do you enjoy fighting that much?

227
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:18,860
But I'll handle this one.

228
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:21,790
You're for dinner today!

229
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,700
You're kidding me...

230
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,550
These things are seriously delicious, you know!

231
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,390
It'll be ready soon!

232
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:38,230
I can't wait!

233
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:44,110
I'm the representative of this town... or nation...

234
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:47,740
called the Jura Tempest Federation. My name's Rimuru Tempest.

235
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:49,910
You really are a slime!

236
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:55,490
By the way, Rimuru, there are some folks here we didn't see last time.

237
00:14:55,630 --> 00:15:00,260
Oh, yeah. This is Benimaru, Shion, Souei, and Shuna.

238
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:07,170
And that's Milim.

239
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:16,640
So, the Kingdoms of Blumund and Falmuth have both come to investigate this place?

240
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:18,730
-We are— -Wait a minute.

241
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:21,410
Why is a slime acting like such a bigshot?

242
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:22,620
It makes no sense!

243
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:24,140
What's the deal here?

244
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:26,682
Why are all of you okay with this?

245
00:15:26,682 --> 00:15:28,400
You are insulting Great Rimuru.

246
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,150
Shut your mouth, Tits!

247
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:32,610
-Boss! -Youm!

248
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:33,820
H-Hey...

249
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:34,900
I'm sorry!

250
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:38,807
Sorry about what Shion did.

251
00:15:38,807 --> 00:15:41,210
She has trouble restraining herself sometimes.

252
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:42,620
Cut her some slack.

253
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:46,500
That's mean! I'm actually known for my patience!

254
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:51,090
You've got a long way to go if you're that impatient, Shion!

255
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:55,570
You're so short-tempered because you don't have an open mind like I do.

256
00:15:55,570 --> 00:15:59,200
I want to be on good terms with Humans.

257
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:03,090
I hope we can trade and network with you all someday, too.

258
00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:04,180
Trade?

259
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:05,150
Yeah.

260
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:08,038
We've actually entered diplomatic relations with the Dwarven Kingdom already.

261
00:16:08,038 --> 00:16:09,685
With Dwargon?!

262
00:16:09,685 --> 00:16:14,050
I think passing through this land would be more convenient for your merchants.

263
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:15,300
What do you think?

264
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:16,940
Now, wait a minute!

265
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:20,480
You're saying that Dwargon acknowledges this nation of monsters as legitimate?

266
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:24,170
I can vouch for that.

267
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:26,080
Minister Vesta!

268
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:28,670
Former minister.

269
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:32,170
What is a man of your standing doing here?

270
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:35,148
It's good to see you again, Fuze.

271
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:38,290
What Great Rimuru says is true.

272
00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:43,180
King Gazel and Rimuru have entered into a treaty.

273
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,690
Are you convinced now?

274
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:53,700
W-Well... If that is the case, we aren't opposed to cooperating with you.

275
00:16:53,890 --> 00:17:00,850
But I'll need to see undeniable proof that you are, in fact, an ally of Humans.

276
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:02,080
I assume that's all right?

277
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:05,250
Oh, sure. That's to be expected.

278
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:06,890
I'm just fine with that.

279
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:08,610
I'll permit you to stay here.

280
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:11,290
I want you to understand that we aren't a threat.

281
00:17:12,450 --> 00:17:14,410
By the way, Fuze-san,

282
00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:18,600
has the news that the Orc Lord was defeated already gotten around?

283
00:17:18,870 --> 00:17:23,600
No, only our king and a select handful of people know that.

284
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:26,100
I see. In that case...

285
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:29,680
Youm-kun, want to make a contract with me?

286
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:32,250
Huh? What are you even talki—

287
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:37,590
What... might you be suggesting?

288
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:41,180
You said the Kingdom of Falmuth hired you with money, right?

289
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:43,750
So you'd just be switching employers.

290
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,550
To put it in simple terms...

291
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:51,420
I want you guys to be the champions who defeated the Orc Lord.

292
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,090
What?!

293
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:58,180
Just say that we simply helped you out,

294
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:03,770
and start a rumor that you were the one who defeated the Orc Lord.

295
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:05,670
I figure, that way,

296
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:11,830
I can be known as the trustworthy monster who assisted the champion.

297
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,990
I think it'll be easier to befriend people that way

298
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:17,990
than if they think I'm some mysterious, threatening monster.

299
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:19,080
What do you say?

300
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:20,480
I get it.

301
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,770
Well put.

302
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:32,000
Have you gathered your thoughts?

303
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:34,970
Rimuru... No, Mr. Rimuru.

304
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:39,910
This town is really something.

305
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:46,270
After seeing all of them, I know you're not some evil being.

306
00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:49,270
We are people of guilty conscience.

307
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:52,070
We always longed to be free men.

308
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:55,460
We accepted the mission to come here

309
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:58,200
because we planned to make everyone think we'd died on the way

310
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:01,080
and then head for some safe nation.

311
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,500
I've decided.

312
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,590
I'll trust you.

313
00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:14,010
Allow me to call you "Master Rimuru" from now on.

314
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:15,460
I am at your command.

315
00:19:15,810 --> 00:19:17,960
Sure. I'll be counting on you.

316
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:22,300
Thus, Youm and his companions began training under Hakurou

317
00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:26,070
to look like champions.

318
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:31,720
That didn't take long.

319
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:33,730
You weren't noticed, were you, Tear?

320
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:37,560
I'm part of the Moderate Harlequin Alliance, too, you know!

321
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:39,240
Have a little faith in me!

322
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:44,870
I'm just concerned you might go overboard.

323
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:50,750
Jeez! Stop treating me like a child already!

324
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:52,430
Very well.

325
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:56,060
I received word from Myulan.

326
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:59,880
It seems Milim has taken quite a liking to those majin.

327
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:01,470
Huh...

328
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:04,780
This is turning out to be more interesting than I expected.

329
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:06,930
How truly delightful.

330
00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:08,650
Well, that's great,

331
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:10,370
but what's really going on?

332
00:20:10,370 --> 00:20:13,650
Is this majin really so amazing that the Demon Lord Milim would take interest?

333
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:17,140
Only to the point that we mustn't simply ignore it.

334
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:19,750
He was no match for me, after all.

335
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:23,150
But then again, Laplace...

336
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,820
What about Laplace?

337
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:28,620
Shall we call it... an eeriness?

338
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:31,600
He says he felt something of that nature.

339
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,750
Oh, really?

340
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:37,920
If a cunning guy like Laplace said so, maybe there really is something!

341
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,180
At the very least,

342
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:42,950
I think we should find out why the Demon Lord Milim's taken such an interest.

343
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:47,930
Yes, we certainly will need to gather more information and give it some thought.

344
00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:50,510
Yeah, we should!

345
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:52,680
So, as for the results of my investigation!

346
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,230
Let's hear it.

347
00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:58,250
Well, Frey apparently has no interest in getting involved with the Forest of Jura.

348
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:00,230
She seemed wary of something.

349
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:03,550
It was almost as if she was preparing for battle!

350
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:05,740
And did you find out the reason for that?

351
00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:08,450
I did! You won't believe this!

352
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:11,580
She was freaking out, saying Charybdis was going to be revived!

353
00:21:12,810 --> 00:21:14,210
Charybdis?

354
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:18,560
I see.

355
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,460
Now, Tear, I have another task I'd like you to handle.

356
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,170
I thought you would!

357
00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:28,910
I've already called Footman, so a little fighting is no problem!

358
00:21:28,910 --> 00:21:30,730
That's wonderful, Tear.

359
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:34,840
But I would like you to avoid violence as much as possible.

360
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:37,960
First, seek out the location of the seal

361
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:42,790
and find out whether or not we can tame Charybdis.

362
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:44,810
Leave it to me, Clayman!

363
00:21:44,810 --> 00:21:46,740
-The location should be— -I said leave it to me!

364
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:49,400
Okay, I'm going now!

365
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:53,360
Charybdis, eh?

366
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:56,250
With power said to rival that of the Demon Lords...

367
00:21:56,920 --> 00:22:00,250
I truly look forward to seeing what it is like.

368
00:22:05,513 --> 00:22:12,394
I have to believe in me that you believe in

369
00:22:12,394 --> 00:22:20,858
A story just started, carrying a name

370
00:22:22,326 --> 00:22:29,050
Whether it's a concidence or a fate, who cares?

371
00:22:29,050 --> 00:22:34,787
Just pick one thing in here

372
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:42,242
Just from one chance, the future would change

373
00:22:42,242 --> 00:22:48,737
Along with the sky, the wind, and the land

374
00:22:48,737 --> 00:22:55,762
It's all because you keep believing in that possiblity

375
00:22:55,762 --> 00:23:02,315
That I can also keep believing. With my power...

376
00:23:02,315 --> 00:23:05,643
In the depths of the world that we must protect,

377
00:23:05,643 --> 00:23:08,997
rise up as many times as it take

378
00:23:08,997 --> 00:23:15,064
If I can't hold it with both hands, I'll lend it to you

379
00:23:15,674 --> 00:23:22,368
Even if you got shaken, face foward for the smile you wish to protect

380
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:27,294
There's a scenary I want to show you,

381
00:23:27,294 --> 00:23:29,815
let's go togehter

382
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:38,660
Next time, "Evil Creeps Closer."
