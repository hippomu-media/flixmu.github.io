1
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:04,050
Shizu's lingering wish, her regret,

2
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:06,707
that she entrusted to Rimuru,

3
00:00:06,707 --> 00:00:11,370
turned out to be children who'd been summoned here in an incomplete form.

4
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:14,700
Their bodies, not fully matured,

5
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:17,940
were unable to control the immense magicule energy within them.

6
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,450
Before long, that energy would go berserk,

7
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:24,540
destroying their bodies and dooming them to die.

8
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:31,130
Rimuru conjectured that the reason Shizu survived longer,

9
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:33,290
despite being summoned as a child herself,

10
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:37,920
may have been because Ifrit dwelled within her body, giving her control of that energy.

11
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,660
So, to save the children,

12
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:43,390
he decided to get superior spirits to inhabit their bodies.

13
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:48,670
Shizu-san, I swear I'm going to save these kids.

14
00:01:00,494 --> 00:01:06,061
In the night you could count stars in the sky

15
00:01:06,061 --> 00:01:11,559
The overflown drop reflects the swaying world

16
00:01:11,559 --> 00:01:17,456
All life are in ambivalence

17
00:01:17,456 --> 00:01:22,252
And it twinkles as the days goes by

18
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:28,844
Both short-lived flowers and devastating winds

19
00:01:28,844 --> 00:01:33,096
are the sign of the passing present

20
00:01:33,891 --> 00:01:39,882
To those who live in the moment, this song shall reach you

21
00:01:39,882 --> 00:01:47,972
It will push you to the limits of freedom, telling you to survive

22
00:01:47,972 --> 00:01:50,747
We will find the way

23
00:01:50,747 --> 00:01:59,080
We returners all equally carry a seed of hope

24
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:05,583
Under the whim of miracle, Birth and Demise shall join hand

25
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:09,642
and the time will flow once again

26
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:27,340
This is the entrance?

27
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:31,420
So the Dwelling of Spirits is right inside here.

28
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:34,880
Are you guys ready for this?

29
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,370
Once we go in, we may never come out.

30
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:42,030
O-Of course I'm ready!

31
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:42,740
Yes!

32
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:43,920
I'm fine.

33
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,700
I-I'm not scared at all!

34
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,920
Ranga, if anything happens, take care of them.

35
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,570
Your students are my students, Master.

36
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:03,370
I will protect them with my life!

37
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:04,100
Good.

38
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:07,200
Let's go.

39
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:27,020
It's just a straight path.

40
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:31,290
What the heck? For a labyrinth, this looks easy!

41
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:34,860
B-But something seems weird about it...

42
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:43,900
Whatever you do, don't wander away from the group.

43
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,740
R-Right!

44
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,230
It looks like a straight path,

45
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:52,190
but there are traps meant to confuse your sense of direction all over the place.

46
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:54,800
With human senses alone,

47
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:58,250
we might end up unable to either move forward or go back.

48
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:01,580
I'm glad I have my mental map.

49
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:14,490
What are those voices? Where are they coming from?

50
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,770
It sounds like they're resonating inside our heads.

51
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:22,610
Powerful thought transference... no, telepathy?

52
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:26,130
Not very amusing, visitors.

53
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:29,620
Be more afraid. Feel more fear!

54
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:39,100
Good, good! It's no fun for me if you show no fear!

55
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:42,630
Are you a spirit who lives here?

56
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:45,510
We need to talk to some superior spirits.

57
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:49,180
If possible, could you take us to them without impeding us?

58
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:54,480
What an amusing thing to say!

59
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:57,310
Of course, of course. I'll tell you.

60
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:59,420
Oh, that was easier than I expected.

61
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:03,010
But before that...

62
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:04,570
Before that?

63
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:08,140
Sensei, look...

64
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:24,510
Looks like an invitation to me.

65
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:27,000
I guess we'll have to go.

66
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:45,850
Hey, it's a dead end.

67
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:48,180
No rush, no rush.

68
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:49,910
Small World!

69
00:05:57,530 --> 00:05:59,860
Well? Amazing, don't you think?

70
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,620
Wow...

71
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,250
Now, it's time for your test!

72
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:17,930
Whether it's in an anime or a game,

73
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:21,590
the shady characters' eyes always glow red.

74
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:28,760
Hey, is our "test" to defeat this thing?

75
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:31,350
Ding-dong! That is correct!

76
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:35,460
Seriously? This'll be easy.

77
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:36,810
Shall I handle it?

78
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:39,940
No, you protect the kids for me.

79
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:42,410
If anything happens to me, get them out of here.

80
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,060
Right!

81
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,460
Sensei...

82
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:53,520
It'll be fine. Sensei's strong.

83
00:06:57,220 --> 00:07:00,020
What's this? What's this, what's this, what's this?

84
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:04,020
You're doing this alone? Overconfidence is a dangerous thing, you know.

85
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:10,470
Great Sage, Appraisal.

86
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:11,910
Answer.

87
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:14,650
It is a golem with a body made of magisteel.

88
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,340
Damn, this thing's intense.

89
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:19,660
Its magicule energy is off the charts.

90
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,450
It's even stronger than that thing from the other day.

91
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:25,210
What to do?

92
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,910
It looks pretty damn heavy, too...

93
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:39,310
Hey, what the hell?! It's trying to kill me!

94
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:41,170
How is this a "test"?!

95
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:46,970
Precisely! Get careless, and you're dead!

96
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:49,630
Think you can win? Think you can win?

97
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:52,070
I feel as though she's making fun of me...

98
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:56,270
It's definitely fast, but I can evade it easily.

99
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:58,580
The only question is how to defeat it...

100
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:06,960
Since it's made of metal, Black Thunder probably won't work.

101
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,800
The electric shock would run through the ground and wipe us all out.

102
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:12,420
I doubt I can cut it with a sword, either.

103
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:14,400
Should I use... that?

104
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,720
Sensei!

105
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:20,060
It's all right! There's nothing to worry about!

106
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:27,830
Hey! If you apologize now, I'll let you off the hook.

107
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:31,740
If you don't, I'll bust this thing up. Is that okay with you?

108
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:38,600
Interesting! Yes, of course! Of course!

109
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,230
Go ahead and try!

110
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:50,460
Arcane Thread Fetters!

111
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:57,590
What?! My Elemental Colossus!

112
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,220
Better say your goodbyes now.

113
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:05,230
Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh—

114
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:06,600
Hell Flare!

115
00:09:10,475 --> 00:09:11,980
I-Incredible!

116
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:16,490
I-It's nothing that special, but... Wow...

117
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:20,332
No! This can't be!

118
00:09:20,332 --> 00:09:21,450
It only took one hit?!

119
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:30,920
Well, that about does it.

120
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:32,980
Sensei, you're awesome!

121
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:33,990
Yeah! Yeah!

122
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:36,970
You really are as strong as Shizu-sensei!

123
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:39,010
Well, of course he could beat that thing!

124
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:40,850
Why are you talking tough, Alice?

125
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:46,210
Now, then...

126
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,440
If you don't want to be burned to a crisp, come on out here.

127
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:53,980
I can see where you're hiding.

128
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:55,060
Right!

129
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:57,690
Right, right, right, right...

130
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:05,260
Humiliating though it is, I have come in response to your call!

131
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:09,410
A Fairy?

132
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:11,250
She's cute...

133
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:12,380
Who are you?

134
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:13,880
Ta-da!

135
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,800
I am one of th—

136
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:18,068
-She bit her tongue. -That had to hurt.

137
00:10:18,068 --> 00:10:21,050
Must've been her first time speaking without telepathy in a while.

138
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:22,170
You okay?

139
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:23,560
I'm fine, I'm fine...

140
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:28,090
I am one of the Ten Great Demon Lords,

141
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:30,660
Ramiris of the Labyrinth!

142
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:32,190
A Demon Lord?

143
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:34,860
Know your place! You should be groveli—

144
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:35,800
Ow!

145
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:37,530
What the heck was that?!

146
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:39,110
-A chop? -Not the point!

147
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:41,620
How could you even be a Demon Lord, anyway?

148
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:44,110
If you're gonna lie, make it believable.

149
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:47,310
There's no way a kid like you could become a Demon Lord.

150
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:49,570
Don't call me a kid! How rude!

151
00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:51,750
What else could I be but a Demon Lord?!

152
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:53,090
An idiot?

153
00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:54,460
Who're you calling an idiot?!

154
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:55,460
A simpleton?

155
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,760
Right, right. I'm a simpleton.

156
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:58,330
Hey!

157
00:10:58,330 --> 00:11:00,480
Don't think just saying it politely makes it okay!

158
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,100
Hmm... I have a friend named Milim who's a Demon Lord,

159
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:07,770
and you look too weak to even compare to her.

160
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:09,410
Hmph! You moron!

161
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:12,560
Moron! Moron! Moron! Moron! Moron! You're a moron!

162
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:19,320
Now, listen... Milim is known to us as the Demon Lord of Absurdity.

163
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:22,610
She thinks she can just solve everything with strength.

164
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:27,370
It's beyond rude to compare my lovely self to that embodiment of absurdity!

165
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:30,420
I need you to understand that, or we'll have big problems!

166
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:31,440
Big problems!

167
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,880
Big! Problems!

168
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,670
Damn, she's obnoxious.

169
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:37,920
And isn't there something off about you, too?

170
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,970
What's your deal? How is it you can use a haphazard move like that?

171
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:43,390
I wish you wouldn't be so reckless!

172
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:46,270
Do you really know Milim?

173
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:48,140
We became friends recently.

174
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:51,070
Wait a minute...

175
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:56,020
Are you the slime that became the new leader of the Great Forest of Jura?

176
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:58,230
That's right. I'm impressed you know that.

177
00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:00,140
Oh! So it's true!

178
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:01,120
Sensei...

179
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,320
You're a slime?

180
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,810
Oh, yeah.

181
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,210
S-Sensei is...

182
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:08,530
...a slime?!

183
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:09,610
That's how it is.

184
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,410
Cute...

185
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:16,480
Sorry to surprise you.

186
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,680
Awesome!

187
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,453
You're a slime, but you're so strong!

188
00:12:19,453 --> 00:12:21,320
Th-That's not a big deal, okay?!

189
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,910
I guess anything goes! Amazing, Sensei!

190
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:26,470
I'll tell you all the details some other time.

191
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:28,720
Excuse me! Have you forgotten that I'm here?!

192
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:30,210
Sorry about that.

193
00:12:30,210 --> 00:12:32,550
So, how did you know about me?

194
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:35,840
Milim showed up here for the first time in ages,

195
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:38,430
bragging about how she'd found herself a "bestie."

196
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:41,480
I sneered at her then, but it turned out to be true!

197
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,530
If Milim was here,

198
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:47,770
maybe that means she wasn't lying about being a Demon Lord...

199
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:49,790
What's with that doubting look in your eyes?

200
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,260
You'd better believe I'm a Demon Lord!

201
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:54,040
She could tell I was doubting it...

202
00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:01,840
It's so good! Yep, so good!

203
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:05,050
She eats a ton. Where is she putting it all?

204
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:09,070
I never intended to kill you, or even hurt you.

205
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:10,260
Really, now?

206
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:11,430
Yes, really.

207
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:13,210
I just wanted to have a little fun scaring you,

208
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:16,760
and then gallantly save you, so you'd respect me!

209
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:17,820
What the heck?

210
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:19,690
Acting in my own play?

211
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:23,210
But then you actually destroyed my Elemental Colossus!

212
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:28,330
I finally completed it after fiddling so much with that toy I found!

213
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:32,290
What choice did I have? I thought it was kill or be killed.

214
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:36,500
Also, that thing was super sophisticated, you know!

215
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:39,410
I used earth spirits to control its weight,

216
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:41,400
water spirits to move its joints,

217
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,440
fire spirits to generate power,

218
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,800
and wind spirits to regulate heat, making it a composite of all the elements!

219
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,670
I made it using the very best spirit engineering!

220
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:53,330
Spirit engineering?

221
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,350
Could that be...

222
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:02,070
One of the projects he'd been under pressure to complete, the Magisoldier Project...

223
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,050
went up in smoke.

224
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:09,760
You mean the Magisoldier that the Dwarves and Elves

225
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,400
were working together to invent in Dwargon?

226
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:14,650
Ding-dong, ding-dong! So you know about that!

227
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:15,750
That project failed

228
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:20,140
because they couldn't produce the magicore that would serve as its heart.

229
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:23,150
Besides, there's no way it could've withstood spirit power

230
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:26,010
if it was made of normal steel.

231
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:28,430
After it went berserk and fell apart,

232
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:30,940
they threw out its shell, which I brought here and restored!

233
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:32,770
Could I be a genius?

234
00:14:32,770 --> 00:14:34,640
Aren't I amazing? Aren't I amazing?!

235
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:35,770
Obnoxious...

236
00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:38,540
That really is amazing, though.

237
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:43,520
She managed to complete the research that Vesta's team failed at.

238
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:46,040
She just looks like an idiot,

239
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:49,280
but this Demon Lord Ramiris might actually be amazing.

240
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,510
Okay. I get that you're amazing.

241
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:57,230
And having seen how amazing you are, I have a favor to ask.

242
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:01,460
Huh? A favor? Why should I do what you—

243
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:06,000
I'll listen! I'll listen! I feel like listening to you now!

244
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,040
It's good to be so accepting.

245
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:10,930
Of course, I won't ask you to do it for nothing.

246
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,680
If you'll help me, I'll whip up a new golem for you.

247
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,190
So start talking.

248
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:31,770
I explained everything about the kids to her, keeping nothing hidden.

249
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:34,500
That I wanted superior spirits to inhabit them

250
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,688
so they could control the energy within them,

251
00:15:36,688 --> 00:15:39,817
and that this was why I wanted to go to the Dwelling of Spirits.

252
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:42,080
I see.

253
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,410
Those kids have it pretty rough.

254
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:45,400
Right?

255
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:49,590
That's why I want you to introduce me to the Queen of Spirits.

256
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:50,640
Hmm?

257
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:52,980
Oh, didn't I tell you?

258
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:54,052
That's me.

259
00:15:54,052 --> 00:15:54,840
Huh?

260
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,850
I'm saying the Queen of Spirits

261
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:58,350
is me.

262
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,110
This is no time for joking aro—

263
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:08,160
Bzzt! It's no joke!

264
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,790
It's true!

265
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:11,380
Okay, look...

266
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:13,990
Why would a Demon Lord be Queen of Spirits?

267
00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:17,620
Bzzt again! You got it backwards!

268
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:18,760
Backwards?

269
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:22,552
The Queen of Spirits fell from grace to become a Demon Lord!

270
00:16:22,552 --> 00:16:24,760
Is "fell from grace" something you'd say about yourself?

271
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:26,880
Well, I did fall from grace.

272
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:31,010
It's so easy to fall...

273
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:35,660
Oh, come to think of it, he fell from grace, too.

274
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:36,510
"He"?

275
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,140
Leon-chan?

276
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:43,200
Apparently, he had something he wanted to look into,

277
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,890
so he called in a superior spirit from ancient times,

278
00:16:45,890 --> 00:16:49,070
and they forged a contract. Shocking, right?

279
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:50,820
So then I had no choice,

280
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:54,700
as Queen of Spirits, to recognize Leon-chan as a Hero

281
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:57,070
and grant him the divine protection of the spirits.

282
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:01,500
Hang on! Why did a guy who was declared a Hero become a Demon Lord?

283
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,720
He must have fallen from grace.

284
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:06,390
Maybe he copied me!

285
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:09,750
So you have to fall from grace to become a Demon Lord?

286
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:12,590
Of course, I could knock him out with one punch!

287
00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:15,530
Easy peasy. One punch, one punch!

288
00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:16,470
Liar.

289
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:21,310
Seriously, though, Heroes can become Demon Lords in this world?

290
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:24,580
Come to think of it, Leon-chan said something pretty outrageous.

291
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:28,270
He asked me to summon a specific individual from another world.

292
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:29,276
A specific one?

293
00:17:29,276 --> 00:17:31,750
As if that's even possible! What a moron!

294
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:33,100
He looked like he might cry!

295
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:35,880
No, he did cry! It's not a stretch to say he cried!

296
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:39,620
Pretty impudent for such a crybaby! That moron! Just one punch! One punch!

297
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:43,810
I'm not too sure,

298
00:17:43,810 --> 00:17:49,130
but this Demon Lord Leon might be more trouble than I thought.

299
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,350
But seriously, is this chick gonna be okay?

300
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:55,040
Won't Leon wipe her out if he finds out she's trash-talking him behind his back?

301
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:58,020
If it were me, I can safely say I'd wipe her out.

302
00:17:58,670 --> 00:18:01,390
Hey! You're thinking something really rude right now, aren't you?!

303
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,840
Nope, not at all!

304
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:06,620
So, are you going to take me to the Dwelling of Spirits?

305
00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:17,500
You know, I'm not just a Demon Lord.

306
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,530
I'm also the Guide of Saints

307
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:23,670
and the Fairy of the Labyrinth, as well as the former Queen of Spirits.

308
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,240
I have the duty of bestowing

309
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:30,050
the spirits' divine protection upon Heroes, as I did with Leon-chan.

310
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,870
So you don't need to to worry.

311
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:36,360
I am impartial.

312
00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:42,950
I am the one who maintains the balance of this world.

313
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:10,470
Very well.

314
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,020
I will aid you in your summoning.

315
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:16,080
I hope you can call forth powerful spirits.

316
00:19:26,810 --> 00:19:28,040
Treyni?

317
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:31,380
Wow, it's good to hear that those girls are well.

318
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:34,610
They were such cute little spirits back in the day.

319
00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:35,710
Huh?

320
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:39,300
But Treyni-san said she had no connection with the current Queen of Spirits.

321
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:40,860
Ah, right...

322
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:43,020
Even after dying and being reborn,

323
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:45,682
I still retain my memories of my previous life.

324
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:49,860
I guess they don't know that.

325
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:52,620
We got split up a long time ago, and I haven't seen them since.

326
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:55,420
Tell them to come pay me a visit sometime.

327
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,010
Will do.

328
00:19:57,010 --> 00:19:59,000
I can't wait!

329
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:09,020
So this is...

330
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:13,020
The deepest part of the Labyrinth, the Dwelling of Spirits.

331
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:19,310
It's a lot like Veldora's cave.

332
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:21,890
It's overflowing with natural energy.

333
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:26,250
And there are superior spirits here?

334
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:29,700
There are, but they have wills of their own.

335
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:32,980
They'll only respond to your summons if they feel like it.

336
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:35,630
What happens if they don't come?

337
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:37,670
You can just separate some of the energy

338
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:40,480
and create a new superior spirit.

339
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,850
Create one?

340
00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:44,370
So if they won't respond to our summons,

341
00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:47,020
we should just make a new one?

342
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:47,740
Right!

343
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,200
This won't be easy.

344
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,190
I'm concerned about their affinities...

345
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:55,550
But I guess there's no other choice.

346
00:20:56,360 --> 00:21:01,120
I have Degenerate, a special skill that specializes in unification and separation.

347
00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:04,280
If Demon Lord Leon could do it, there's no way I can't.

348
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:08,530
Everyone...

349
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:11,170
Y-Yeah.

350
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:12,370
We're ready.

351
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:14,120
Sensei...

352
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,620
O-Of course we're all right!

353
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,140
We'll do our best!

354
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,280
That's the spirit!

355
00:21:21,410 --> 00:21:22,380
Right!

356
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:27,370
Kenya, Ryota, Gale, Alice, Chloe...

357
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:28,730
Let's do this!

358
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:29,700
Yeah!

359
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:45,710
Shizu-san, wherever you are, are you watching?

360
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:54,370
I'll make sure

361
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,430
your wish is realized.

362
00:22:05,513 --> 00:22:12,394
I have to believe in me that you believe in

363
00:22:12,394 --> 00:22:20,858
A story just started, carrying a name

364
00:22:22,326 --> 00:22:29,050
Whether it's a concidence or a fate, who cares?

365
00:22:29,050 --> 00:22:34,787
Just pick one thing in here

366
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:42,242
Just from one chance, the future would change

367
00:22:42,242 --> 00:22:48,737
Along with the sky, the wind, and the land

368
00:22:48,737 --> 00:22:55,762
It's all because you keep believing in that possiblity

369
00:22:55,762 --> 00:23:02,315
That I can also keep believing. With my power...

370
00:23:02,315 --> 00:23:05,643
In the depths of the world that we must protect,

371
00:23:05,643 --> 00:23:08,997
rise up as many times as it take

372
00:23:08,997 --> 00:23:15,064
If I can't hold it with both hands, I'll lend it to you

373
00:23:15,674 --> 00:23:22,368
Even if you got shaken, face foward for the smile you wish to protect

374
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:27,294
There's a scenary I want to show you,

375
00:23:27,294 --> 00:23:29,815
let's go togehter

376
00:23:36,050 --> 00:23:39,010
Next time, "Saved Souls."
