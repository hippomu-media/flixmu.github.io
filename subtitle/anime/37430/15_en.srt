1
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:04,260
The day after the defeat of the Demon Lord Geld,

2
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:06,940
representatives of each race gathered together

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:09,600
to discuss what would happen after the battle.

4
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:14,950
Chairman Rimuru Tempest, please begin the conference.

5
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:16,700
Uh...

6
00:00:32,424 --> 00:00:37,991
In the night you could count stars in the sky

7
00:00:37,991 --> 00:00:43,489
The overflown drop reflects the swaying world

8
00:00:43,489 --> 00:00:49,386
All life are in ambivalence

9
00:00:49,386 --> 00:00:54,182
And it twinkles as the days goes by

10
00:00:54,850 --> 00:01:00,774
Both short-lived flowers and devastating winds

11
00:01:00,774 --> 00:01:05,026
are the sign of the passing present

12
00:01:05,821 --> 00:01:11,812
To those who live in the moment, this song shall reach you

13
00:01:11,812 --> 00:01:19,902
It will push you to the limits of freedom, telling you to survive

14
00:01:19,902 --> 00:01:22,677
We will find the way

15
00:01:22,677 --> 00:01:31,010
We returners all equally carry a seed of hope

16
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:37,513
Under the whim of miracle, Birth and Demise shall join hand

17
00:01:37,513 --> 00:01:41,572
and the time will flow once again

18
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,770
Uh... I've never led a meeting like this before, so it's not my strong suit.

19
00:01:57,770 --> 00:02:00,070
So I'll just say what's on my mind.

20
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:03,380
I'd like you to save your deliberations until after that.

21
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:09,920
I'll start by saying this: I don't intend to charge the Orcs with any crimes.

22
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:15,780
I know this may upset the Lizardmen, who suffered the most casualties,

23
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,130
but hear me out.

24
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:21,900
The cause of all this was starvation due to a famine.

25
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:27,380
Anyone, of any race, might have made the same choices under those conditions.

26
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:31,550
Of course, this is just my public stance on the matter.

27
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:36,300
Then may we hear your personal thoughts on it, as well?

28
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:40,720
I've taken all of the Orcs' sins upon myself.

29
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,460
If anyone has a complaint, bring it to me.

30
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:44,480
P-Please, wait!

31
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,270
Surely there is no logic to—

32
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:49,140
That was my promise with the Demon Lord Geld.

33
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:56,840
I see.

34
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:01,240
However, I feel that answer is somewhat unfair.

35
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:04,840
Yeah, I can see why he wouldn't accept it so easily.

36
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:09,750
There is one immutable rule shared among all monsters:

37
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:12,140
"Survival of the fittest."

38
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:15,373
The moment they faced each other, they were both prepared for that.

39
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:20,490
You guys lost your home, too. Don't you have any complaints?

40
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:22,870
I would be lying if I said we didn't,

41
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:25,720
but if it happens again, we will not disgrace ourselves a second time.

42
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:29,675
Uh-huh...

43
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:32,820
I see... That is a fair point.

44
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:37,480
But there is one thing I must know.

45
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:38,850
What's that?

46
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:41,750
What will be done with the Orcs?

47
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:47,070
You have said you will not charge them with any crimes.

48
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:50,830
Does that mean you intend to accept all of their survivors?

49
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:57,670
Even with their numbers down, there are still 150,000 of them.

50
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,410
That being the case...

51
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:03,181
It may sound like some kind of dream,

52
00:04:03,181 --> 00:04:05,720
but I'm thinking we can all work together.

53
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:07,420
Work together?

54
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:08,600
Meaning what, exactly?

55
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,730
The Lizardmen will share a clean water source and fish,

56
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:16,750
the Goblins will offer places to live,

57
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:19,670
and our town will give them processed goods.

58
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,970
And in return,

59
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:24,550
the Orcs will contribute labor.

60
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,510
All the races of the Great Forest of Jura will form an alliance

61
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:31,820
and build a mutually cooperative relationship.

62
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:35,960
It'd be really cool if we could create a nation where all races could coexist!

63
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:41,760
A-And you're saying we could also take part in this alliance?

64
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,610
Well, you have nowhere else to go, do you?

65
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:47,010
I have a place for you, so do some work.

66
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,430
I won't tolerate slackers.

67
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,730
Yes, sir!

68
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:56,170
Of course! Of course we will!

69
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:58,730
We will devote our lives to our work!

70
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:05,490
We would be honored to join forces with you.

71
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:07,610
Treyni-san, is that okay with you?

72
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:09,700
Certainly.

73
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:14,620
The Treants under my protection will share the bounty of the forest, as well.

74
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:19,130
I believe we can alleviate the Orcs' hunger for some time.

75
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:22,390
Then...

76
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:25,360
As a caretaker of the forest,

77
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,140
I, Treyni, hereby pledge

78
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:32,720
to acknowledge Great Rimuru as the new chancellor of the Great Forest of Jura...

79
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:34,140
Chancellor?!

80
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,660
...and declare the Jura Forest Alliance

81
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:40,370
to be established under Chancellor Rimuru.

82
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:43,400
Uh... Er... Buh...

83
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:49,610
S-Somehow I just ended up the chancellor of the alliance...

84
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:51,740
Not Treyni-san?!

85
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:56,040
And declining really doesn't seem like an option right now...

86
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:59,120
F-Fine, I will! I'll do it!

87
00:06:00,875 --> 00:06:04,110
Okay, um... I guess that's how it's gonna be,

88
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:05,920
so I'm counting on all of you!

89
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,080
Yes, sir!

90
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:11,610
And thus, while I was left in an uncontrollable cold sweat,

91
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:14,630
the Jura Forest Alliance was established.

92
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:18,080
You need something?

93
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:21,950
Even in the name of survival of the fittest,

94
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:25,190
hate is not a thing that can be resolved so easily.

95
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:29,160
For what we did to your village...

96
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,970
I cannot apologize enough.

97
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:39,620
I realize this is a selfish request...

98
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:45,000
but please, take my head as penance and have mercy on the others!

99
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:55,680
After the battle, we told Great Rimuru that we wished to continue serving him,

100
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:58,310
and he gave us official titles.

101
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:03,150
I am a Samurai, bodyguard to Great Rimuru.

102
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:04,570
I'm also his secretary.

103
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:08,820
Hakurou is an Instructor, and Souei is a Spy.

104
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:12,010
Shuna and Kurobe, who remained in the village, have titles, as well.

105
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:16,450
And I received the title of Samurai General.

106
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:20,920
That puts me in charge of military affairs.

107
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:23,770
And now that I'm in this position,

108
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:27,032
I can't very well rob us of a capable fighter, now, can I?

109
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:36,970
I will show no mercy to any who do wrong to Great Rimuru,

110
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:41,050
but if you join the alliance and revere him as your chancellor, we are not enemies.

111
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:43,480
I wouldn't dream of doing him wrong!

112
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:46,880
He saved all of us.

113
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:50,240
I wish only to serve him. I could never bear him ill will!

114
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:54,240
Then we are fellow servants under the same master.

115
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,200
Do your best to be useful to Great Rimuru.

116
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,910
I'll accept that as your apology.

117
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:08,570
I swear on the name of my father King Geld.

118
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:13,760
Benimaru is such a gracious guy.

119
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:16,050
I should learn from him.

120
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:19,010
And I'll have to give that one a name,

121
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:21,750
as the new leader of the Orcs.

122
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:28,122
In hopes that you inherit the wishes of the Orc Disaster, Geld,

123
00:08:28,122 --> 00:08:29,530
I grant you the name "Geld."

124
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:31,250
Yes, sir!

125
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,390
Lead the Orcs well.

126
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:35,210
Yes, sir.

127
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:45,050
The new Orc ruler, Geld, evolved into the Orc King.

128
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:47,850
After that...

129
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:52,970
I spent ten days naming all 150,000 Orcs.

130
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:58,860
It goes without saying that I went into sleep mode after that.

131
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:04,250
I also gave the name "Abiru" to the Lizardmen's chieftain.

132
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,691
His son, Gabiru,

133
00:09:07,691 --> 00:09:10,020
was charged with the crime of treason.

134
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:12,860
I'm sure to receive the death penalty.

135
00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:14,830
That's as it should be.

136
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:17,220
It's the only way to set an example.

137
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:22,040
But... if there's one thing I regret...

138
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:28,720
I wish I had asked him why he saved me.

139
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:32,500
A worthless fool like me...

140
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:34,410
Raise your head.

141
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:39,090
I will now state the verdict.

142
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:43,600
I will, at least, accept the death penalty with grace.

143
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:47,390
Gabiru, you will be excommunicated and exiled.

144
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:50,480
You will never call yourself a Lizardman again.

145
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:53,980
Cast him out at once!

146
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:56,520
What... did he say?!

147
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:03,540
You forgot something.

148
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:05,679
Here.

149
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:27,510
Sir Gabiru!

150
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:30,100
-Hey! -Sir Gabiru!

151
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:32,770
We've been waiting for you, Sir Gabiru!

152
00:10:32,770 --> 00:10:34,670
We were getting sick of waiting!

153
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:36,230
Time is money.

154
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:39,450
Wh-What are you guys doing?!

155
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:41,370
I've been excommunicated!

156
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:44,670
If you're excommunicated, we're all excommunicated!

157
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:45,540
Indeed.

158
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,030
You guys...

159
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,290
You're such fools.

160
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:56,730
Hopeless, every last one of you!

161
00:10:57,810 --> 00:11:01,090
Very well. I'll look after all of you.

162
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:03,990
Just follow me!

163
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:05,690
That's our boy!

164
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:06,760
So cool!

165
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,240
Most definitely!

166
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:13,890
After you went to the trouble of settin' all that up,

167
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:17,940
I bet it's killin' you that a new Demon Lord wasn't born, huh?

168
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:19,720
Yes...

169
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:25,180
But I did get to see an interesting sight.

170
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:28,950
Now, what shall I do about that slime?

171
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:31,400
Well, good luck to ya.

172
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:35,230
If ya ever need a hand, I'll lend ya one for cheap,

173
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:37,220
Demon Lord Clayman.

174
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:45,930
Three months after the defeat of the Orc Lord,

175
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:49,430
the High Orcs that had evolved from the Orcs

176
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:53,260
were learning new skills in no time, under Kaijin's instruction,

177
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:55,280
and had become a dependable work force.

178
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:01,570
It's great that the houses have been built.

179
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:03,600
We've got clothing and tools, too.

180
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,740
And...

181
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,530
We laid an aqueduct, too!

182
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:10,120
We even have flushing toilets, and both water and sewage systems!

183
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:11,920
We're building roads, too.

184
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,950
The stuff I learned as a general contractor came in handy!

185
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:18,170
This'll be great for commerce with the Lizardmen and other regions.

186
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,170
The bath I asked for will be finished soon, too.

187
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,180
I can't wait!

188
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,180
Right, Ranga?

189
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:29,680
We should all work hard together to make this village an even greater place.

190
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:33,270
Yes, master! As you wish!

191
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:37,050
A place to live in peace...

192
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:40,040
At last, our town was complete!

193
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:45,110
But... things just couldn't be that easy.

194
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:49,200
Great Rimuru, we have an emergency.

195
00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:50,643
Huh?

196
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:03,200
Several hundred pegasus-mounted knights are heading this way.

197
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,070
What?

198
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:16,240
Your Majesty, what news?

199
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:21,220
The Orc Lord has been defeated, and the war has ended.

200
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:23,640
What?!

201
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:29,060
Rather than rampaging, the 150,000 surviving Orcs have scattered.

202
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:31,820
On top of that, they've evolved into High Orcs.

203
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:33,330
That can't be...

204
00:13:35,090 --> 00:13:39,460
With the participation of several superior majin, the war came to an end.

205
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:44,090
Is it safe to assume the majin are all serving that slime?

206
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:49,330
One who rules over majin and causes monsters to evolve...

207
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:54,890
If this matter is not handled with care, this nation may fall.

208
00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:04,630
I will see just who this slime is with my own eyes.

209
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:35,090
It can't be...

210
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:37,270
The Hero King of the Dwarves,

211
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:39,450
Gazel Dwargo...

212
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:43,060
Great Rimuru, what shall we do?

213
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:46,080
I'd rather avoid fighting if possible...

214
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:49,150
It's no problem. We can just knock them all away.

215
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:54,570
If it comes down to a fight, evacuate the townsfolk.

216
00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:56,790
We'll buy time until then.

217
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:58,390
Right.

218
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:07,880
It is a pleasure to see you again.

219
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:11,680
It's been a long time, Kaijin.

220
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:12,969
Yes, Majesty!

221
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:17,450
You are the slime?

222
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:20,250
I'll introduce myself first.

223
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:21,910
My name is Rimuru.

224
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:25,070
I'm a slime, but I'd rather you didn't call me that.

225
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:29,570
I am the chancellor of the Jura Forest Alliance, after all.

226
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:33,300
This isn't really my true form,

227
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:35,830
but it's easier to talk to me this way, right?

228
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:38,350
So... why are you here?

229
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:40,210
I'll get right to the point.

230
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:44,210
Rimuru, I've come to see what you truly are.

231
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:45,960
What I truly—

232
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:50,590
I will expose your true nature with my sword!

233
00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:56,260
Since you boasted of being the chancellor of this forest,

234
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:59,600
it seems I must teach you, exactly, where you stand!

235
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:02,610
If that sword is more than mere decoration,

236
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:05,860
you would do well to accept my proposal.

237
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:08,940
Your Majesty, are you...

238
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:13,590
An earnest battle is the quickest way to settle this, is it not?

239
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:16,990
All right, then. I accept.

240
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,830
I'll make you regret accusing me of boasting.

241
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:38,600
If you can defend against my entire chain of attacks, you win.

242
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:41,900
However...

243
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:46,860
I suggest you do not underestimate the sword skill of Master Swordsman Gazel Dwargo.

244
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,230
Fine.

245
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:55,820
Very well. I will serve as witness to this contest.

246
00:16:57,590 --> 00:16:59,830
Is that... a Dryad?

247
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:06,410
I willingly apologize for accusing you of boasting.

248
00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:09,590
I have a vague understanding of the circumstances now.

249
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:11,035
Then...

250
00:17:11,035 --> 00:17:14,760
But that is a separate matter from judging your true nature.

251
00:17:15,070 --> 00:17:15,870
Huh?

252
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:21,770
Now that we have a witness, all that remains is to cross swords!

253
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,310
Yeah, I guess so.

254
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:28,560
I'll win this in no time and make you explain what's going on here.

255
00:17:30,170 --> 00:17:32,820
If you manage to defeat me, you will have your answer.

256
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:35,320
Begin!

257
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,960
Is that all the strength you have, Rimuru?

258
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:53,400
Quiet! I just haven't started taking this seriously yet.

259
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,581
Don't rush me.

260
00:18:02,770 --> 00:18:04,630
He's strong, all right...

261
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:07,600
But I can't just lose this.

262
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:12,770
That stance...

263
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:14,610
Here I come, Rimuru!

264
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:16,950
Haze: Thunder of Heaven and Earth!

265
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,160
The next strike is coming... from above!

266
00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:40,550
You managed to stop my strike!

267
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:43,180
Enough.

268
00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:46,100
The winner is Rimuru Tempest.

269
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:52,400
I understand now after crossing swords with you.

270
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,860
You are not an evil being.

271
00:18:56,090 --> 00:18:57,860
What the hell?

272
00:18:58,230 --> 00:19:03,050
I am impressed that you saw through my Haze: Thunder of Heaven and Earth.

273
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,870
Well done, Rimuru.

274
00:19:06,050 --> 00:19:08,060
Oh, that was just a coincidence.

275
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:12,100
My master used that move, so I dealt with it a lot in training.

276
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:13,935
That's all, really.

277
00:19:13,935 --> 00:19:17,920
What? Could it be your master was...

278
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:23,890
Excellent work, Great Rimuru.

279
00:19:25,210 --> 00:19:26,640
The Savant!

280
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:31,770
You no longer look like the little boy I found lost in the forest.

281
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:34,290
Ah... Forgive me, Dwarf King.

282
00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:38,930
I am overjoyed to see that you have surpassed me with the sword.

283
00:19:38,930 --> 00:19:41,780
What an honor to hear you say that.

284
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:44,490
Hakurou was his master, huh?

285
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:48,660
You really never can tell how things might be connected in this world.

286
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:55,690
-Great Rimuru really is amazing, huh? -Truly the best.

287
00:19:55,690 --> 00:19:57,030
I see.

288
00:19:57,030 --> 00:20:01,170
You were investigating the odd assembly of monsters that defeated the Orc Lord.

289
00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:05,930
Yes, to determine whether they were friend or foe.

290
00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:10,430
Rimuru, there's something I must ask you.

291
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:11,710
Sure.

292
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,690
Have you any interest in entering a treaty with me?

293
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:22,420
If you were to gain control of everything in this vast forest,

294
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:27,200
you could obtain wealth and power surpassing my own nation.

295
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:31,830
It would serve you well to have another nation supporting you at such a time.

296
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,660
That would be fantastic, but...

297
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:38,920
Are you sure?

298
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:44,970
That would be the same as acknowledging our gathering of monsters as its own nation.

299
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,460
Of course.

300
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:50,770
And this deal would benefit us, as well.

301
00:20:50,770 --> 00:20:53,190
Both sides stand to profit.

302
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:57,420
I guess I have no reason to refuse.

303
00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:00,360
I gladly accept.

304
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:01,780
Good.

305
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:05,360
And what is the name of your nation?

306
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:09,330
Our nation's name?

307
00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:10,870
I didn't think of that!

308
00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:17,410
Um... If I take one from "Forest of Jura" and "Rimuru Tempest"...

309
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:20,630
The Jura Tempest Federation!

310
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:23,380
The Jura Tempest Federation?

311
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:26,270
That's our Great Rimuru!

312
00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:29,920
Then our nation shall be called the Jura Tempest Federation,

313
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:32,680
and this town shall be called Rimuru!

314
00:21:32,910 --> 00:21:33,640
Huh?!

315
00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:36,070
Capital City Rimuru!

316
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:37,980
Hang on, that's kinda embarrassi—

317
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:39,590
Capital City Rimuru!

318
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:41,230
No other name would do!

319
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:44,490
I agree. It's a perfect name for our town.

320
00:21:44,490 --> 00:21:46,350
H-Huh?

321
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:48,110
It would seem that this is settled.

322
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:51,070
Yeah.

323
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:57,460
On this day, the names "the Jura Tempest Federation" and "Capital City Rimuru"

324
00:21:57,460 --> 00:22:02,250
were engraved in history for the first time.

325
00:22:05,513 --> 00:22:12,394
I have to believe in me that you believe in

326
00:22:12,394 --> 00:22:20,858
A story just started, carrying a name

327
00:22:22,326 --> 00:22:29,050
Whether it's a concidence or a fate, who cares?

328
00:22:29,050 --> 00:22:34,787
Just pick one thing in here

329
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:42,242
Just from one chance, the future would change

330
00:22:42,242 --> 00:22:48,737
Along with the sky, the wind, and the land

331
00:22:48,737 --> 00:22:55,762
It's all because you keep believing in that possiblity

332
00:22:55,762 --> 00:23:02,315
That I can also keep believing. With my power...

333
00:23:02,315 --> 00:23:05,643
In the depths of the world that we must protect,

334
00:23:05,643 --> 00:23:08,997
rise up as many times as it take

335
00:23:08,997 --> 00:23:15,064
If I can't hold it with both hands, I'll lend it to you

336
00:23:15,674 --> 00:23:22,368
Even if you got shaken, face foward for the smile you wish to protect

337
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:27,294
There's a scenary I want to show you,

338
00:23:27,294 --> 00:23:29,815
let's go togehter

339
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:39,260
Next time, "Demon Lord Milim Attacks."
