1
00:00:01,250 --> 00:00:03,090
The alliance between the Jura Tempest Federation

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:05,810
and the Armed Nation of Dwargon was established,

3
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:10,540
and the nation of monsters gained powerful backing support.

4
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:14,360
I'm here, Rimuru!

5
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:16,470
What brings you here this time?

6
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:18,630
I'm here to give you all a gift.

7
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:19,810
A gift?

8
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:26,927
Huh?!

9
00:00:26,927 --> 00:00:28,620
That's Vesta!

10
00:00:41,424 --> 00:00:46,991
In the night you could count stars in the sky

11
00:00:46,991 --> 00:00:52,489
The overflown drop reflects the swaying world

12
00:00:52,489 --> 00:00:58,386
All life are in ambivalence

13
00:00:58,386 --> 00:01:03,182
And it twinkles as the days goes by

14
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:09,774
Both short-lived flowers and devastating winds

15
00:01:09,774 --> 00:01:14,026
are the sign of the passing present

16
00:01:14,821 --> 00:01:20,812
To those who live in the moment, this song shall reach you

17
00:01:20,812 --> 00:01:28,902
It will push you to the limits of freedom, telling you to survive

18
00:01:28,902 --> 00:01:31,677
We will find the way

19
00:01:31,677 --> 00:01:40,010
We returners all equally carry a seed of hope

20
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:46,513
Under the whim of miracle, Birth and Demise shall join hand

21
00:01:46,513 --> 00:01:50,572
and the time will flow once again

22
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,640
It seemed a waste to leave such a talented man doing nothing,

23
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:12,410
but I cannot allow him to work in my service.

24
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:13,900
Use him as you wish.

25
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:19,820
My King... That would allow Vesta's knowledge to leave the Dwarves!

26
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:23,290
Says the man who left the Dwarves himself?

27
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:26,320
That is what this alliance is for.

28
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:31,710
Make this land you have chosen to inhabit a leader in new and unique skills!

29
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,060
Vesta...

30
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:34,210
Y-Yes?

31
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:37,740
Devote yourself to studying here.

32
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,470
I shall.

33
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:43,290
My King, this time...

34
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:46,220
This time, I will live up to your expectations.

35
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:52,190
Rimuru, Kaijin... I am truly sorry.

36
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:57,230
Would you allow me to work here?

37
00:02:58,270 --> 00:03:02,170
Having one more talented researcher around will be a big help.

38
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:06,130
Rimuru, if anything bad happens, I'll take responsibility.

39
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:10,000
Please have faith in me and show him mercy.

40
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,170
Kaijin...

41
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:16,780
If it's okay with you, Kaijin, I have no objections.

42
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,510
Welcome aboard, Vesta.

43
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:23,890
Thank you! I am unworthy, but I will give my utmost effort for you!

44
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:26,510
Then, farewell!

45
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:34,230
Now, then...

46
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,980
What are you doing here?

47
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:42,560
Well... I, Gabiru, have arrived in hopes that I may be of some help to you!

48
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,240
You're so cool, Sir Gabiru!

49
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,240
Naturally!

50
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:46,480
I'll cut him up.

51
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,490
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

52
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:51,000
We hoped you would permit us to join your ranks!

53
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,370
On my word, we will prove useful to you, so please!

54
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:55,460
Please!

55
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:58,310
It's as Sir Gabiru says.

56
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:00,710
My brother has seen the error of his ways.

57
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:03,340
Please grant him the opportunity to atone.

58
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:05,390
The captain of the guard is here, too?

59
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:08,840
Unlike my brother, I have not been disowned.

60
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:09,400
What?!

61
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:13,020
My father, Abiru, sent me here to gain more experience.

62
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:15,470
You didn't follow me because you missed me?!

63
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:16,150
No.

64
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:17,020
D'oh!

65
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:18,860
I see.

66
00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:25,262
And so Vesta, along with Gabiru and his brethren, joined the nation.

67
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:31,680
Since they were now allies, I gave Gabiru's sister and servants names, too.

68
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:34,040
Okay, in this order, you're...

69
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:38,940
Soka, Toka, Saika, Nanso, and Hokuso.

70
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:41,920
Thank you so much.

71
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:46,721
Gabiru-kun, don't act so jealous.

72
00:04:46,721 --> 00:04:49,810
You already have a perfectly good name, "Gabiru."

73
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:51,730
Wait, did I just—

74
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,310
Gabiru's shining...

75
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:58,810
Wait, can names be overwritten?!

76
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:02,380
Thank you! I will follow you for the rest of my life!

77
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:08,910
So I had no choice but to name all of Gabiru's brethren,

78
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:12,250
and they evolved into Dragonewts.

79
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:15,490
They want to join our ranks?

80
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,050
May I use them as I wish?

81
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:18,830
Sure.

82
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:21,340
Train them up as you see fit.

83
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,630
As you command, Great Rimuru.

84
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:27,010
I'll work my hardest for you!

85
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:30,110
I left Soka and the other servants in Souei's care

86
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:32,260
and gave Gabiru and his boys work to do.

87
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:34,270
That aside...

88
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:39,150
I guess some Lizardmen end up looking almost human when they evolve.

89
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:45,550
Gabiru and his boys were sent to cultivate valuable hipokute herbs in Veldora's cave.

90
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:48,830
It's a damp place, so it's a perfect home for them, too.

91
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:51,220
Gabiru-kun!

92
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:53,660
How's the cultivation coming along?

93
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:56,660
I'm glad you asked!

94
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:58,080
It's coming along nicely!

95
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:01,290
Behold the fruits of my labor!

96
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:02,410
Let's see.

97
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,300
That's just a weed!

98
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:07,120
Wh-What?!

99
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,813
I do apologize! It seems I was a bit too hasty for results!

100
00:06:11,813 --> 00:06:16,400
Weeds should be even harder to grow in a magicule-rich place like this!

101
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:21,690
We also set up a room for Vesta to do his research in the cave.

102
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:26,940
He's working to create healing potions from hipokute herbs.

103
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:32,701
If we can mass-produce potions as effective as the ones I produce within me,

104
00:06:32,701 --> 00:06:34,620
it'll be a big help for us.

105
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,710
A lot has happened,

106
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:42,130
but it looks like we can finally take it easy.

107
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:50,130
Interesting! Very interesting!

108
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:53,260
I'll undertake the investigation of this toy myself!

109
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:57,390
But, Milim, we have a non-aggression pact with the Forest of Jura.

110
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:59,590
A non-aggression pact?

111
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:03,400
Now that Veldora's gone, we can abolish that.

112
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:06,150
I see. That is true.

113
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:09,770
All right, that's that!

114
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:12,570
But no interfering with each other! Got it?

115
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:14,410
Of course.

116
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:17,290
Then, it's settled! We have an agreement!

117
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:20,070
I'm going out to investigate at once!

118
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:23,380
Don't try to interfere, Clayman, Carrion, and Frey!

119
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:27,130
What is this magic I sense?

120
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:31,180
An enormous mass of magic power is heading this way at an incredible speed!

121
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,420
Greetings!

122
00:07:57,420 --> 00:08:02,175
I am the one and only Dragonoid, also known as the Destroyer,

123
00:08:02,175 --> 00:08:04,590
the Demon Lord Milim Nava!

124
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:06,650
She's a Demon Lord?!

125
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:09,900
I heard you were the strongest in this town,

126
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:11,470
so I came to introduce myself.

127
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:16,630
Her ambition is every bit as powerful as Veldora's.

128
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:19,350
She's definitely a real Demon Lord.

129
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,290
N-Nice to meet you.

130
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:25,400
I'm Rimuru, the leader of this town.

131
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:30,900
I-It's impressive that you could tell a slime like me was the strongest here.

132
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:35,160
A simple task for one such as me!

133
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:40,400
My Milim Eye can even ascertain the level of magicules in whoever it sees!

134
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,000
Oh? Milim Eye?

135
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,552
Just assume that it's no use pretending to be a weakling around me.

136
00:08:47,552 --> 00:08:50,780
Is that something like my skill, Appraisal?

137
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:54,450
And I don't need to appraise her to see...

138
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,880
she's flat.

139
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:58,010
I can't beat this one.

140
00:08:58,010 --> 00:09:00,140
I'm pretty sure nothing I do will work.

141
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,230
She's definitely a Catastrophe.

142
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:08,750
By the way, is that your true form?

143
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:14,530
Was that silver-haired humanoid who defeated Gelmud a transformation?

144
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:19,160
Sounds like you know everything.

145
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:23,040
Is this the form you're referring to?

146
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,790
Ooh! So it really was you!

147
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:29,500
So you defeated the Orc Lord?

148
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:32,450
W-Well, yes, I did win...

149
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:35,090
So, what business do you have with me?

150
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:40,270
You're... not here to avenge Gelmud, are you?

151
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:42,307
Hm? My business?

152
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,250
I came to introduce myself.

153
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:49,810
That's it?!

154
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:52,650
Prepare to die!

155
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:54,530
Come, Master!

156
00:09:58,820 --> 00:09:59,850
W-Wait, Ranga!

157
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:01,530
We cannot wait! Forgive me!

158
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:06,580
Oh, you want to play with me?

159
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:08,020
I said wait!

160
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,380
You may be a Demon Lord,

161
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:21,140
but no one can escape the binding of these threads.

162
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,470
Burn to ash!

163
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:30,020
I hope that at least singed her.

164
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:35,190
Wow, this is amazing!

165
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:38,757
Any other Demon Lord might not have escaped

166
00:10:38,757 --> 00:10:41,850
an attack like that in one piece!

167
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:46,410
But it's not gonna work on me!

168
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,670
Master!

169
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,900
You okay, Shion?

170
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:01,530
Here's a healing potion.

171
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:03,510
Great Rimuru...

172
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:07,030
Great Rimuru... Please flee from here.

173
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:09,060
We will... handle this...

174
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:11,190
Here's some for you guys, too.

175
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:12,870
Drink those and rest.

176
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,820
I'll take care of this.

177
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:20,940
What's this? Haven't played enough yet?

178
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,660
Very well.

179
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:25,870
I'll play with you some more.

180
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:27,770
Great Rimuru...

181
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:29,870
Once you give up, it's all over.

182
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:31,990
So you gotta do what you can.

183
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:34,200
Don't get your hopes up.

184
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:38,550
Oh? You're going to face me?

185
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,900
If you're so confident, why not taste one of my attacks?

186
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:48,060
Very well! Sounds interesting!

187
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,330
But if it doesn't work,

188
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:54,690
you must swear to become my subordinate.

189
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,250
Fine.

190
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,805
Answer.

191
00:11:57,805 --> 00:11:59,730
To the nearest measurable degree,

192
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:02,311
her magicules exceed yours by more than ten times.

193
00:12:02,311 --> 00:12:06,610
She hasn't even gotten serious yet, and she's ten times stronger than me?

194
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,179
In that case,

195
00:12:10,179 --> 00:12:12,190
there's just one thing I can do.

196
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,630
Take this!

197
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:39,360
What in the world is this?!

198
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,240
I've never had anything so delicious!

199
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,352
Yes!

200
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:45,950
What's wrong, Demon Lord Milim?

201
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:46,860
Huh?

202
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:49,340
If you'll admit defeat to me now,

203
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:52,790
I'd be willing to give you this, too.

204
00:12:55,930 --> 00:12:58,720
It's honey I found and ate in the forest.

205
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,800
I want it!

206
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:04,880
But to admit defeat...

207
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:08,260
Mm, that's tasty!

208
00:13:08,306 --> 00:13:11,630
Whoops, looks like I'm running low now.

209
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:14,020
W-Wait, wait! I have a proposal!

210
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:16,570
A draw! Why don't we call it a draw this time?!

211
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:19,150
We'll forget all of this happened!

212
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:20,150
Oh-ho?

213
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:22,700
O-Of course, that's not all!

214
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:26,570
I'll swear never to mess with any of you ever again!

215
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:28,490
I win.

216
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:30,420
Her power is overwhelming,

217
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:33,050
but she's as much a child on the inside as she is on the outside.

218
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:36,300
Very well. I'll accept your terms.

219
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:39,670
All right. We'll call it a draw this time.

220
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:48,170
And that's how we overcame this unprecedented Catastrophe.

221
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:57,440
It's so good! This is so good!

222
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,600
Glad to hear it.

223
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:03,700
I wish she'd just leave before this gets any more out of hand...

224
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:05,366
Hey...

225
00:14:05,366 --> 00:14:08,110
Don't you ever think of becoming a Demon Lord?

226
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:11,620
Why should I put myself through that kind of hassle?

227
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:13,620
Huh? But you'd be a Demon Lord!

228
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:17,060
Aren't they awesome? Doesn't everyone want to be one?

229
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:18,120
Hell no.

230
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:18,870
Huh?!

231
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:19,660
Huh?!

232
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:24,000
Does something good happen when you become a Demon Lord?

233
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,990
Strong opponents come from all over to fight you!

234
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:28,051
It's fun!

235
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:30,830
I get plenty of that already. Not interested.

236
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:33,930
What?! Then what do you even enjoy in life?

237
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:35,620
All kinds of things.

238
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:38,260
I've got a lot to do. It's crazy.

239
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:41,190
Is there anything fun about being a Demon Lord besides fighting?

240
00:14:41,650 --> 00:14:43,340
Well, no...

241
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:46,360
But you get to boss Majin and Humans around!

242
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,920
Doesn't that just mean you're bored?

243
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:53,620
Ah. She's definitely bored.

244
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:57,370
Well, I should head back. Take care going home.

245
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:58,320
Wait!

246
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:01,240
You're doing something more fun than being a Demon Lord, aren't you?

247
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:01,880
No—

248
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:03,840
No fair! No fair! No fair!

249
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:05,370
Now I'm mad!

250
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:06,780
I don't know what you want me to—

251
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:10,220
Tell me what it is! And then let me join you!

252
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:11,710
Take me to your village!

253
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:12,760
Temper tantrums now?!

254
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:18,330
Fine, fine. But I have one condition.

255
00:15:18,330 --> 00:15:21,350
From now on, you'll call me "Rimuru-san."

256
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,480
Screw that! You should address me with respect!

257
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:26,180
You will call me "Great Milim"!

258
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:27,360
Okay, let's do this.

259
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:31,660
I'll call you "Milim," and you can call me "Rimuru."

260
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:32,683
How's that?

261
00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:36,660
Fine... But just you and no one else!

262
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:40,870
The only ones I allow to call me "Milim" are my fellow Demon Lords.

263
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:43,070
Right, right. Thanks a lot.

264
00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:46,000
So I guess we're friends from now on.

265
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:47,460
Y-Yeah...

266
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:49,490
I'll show you my village now,

267
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:52,010
but no causing any commotion without my permission.

268
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,070
Promise me, Milim.

269
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:57,260
Of course! I promise, Rimuru!

270
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:02,840
Leave it to Great Rimuru to tame the Demon Lord Milim so easily.

271
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:03,928
Yeah.

272
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,820
That's to be expected of Great Rimuru.

273
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:09,060
I shall go and inform Rigurd at once.

274
00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:12,410
Oh?

275
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:15,780
And who is this little runt?

276
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,800
Who are you calling a runt?

277
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,460
You wanna be murdered?

278
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:28,460
I just told her not to cause any commotion...

279
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:32,000
Listen up! I'm in a very good mood right now!

280
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,970
That's why I'm letting you off the hook!

281
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,470
It won't happen again, so watch your step!

282
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:42,060
I saw my father waving at me from across the river...

283
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:43,980
Your father's alive, dork.

284
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:44,910
Huh?

285
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:47,190
By the way, who's this little—

286
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,230
I mean... this young lady?

287
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:53,740
This is Milim. She's a Demon Lord, apparently.

288
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:55,650
A Demon Lord?!

289
00:16:55,650 --> 00:16:57,490
I know the feeling, man.

290
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:02,620
Listen, Milim, you can't just slug someone right away when you get mad.

291
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:05,760
It's his fault for making me mad.

292
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,380
Besides, that was just my way of saying hello!

293
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:12,130
Slugging people is not saying hello. No more of that.

294
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:17,020
Allow me to introduce our new ally.

295
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:21,260
We'll be treating her as a guest, so be courteous with her.

296
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:23,270
I'm Milim Nava!

297
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:26,300
What?! The Demon Lord Milim?!

298
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:29,480
Wow! This is my first time seeing her!

299
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,730
Way to go, Great Rimuru!

300
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:34,810
He befriended a tyrant like her...

301
00:17:34,810 --> 00:17:38,240
This means Tempest can exist in peace!

302
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,840
So Milim is famous?

303
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:42,990
Everyone's surprisingly okay with this.

304
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:46,140
I've decided to live here from now on! Nice to know you!

305
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:47,000
Huh?!

306
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:51,170
What do you mean, live here?

307
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:53,340
Exactly what I said.

308
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:55,670
I've decided to live here, too!

309
00:17:55,670 --> 00:17:56,640
Uh...

310
00:17:57,290 --> 00:18:01,850
W-Well, you heard her, so treat her as you would any other.

311
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,560
She's pretty popular...

312
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:09,250
If anything happens, you can rely on me!

313
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:14,070
Friends with a Demon Lord, huh?

314
00:18:14,810 --> 00:18:17,650
You're right. Calling us "friends" is a little weird.

315
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,660
Er, you heard me?

316
00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:24,540
Let me think... Rather than friends...

317
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26,710
We're besties!

318
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:28,910
Besties?!

319
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:31,130
Aren't we?

320
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:35,510
We're besties! We're besties!

321
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:38,050
Everyone! We're besties!

322
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:46,822
Besties! Besties! Besties!

323
00:18:46,822 --> 00:18:51,026
There, see? You're so good at surprising people!

324
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:55,190
And thus, the Demon Lord Milim, a being more dangerous than a powder keg,

325
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:58,730
became a part of the Jura Tempest Federation.

326
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:07,620
What is this? It feels fantastic!

327
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:10,610
Myrd of the three Dwarf brothers designed it for me.

328
00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:13,590
It's my beloved hot spring, flowing freely from the source.

329
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:17,040
Amazing! You can swim in here!

330
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:20,650
You shouldn't swim in the bath.

331
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:22,560
Don't do it.

332
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:28,230
Right, well... I just casually joined in, but I think I'm ready...

333
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:31,870
...for some coffee milk.

334
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:35,520
Milk is one thing, but I wonder if we can make coffee...

335
00:19:36,130 --> 00:19:39,120
Come to think of it, we managed to raise dandelions.

336
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,230
Great Rimuru.

337
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:42,460
Oh... What's up?

338
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:44,370
It's about Lady Milim.

339
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:48,530
I never imagined a Demon Lord would take the initiative in coming here.

340
00:19:48,530 --> 00:19:53,110
Yeah, but she did promise not to cause any commotion without my permission.

341
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:58,380
Yes, but... what's more concerning is what the other Demon Lords will do.

342
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:01,630
What do you mean?

343
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:04,540
There are several Demon Lords,

344
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:06,890
and they're always keeping each other in check.

345
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:11,880
Your declaration that Lady Milim is our friend

346
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:15,860
means this village is now under her protection.

347
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:20,870
Under normal circumstances, that might be a good thing, but...

348
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:25,280
Great Rimuru, you hold the position of supreme ruler.

349
00:20:25,570 --> 00:20:30,730
In other words, it will appear to the other Demon Lords that

350
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:35,290
the Great Forest of Jura has forged an alliance with the Demon Lord Milim.

351
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:38,990
The Demon Lord Milim will instantly gain more influence,

352
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:41,460
upsetting the balance among the Demon Lords.

353
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:43,720
I see.

354
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:49,720
But in reality, there is no way we could stop the Demon Lord Milim.

355
00:20:50,010 --> 00:20:52,570
Her strength was on a completely different level.

356
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:56,600
If not for Great Rimuru, we wouldn't be alive right now.

357
00:20:56,830 --> 00:21:01,040
Precisely. If the other Demon Lords become hostile,

358
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:03,530
would we not have a better chance against them?

359
00:21:07,910 --> 00:21:09,160
On that note...

360
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:14,040
We shall entrust everything to Great Rimuru, the one she has deemed her "bestie"!

361
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:15,710
No objections.

362
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:16,830
You dumped it all on me?!

363
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:21,490
Lady Milim is one of the most powerful of all Demon Lords.

364
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:25,970
She is known as a Demon Lord that everyone should avoid making an enemy of.

365
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:30,590
We have no choice but to entrust everything to Great Rimuru.

366
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:36,840
"I guess there's no choice"... or so I thought.

367
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:41,480
But we didn't know that the whirlwind Milim would stir up

368
00:21:41,970 --> 00:21:44,970
had only just begun to blow.

369
00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:48,240
This is fun!

370
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:53,620
I told you, you shouldn't play in the bath!

371
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:57,166
Take that!

372
00:21:59,210 --> 00:22:00,830
Now you've done it! Take that!

373
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:03,040
Enough, you two!

374
00:22:05,513 --> 00:22:12,394
I have to believe in me that you believe in

375
00:22:12,394 --> 00:22:20,858
A story just started, carrying a name

376
00:22:22,326 --> 00:22:29,050
Whether it's a concidence or a fate, who cares?

377
00:22:29,050 --> 00:22:34,787
Just pick one thing in here

378
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:42,242
Just from one chance, the future would change

379
00:22:42,242 --> 00:22:48,737
Along with the sky, the wind, and the land

380
00:22:48,737 --> 00:22:55,762
It's all because you keep believing in that possiblity

381
00:22:55,762 --> 00:23:02,315
That I can also keep believing. With my power...

382
00:23:02,315 --> 00:23:05,643
In the depths of the world that we must protect,

383
00:23:05,643 --> 00:23:08,997
rise up as many times as it take

384
00:23:08,997 --> 00:23:15,064
If I can't hold it with both hands, I'll lend it to you

385
00:23:15,674 --> 00:23:22,368
Even if you got shaken, face foward for the smile you wish to protect

386
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:27,294
There's a scenary I want to show you,

387
00:23:27,294 --> 00:23:29,815
let's go togehter

388
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:38,820
Next time, "The Gathering."
