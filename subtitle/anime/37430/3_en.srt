1
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:04,810
The Storm Dragon Veldora was sealed by Unlimited Imprisonment.

2
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:09,150
To break that seal, Rimuru ate Veldora.

3
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:11,950
They both began the process of analyzing the seal,

4
00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:14,820
Veldora from the inside and Rimuru from the outside,

5
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:17,990
with the goal of setting Veldora free someday.

6
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:22,750
After gaining several new skills and leaving the cave,

7
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:24,250
Rimuru met the Goblins,

8
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:29,110
and he ended up vowing to protect them from an attack by Direwolves.

9
00:00:30,434 --> 00:00:35,155
Beyond a Fiction that nobody knows,

10
00:00:35,155 --> 00:00:40,510
here I open a nameless Story!

11
00:00:53,381 --> 00:00:58,017
The sky above holds a tomorrow brimming with hope

12
00:00:58,017 --> 00:01:03,342
My days were vauge as I'm wondering What's the name?

13
00:01:03,342 --> 00:01:07,906
It took my far-reaching dream that kept me standing in awe

14
00:01:07,906 --> 00:01:13,066
along with my despair and consume them all away

15
00:01:13,066 --> 00:01:17,521
My voice has been engraved by the shape of my wish

16
00:01:17,521 --> 00:01:22,038
Make it stronger, stronger, even stronger!

17
00:01:22,038 --> 00:01:25,192
Fly high!

18
00:01:26,893 --> 00:01:31,915
Beyond a Fiction that nobody knows,

19
00:01:31,915 --> 00:01:36,947
There's a slowly sprouting impulse of Skill to stay alive

20
00:01:36,947 --> 00:01:41,810
If what I feel right now is Reality, then it will surely be a proof someday

21
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:46,729
Each one of your story, I shall give a name to it

22
00:01:46,729 --> 00:01:52,040
to the east, to the west, to the high stand up to the period!

23
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:54,632
Let's go!

24
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:13,270
Looks like I shouldn't expect to find many who can fight Direwolves.

25
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:16,950
They all look too scrawny and beat-up.

26
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,250
Talk about pressure...

27
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:26,790
Everyone, do you understand our situation?

28
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:27,590
Yes!

29
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:31,500
We are prepared for a life-or-death battle!

30
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:35,160
No need to get all worked up. Just relax.

31
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:38,300
Think only about doing the best you can.

32
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,630
I didn't mean to sound that cool...

33
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:47,060
But first, take me to where the wounded are.

34
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:55,320
We did all we could for them, but...

35
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:58,300
That's deeper than I'd imagined.

36
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:01,060
Did their claws and fangs do that much damage?

37
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:03,070
Well, might as well try it...

38
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,100
Wh-What are you doing?!

39
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:12,120
Huh? I'm...

40
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,790
Y-Your wounds...

41
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,500
They're healed!

42
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:20,170
I guess it never hurts to try!

43
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:24,300
I never thought eating him and throwing all those potions in my body at him

44
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:26,290
would be so effective!

45
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:30,310
These healing potions really work!

46
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,560
Next! And next!

47
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:38,170
Since I ate all those hipokute herbs, I've got plenty to spare!

48
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:39,440
I'll heal 'em all!

49
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:45,520
Y-You are magnificent, Great Rimuru!

50
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:51,170
That's the last of the wounded.

51
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:52,750
Now, then...

52
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,100
We'll build a fence.

53
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:56,760
Fortify the village's defenses!

54
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,130
Right.

55
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,000
It's a fine night.

56
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:14,160
Veldora's protection has vanished from this forest.

57
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,270
We have nothing to fear any longer.

58
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:20,040
Tonight, we will destroy the Goblin Village

59
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:23,180
and create a foothold here in the Great Forest of Jura!

60
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:28,320
We will rule this forest!

61
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:34,440
Our claws can tear apart any monster,

62
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,730
and our fangs can chew any monster to pieces!

63
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:56,960
Hah!

64
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,270
What good will such a flimsy fence do?

65
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:02,950
Father...

66
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,790
A slime?

67
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:12,160
Turn back now, and we won't take any action.

68
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,040
Leave this place at once!

69
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:19,030
Insolence! No mere slime can order around us Direwolves!

70
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:20,890
Trample down that fence!

71
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:23,630
Spill the blood of those lowly Goblins!

72
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:40,150
Threads?

73
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,580
That's my skill, Steel Thread.

74
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:45,190
This is your doing?

75
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:46,200
That's right!

76
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,720
A puny monster like you dares do this?!

77
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,370
I will squash you!

78
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:51,530
Father!

79
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,340
Great Rimuru!

80
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:07,680
That's Sticky Thread.

81
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:10,660
This won't hold me!

82
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:15,750
Skill: Water Blade!

83
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:42,350
Hear me, Direwolves!

84
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:45,240
Your boss is dead!

85
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:49,090
I'll give you the choice: submit or die!

86
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,750
Yikes...

87
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:59,400
What if they go the "We'd rather die than submit" route and attack all at once?

88
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:02,320
I wish they'd just turn tail and run...

89
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:05,860
Oh! Predator!

90
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,450
Analysis complete.

91
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:20,290
Acquired ability to mimic Direwolf.

92
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:25,630
Direwolf species skills Supreme Sense of Smell, Thought Communication, and Menace acquired.

93
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:27,450
Right!

94
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:39,460
Hear me! I will let you go just this once.

95
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:44,400
If you refuse to yield to me, I will allow you to leave this place!

96
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,390
Come on, run away already!

97
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:01,540
It's not working? They still want to fight?

98
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,970
Our pack yields to you.

99
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:13,140
Huh?

100
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,740
They could have just run away...

101
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:17,740
U-Um...

102
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:20,020
D-Did we win?

103
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:23,230
Yeah, looks that way.

104
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,070
It's good that there's no need for fighting anymore.

105
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:29,540
Yep, yep. Nothing beats peace.

106
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:37,350
And so the battle at the Goblin Village ended remarkably easily.

107
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:39,880
But...

108
00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:47,870
What now?

109
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:52,630
Who's gonna look after not only the Goblins, but all these pups, too?

110
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:57,480
I guess their numbers are about the same. Then...

111
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,550
Okay, listen up!

112
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:07,650
So, I'm going to have you all pair up and live together!

113
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:09,900
Pair... up?

114
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:11,580
Do you understand?

115
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:16,180
Great Rimuru, what does "pair" mean, exactly?

116
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:17,910
It means to form groups of two.

117
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:19,500
Groups...

118
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:20,740
...of two?

119
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:24,760
Good!

120
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,880
Yesterday's enemy is today's friend!

121
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:31,080
You're all to work together and get along as friends from now on! Got it?

122
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,210
Yes, sir!

123
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:35,170
Help each other out, and make it work.

124
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:39,090
That settles things for now...

125
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:42,520
So, um...

126
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:46,420
What's going to be important now is food, shelter, and clothing.

127
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:49,600
We should form teams to hunt for food, build houses,

128
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:53,570
and strengthen the village defenses.

129
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:55,350
We'll start with...

130
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:58,800
What was his name again?

131
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,950
Wait, do they even have names?

132
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,840
Hey, what are all of your names, anyway?

133
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:07,080
We monsters do not normally have names.

134
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:10,960
Even without names, we can still communicate our thoughts to one another.

135
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,450
Oh, really?

136
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:16,090
But it's more convenient to have names,

137
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:18,870
so I'd like to name you all. Is that okay?

138
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,060
N-Name us?

139
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:24,280
A-Are you certain?

140
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,660
S-Sure.

141
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:33,940
Why are they so excited over something as simple as getting a name?

142
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:39,930
Okay, we'll start with you.

143
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:42,470
Hmm, let's see...

144
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:45,990
What did you call the son you had who died in battle?

145
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:48,170
Rigur.

146
00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:49,650
Rigur, huh?

147
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:52,010
Then you'll be Rigurd.

148
00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:53,110
Rigurd!

149
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,380
Thank you so much! Rigurd! I am so moved!

150
00:10:57,620 --> 00:10:59,230
R-Really?

151
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:02,090
I just picked it because it had the same sound...

152
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:05,170
You'll inherit your brother's name: Rigur.

153
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:06,530
Yes, sir!

154
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:11,100
I'm so grateful that my son has been allowed to inherit Rigur's name!

155
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:14,020
Thank you so much!

156
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:17,560
Where the heck are these reactions coming from?

157
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:22,720
You're Gobta.

158
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,190
Y-Yes, sir! Thank you, sir!

159
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:27,160
You're Gobchi.

160
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:28,990
Gobtsu.

161
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:30,500
Gobte.

162
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:32,770
And you're Gobzo.

163
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:35,810
These names are getting more and more careless...

164
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:38,370
I feel bad seeing them so happy.

165
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:43,430
Um... We truly do appreciate you giving us all names, but...

166
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:47,880
We are aware that your magical power is immense,

167
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:52,460
but are you sure it's all right to give all of us names at once?

168
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,710
Well, I don't see any problem.

169
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:57,020
Well, if you are certain...

170
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:58,110
Who's next?

171
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:01,920
You'll be... Haruna!

172
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:02,780
Okay!

173
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,340
That takes care of all the Goblins.

174
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:10,750
Next is...

175
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:15,550
He's the son of the Direwolf boss, isn't he?

176
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:18,210
I wonder if he holds a grudge against me...

177
00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:19,300
Actually...

178
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:23,300
They don't seem to be holding any grudges at all.

179
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:25,600
Hmm...

180
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,800
Wolf, fangs...

181
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:32,850
Wind... Storm...

182
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:36,120
I know. I'll give him my family name.

183
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:37,880
Tempest...

184
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,570
Tempest Fang...

185
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:41,320
Storm Fang...

186
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,860
Ranga...

187
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:45,320
Oh! Ranga! I like that!

188
00:12:46,210 --> 00:12:48,440
All right! Your name is Ranga!

189
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:50,310
Ranga...

190
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:53,560
I think he likes it.

191
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:57,080
Wh-What's going on? My body...

192
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:57,980
Great Rimuru?!

193
00:12:57,980 --> 00:12:59,800
Everything... is getting... dark...

194
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:00,870
Great Rimuru!

195
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:02,570
Please stay strong!

196
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:03,640
Warning.

197
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:06,590
Internal magicule reserves have fallen below the minimum limit.

198
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:09,090
Entering sleep mode.

199
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:12,180
Estimated time to full recovery: three days.

200
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:14,800
I used up too many magicules?

201
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,310
How...?

202
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:25,080
I couldn't move, speak, or sense my surroundings,

203
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,570
but I was conscious.

204
00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:37,080
It must have been because he named so many of us at once...

205
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:42,840
Apparently, giving names to monsters uses up magicules.

206
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:45,760
I guess that's why Rigurd was so worried.

207
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,590
Is that common knowledge among monsters?

208
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:50,310
You should've said so!

209
00:13:58,260 --> 00:13:59,810
Then, three days later...

210
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:09,030
Full recovery!

211
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:11,130
Oh, Great Rimuru!

212
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:12,700
Good morning!

213
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:14,510
Y-Yeah...

214
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:16,820
You seem to be all better.

215
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:18,620
Who's this?

216
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:21,460
I'll go get Elder Rigurd.

217
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:22,710
Uh, okay.

218
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:27,090
Did this village have a girl that cute in it?

219
00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:30,080
Great Rimuru! Have you awakened?!

220
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,390
Oh, Rigurd!

221
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:35,320
That woman who... was... just...

222
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:36,640
Who are you?!

223
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:39,100
I am Rigurd.

224
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:41,920
What happened in the last three days?!

225
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,160
It's because you gave us names!

226
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,530
Just from that?!

227
00:14:45,530 --> 00:14:48,000
Becoming a monster with a name

228
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,820
raises one's rank as a monster and causes one to evolve!

229
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,530
I-I see...

230
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:58,860
So that's why you were all so happy just to be getting names.

231
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:02,120
No wonder that sucked my magicules dry...

232
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:10,130
Master, allow me to express my utmost joy at your recovery!

233
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:13,100
That horn... The star on your forehead...

234
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:14,580
You're Ranga, right?

235
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:15,370
Yes!

236
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:23,650
Great Rimuru!

237
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:34,520
There's Rigurd...

238
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:36,940
And Rigur...

239
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,590
And Gobta...

240
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:42,620
Well, you didn't change much.

241
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,770
Great Rimuru! Great Rimuru!

242
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:48,510
It's not so much like they evolved.

243
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:51,090
They're like totally different monsters.

244
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:53,390
The male Goblins have evolved to Hobgoblins,

245
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:56,140
and the females to Goblinas.

246
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:11,030
Ranga, if I recall, you were the only Direwolf I named...

247
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:14,530
so why did all of the Direwolves evolve?

248
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:20,630
Master, all of us Direwolves are as one.

249
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:23,580
Our brethren are all connected.

250
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:26,790
Therefore, my name has become our clan's name.

251
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:32,300
Huh... So your entire clan evolved through a shared name?

252
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:35,770
We are no longer the Direwolves.

253
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:38,040
We are the Tempest Wolves!

254
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:41,240
Tempest Wolves...

255
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,890
Well, good for you!

256
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:50,190
Master!

257
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:53,270
Can't you show a little consideration?!

258
00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:54,940
I-I'm so sorry!

259
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:59,280
You can change your own size?! That's handy!

260
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:02,710
Well, the evolving isn't so bad.

261
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:05,650
The problem is what to do about food, shelter,

262
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:08,290
and clothing to sustain both the Goblins and the Wolves...

263
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,800
Master!

264
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:33,490
Right, it took five minutes for all of you to quiet down.

265
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:38,070
They didn't get my best joke?!

266
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:41,260
Great Rimuru, what did you mean by that?

267
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,820
F-Forget about it.

268
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:48,070
As you can see, we're a huge family now.

269
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:52,010
So to avoid problems, I think we should set some rules.

270
00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:53,710
Rules?

271
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,550
There are three rules.

272
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:58,090
I'd like you to uphold them, at the very least.

273
00:17:58,090 --> 00:18:00,470
First, no attacking humans.

274
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:03,470
Second, no fighting amongst yourselves.

275
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,480
Third, no belittling other races.

276
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:07,900
That's it.

277
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:11,210
Sir!

278
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:12,230
Yes, Rigur-kun!

279
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,740
Why aren't we allowed to attack humans?

280
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:17,330
H-Hey! Rigur!

281
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:19,240
It's all right.

282
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:21,460
The reason is simple.

283
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:24,490
It's because I like humans. That's it!

284
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:27,250
I see! Now I understand!

285
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,840
Huh? You... understand?

286
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:30,810
Really?

287
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:36,700
Um, so, listen... Humans live in groups.

288
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:39,380
If you mess with them, they could retaliate in a big way.

289
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,400
And if they came after us in earnest, I doubt we could handle them.

290
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:46,970
Besides, getting along benefits us in lots of ways, anyway.

291
00:18:49,050 --> 00:18:50,900
Any other questions?

292
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:51,710
Me!

293
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:52,710
Gobta-kun!

294
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,280
What did you mean by "no belittling other races"?

295
00:18:56,990 --> 00:18:59,870
Well, you've all gotten stronger by evolving, right?

296
00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:03,530
It means you shouldn't let that get to your head and push weaker races around.

297
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,250
Don't make the mistake of thinking you're better than them.

298
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:10,180
You don't want them getting stronger themselves and retaliating someday, do you?

299
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:11,760
Got it, sir!

300
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:16,090
That's about it. Do your best to follow those rules.

301
00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:17,080
Yes, sir!

302
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:19,300
Also...

303
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:23,920
Elder Rigurd, I declare you the Goblin Lord.

304
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,600
The lord of the Goblins!

305
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:27,530
Lord?!

306
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:30,560
Lead your village well.

307
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:34,600
Yes, sir!

308
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:39,800
I, Rigurd, accept this responsibility on pain of death!

309
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,320
Good. I'm counting on you.

310
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:46,700
Frankly, I was just dumping the job on him. I didn't expect him to be so moved.

311
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:53,680
I then gave jobs to all the Goblins.

312
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:56,210
I assigned a team to keep watch on the surrounding area...

313
00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:00,440
and a team to gather food.

314
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:03,710
It doesn't look like there'll be any problems with these two.

315
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,890
The problem is...

316
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:10,380
The team that builds houses, and the team that makes clothes.

317
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:13,170
The "shelter and clothing" part of "food, shelter, and clothing."

318
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,340
I wouldn't call that a house.

319
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:19,530
I can't do any more than basic handyman stuff,

320
00:20:19,530 --> 00:20:22,650
but I worked in general contracting, so I know good from bad.

321
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:24,250
And this...

322
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,410
You don't need to be a general contractor to figure it out.

323
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:32,020
This is most embarrassing.

324
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:33,480
Forgive us.

325
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,920
And as for your clothes...

326
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:43,210
I-I think they're a little too revealing!

327
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:47,140
That's not necessarily a bad thing, but...

328
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:50,120
There is no one here with the skill to make them.

329
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:50,930
Huh?

330
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:54,110
I-If you can't make them, couldn't you get some from somewhere?

331
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:58,600
There are some with whom we have attempted to trade a few times.

332
00:20:59,010 --> 00:21:02,200
Aside from clothing, they are also quite skilled,

333
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,550
so they may know how to build houses, too.

334
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:05,440
Hmm...

335
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,330
Well, we're getting nowhere this way,

336
00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:09,230
so maybe we should go see them.

337
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:10,570
Who, and where, are they?

338
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:13,830
They are the Dwarves, and they live in Dwargon.

339
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:15,360
Dwarves!

340
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,830
You mean the famous masters of metalworking?!

341
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,590
Now I have no choice but to go!

342
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:23,950
I'll try going to Dwargon.

343
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:26,590
Rigurd, can you look after the village while I'm away?

344
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:27,510
Yes, sir!

345
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:31,080
Leave everything to me!

346
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:40,480
All right, I'll see you later!

347
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,950
Goodbye!

348
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:43,570
Safe travels!

349
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:45,490
Come back soon!

350
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:53,160
And so I left the village to go and meet the Dwarves.

351
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:57,570
I'm told this Dwargon place is a pretty big city,

352
00:21:57,570 --> 00:21:59,310
and it even has a king.

353
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:04,180
I'm a little... no, I'm really excited!

354
00:22:17,204 --> 00:22:22,984
Why is it only those who have hope

355
00:22:22,984 --> 00:22:28,481
To fall into despair from the bottom of their heart?

356
00:22:28,481 --> 00:22:33,405
Why is it only those who have courage

357
00:22:33,405 --> 00:22:39,347
To be wounded at the end of their honor?

358
00:22:39,347 --> 00:22:45,064
I don't want to close my eyes in face of sadness

359
00:22:45,064 --> 00:22:50,693
The dawn for new tomorrow was a mere dream to me

360
00:22:50,693 --> 00:22:56,465
Then I see a light falling through the crack of the night

361
00:22:56,465 --> 00:23:02,916
The sky is crying

362
00:23:03,421 --> 00:23:08,985
I don't know what is there at the corner of the world

363
00:23:08,985 --> 00:23:14,601
All I want is to protect those within my reach

364
00:23:14,601 --> 00:23:20,820
Staring at the only reason to fight

365
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:28,006
We who believe the answer to be forgiveness...

366
00:23:28,006 --> 00:23:32,760
Must not lose!

367
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:38,890
Next time, "In the Kingdom of the Dwarves."
