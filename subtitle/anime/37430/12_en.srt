1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:05,940
Ruler of monsters, and all those who are loyal to him,

2
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:08,480
forgive me for this unannounced visit.

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,340
I am Treyni, a Dryad.

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,670
It is a pleasure to meet you.

5
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:19,420
Rimuru Tempest, ruler of monsters, I would like you

6
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:23,420
to defeat the Orc Lord.

7
00:00:24,444 --> 00:00:29,165
Beyond a Fiction that nobody knows,

8
00:00:29,165 --> 00:00:34,520
here I open a nameless Story!

9
00:00:47,391 --> 00:00:52,027
The sky above holds a tomorrow brimming with hope

10
00:00:52,027 --> 00:00:57,352
My days were vauge as I'm wondering What's the name?

11
00:00:57,352 --> 00:01:01,916
It took my far-reaching dream that kept me standing in awe

12
00:01:01,916 --> 00:01:07,076
along with my despair and consume them all away

13
00:01:07,076 --> 00:01:11,531
My voice has been engraved by the shape of my wish

14
00:01:11,531 --> 00:01:16,048
Make it stronger, stronger, even stronger!

15
00:01:16,048 --> 00:01:19,202
Fly high!

16
00:01:20,903 --> 00:01:25,925
Beyond a Fiction that nobody knows,

17
00:01:25,925 --> 00:01:30,957
There's a slowly sprouting impulse of Skill to stay alive

18
00:01:30,957 --> 00:01:35,820
If what I feel right now is Reality, then it will surely be a proof someday

19
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:40,739
Each one of your story, I shall give a name to it

20
00:01:40,739 --> 00:01:46,050
to the east, to the west, to the high stand up to the period!

21
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:48,642
Let's go!

22
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,720
Defeat the Orc Lord?

23
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,980
Um... You're asking me?

24
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:11,480
Yes, that's right.

25
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:16,050
That's quite a selfish request from someone who just appeared out of nowhere,

26
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,650
Treyni the Dryad.

27
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:21,280
Why have you come here?

28
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:24,160
There are races far stronger than Goblins.

29
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:27,290
Yes, that is true.

30
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,060
If the Ogres' homeland had been at full strength,

31
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:31,980
perhaps I would have gone there.

32
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:35,880
Though, even if I had done that,

33
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:39,600
I still could not have ignored this individual's existence.

34
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:44,480
Were our settlement to be attacked by the Orc Lord,

35
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:47,320
the Dryads could not hope to fight them alone.

36
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:52,240
This is why I have come to request assistance from someone strong.

37
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:57,730
The idea that the Orc Lord even existed was still just a theory to us...

38
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:02,990
The Dryads have knowledge of essentially everything that happens in this forest.

39
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:05,870
The Orc Lord does exist.

40
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,460
If a Dryad acknowledges it...

41
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:14,790
Then it must be true.

42
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:23,090
Give me some time to answer.

43
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,290
I will back up the Kijin,

44
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:28,050
but I don't want to go poking at a hornet's nest for no reason.

45
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:30,770
Let me take stock of the information we have before I answer.

46
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:33,650
Despite how I look, I'm the leader here, after all.

47
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:47,330
Let's continue the conference.

48
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:52,060
Anyone have any ideas what the Orcs might be after?

49
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:57,310
One thing does come to mind...

50
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:58,355
Okay.

51
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:03,610
Souei, did you investigate our village?

52
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:05,159
Yes.

53
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:10,300
Judging by your reaction, I assume you found none?

54
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,549
Correct.

55
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:16,410
Not a single one belonging to either our brethren or the Orcs.

56
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:19,150
Not one what?

57
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:20,791
Corpse.

58
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:25,740
We didn't understand how they were getting the supplies

59
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,770
to keep an army of 200,000 fed.

60
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:31,610
Are you saying...

61
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,750
The unique skill...

62
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:35,600
Starved.

63
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:38,200
Starved?

64
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:43,500
It's a skill that the Orc Lord,

65
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:47,220
a calamity that brings chaos to the world, is born with.

66
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:51,310
Its influence reaches all those who serve under him,

67
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:54,380
making them devour everything in sight, like locusts.

68
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:58,440
At the same time, they consume the victim's strength and abilities,

69
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:01,070
making them their own sustenance.

70
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:04,320
The strength of this comrade we eat is now ours!

71
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:08,070
The strength of this prey we eat is now ours!

72
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:13,330
It's quite similar to your Predator skill.

73
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:18,090
In return for obtaining Starved,

74
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:20,210
they feel constant, insatiable hunger.

75
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:23,300
The Orcs move forward for no other purpose

76
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:26,250
than to sate their endless hunger and gain more power.

77
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:30,390
That is their king's only wish.

78
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:38,260
So the Orcs' goal isn't to wipe out

79
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:41,330
the superior forest races, the Ogres and Lizardmen,

80
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:44,570
but to steal their powers?

81
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:52,140
Well, if that's the case,

82
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:54,580
I can't say we're in the clear.

83
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:57,970
We have Tempest Wolves, Kijin, and Hobgoblins.

84
00:05:57,970 --> 00:06:02,500
Flavors aside, they're all meals with powers that the Orcs would kill for.

85
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:06,760
Aren't you forgetting the one meal that would attract them the most?

86
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:07,880
Huh?

87
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:10,440
We have the strongest slime here, remember?

88
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,600
Where?

89
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:16,590
Huh?

90
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:22,280
In addition, we have confirmed that a certain majin

91
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:24,820
is behind the Orc Lord's appearance.

92
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:28,600
I believe it is someone you won't want to overlook.

93
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:31,440
A majin?

94
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:35,060
It is a subordinate of a Demon Lord, after all.

95
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:43,020
They have knowledge of everything that happens in the forest, huh?

96
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:45,050
This lady's shrewd.

97
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:53,550
Honored Rimuru Tempest.

98
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:59,440
I once again request that you defeat the Orc Lord.

99
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:02,490
As the one who received the Storm Dragon Veldora's protection,

100
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:06,570
subjugated the Direwolves, and became the patron of the Kijin,

101
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:09,500
you are surely more than a match for the Orc Lord.

102
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:15,580
What do you think, Great Sage? Can I trust her?

103
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:19,050
The Dryads are the caretakers of the Great Forest of Jura.

104
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:22,490
They are said to be the ones who pass divine justice on villains

105
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:24,920
and any who would harm the forest.

106
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:28,100
Divine justice, huh?

107
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,840
But there are 200,000 of them.

108
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,940
Of course he will!

109
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:36,140
That Orc Lord is no match for Great Rimuru!

110
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,890
Oh, you agree with me, then?

111
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:39,770
Yes!

112
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:42,310
Are you kidding me?! Did she really just...

113
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:51,640
Fine. I'll accept this request to beat the Demon Lord.

114
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,240
You're all in this with me.

115
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:56,530
Of course, Great Rimuru!

116
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:58,910
That was our plan all along.

117
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:02,960
We believe in you, and we're with you. That's all we need.

118
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,670
Exactly!

119
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:07,210
Let's show them how strong we are!

120
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,800
Yeah!

121
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:17,100
I acted all cool about it, but what if we lose?

122
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:27,360
If we're taking on an army of 200,000 Orcs,

123
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:31,490
I feel like we should consider an alliance with the Lizardmen,

124
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:33,990
but given the guy they had representing them...

125
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,780
I am Gabiru!

126
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:41,980
I'd really like to talk to someone who'll actually listen...

127
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:43,440
Great Rimuru.

128
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:48,100
Would you mind if I spoke personally with the chieftain of the Lizardmen?

129
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:50,380
Souei? You can do that?

130
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:51,279
Yes.

131
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:55,130
Oh, my God, he's so confident! What a dreamboat!

132
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:57,560
O-Okay, then.

133
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:00,640
We'll join forces with the Lizardmen and attack the Orcs.

134
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:01,901
Yes, sir!

135
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:06,620
The battle will probably take place in the marshlands inhabited by the Lizardmen.

136
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:10,960
The Lizardmen's cooperation will be essential for this to work.

137
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,610
I'm counting on you, Souei.

138
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:14,000
It shall be done.

139
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:20,920
I hope their chieftain isn't an idiot like Gabiru...

140
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:31,300
Sir Gabiru!

141
00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:35,010
-You're awake now? -Sir Gabiru...

142
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:38,180
-Wh-Where are we? -Thank goodness...

143
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:43,100
Th-That's right! I was...

144
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,660
defeated by that boy with the dopey face!

145
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:48,780
They clearly tricked us.

146
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:50,360
What do you mean?

147
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,780
It's simple.

148
00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:55,610
That boy who beat me

149
00:09:55,770 --> 00:09:58,740
is obviously the real master of that village!

150
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,170
Really?!

151
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,340
That kid?

152
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:05,030
He must be, or Sir Gabiru wouldn't have lost!

153
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:05,760
Indeed.

154
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:09,220
What a dirty trick, lowering Sir Gabiru's guard with such lies!

155
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:10,740
-Cowards! -How dare they?!

156
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:12,560
Now, calm down.

157
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,880
Such is the wisdom of the weak.

158
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,580
What a great man you are! Great as a mountain!

159
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:21,160
That's our Sir Gabiru!

160
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,910
Yeah! Our next chieftain!

161
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:25,850
You're the best, Gabiru!

162
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:29,230
Oh, no, I'm really not so—

163
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:30,270
Wait, who?! Wha?!

164
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:32,320
He's been here this whole time.

165
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,400
You're just as great as I've heard!

166
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:38,800
My name is Laplace.

167
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,140
Laplace?

168
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:45,160
I've come as a servant of Lord Gelmud to give you a warning.

169
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:47,290
Oh! Lord Gelmud!

170
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,160
Who's Lord Gelmud?

171
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:52,710
He's the man who gave Sir Gabiru his name.

172
00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:54,840
Thank you for taking the trouble to come!

173
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:58,030
So, what is Lord Gelmud's warning?

174
00:10:58,030 --> 00:11:01,720
Well, we have quite the situation on our hands!

175
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:06,400
It seems that army of Orcs

176
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:10,350
really is being led by an Orc Lord.

177
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:12,350
An Orc Lord?!

178
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:18,260
The Lizardman chieftain is a capable man,

179
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:20,860
but he's getting up there in years, you know!

180
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,080
Frankly speaking...

181
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:25,800
Don't you think this is a bit much for Daddy to handle?

182
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:35,180
I had planned to take over as chieftain after we had fought off the Orcs,

183
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:37,500
but it seems that would be too late!

184
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,130
Yep, exactly!

185
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:47,140
Laplace, forgive my leaving so abruptly, but we—

186
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:48,650
Oh, it's fine, it's fine!

187
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:50,980
You're going back to the marshlands, right?

188
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:52,840
You should hurry!

189
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,180
Thank you.

190
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:56,630
Let us go!

191
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:57,770
Yeah!

192
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:09,640
Do the best you can, Gabiru.

193
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:29,810
Trample all! Trample all! Trample all!

194
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:37,830
Chieftain, what shall we do?

195
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:40,410
The Orc army is approaching.

196
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:43,950
What can we do but remain here?

197
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,970
We have no means to fight an army of 200,000 Orcs.

198
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:48,729
Yes, sir.

199
00:12:48,729 --> 00:12:50,420
Chieftain!

200
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:52,580
Chieftain! We have an intruder!

201
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:55,580
He demands an audience with you!

202
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:00,900
Very well. Bring him to me.

203
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,590
Chieftain, is this not dangerous?

204
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:07,480
You can feel this aura, as well?

205
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:10,470
Yes. This is no simple intruder.

206
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:11,350
With this one...

207
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:15,350
even a hundred of the strongest Lizardmen would stand no chance.

208
00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:30,210
Forgive me, but my hands are rather tied at the moment.

209
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:32,160
I cannot spare any hospitality.

210
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:34,320
No need to trouble yourself.

211
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:41,180
I am only a messenger, here to convey to you the words of my master.

212
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:48,050
And what is your message?

213
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:52,150
My master desires an alliance with the Lizardmen.

214
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:53,800
An alliance?

215
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:59,050
But I have no knowledge of your master.

216
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,730
My master is the great Rimuru Tempest.

217
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:05,820
Upon receiving a personal request from the Dryads,

218
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:08,320
he has sworn to defeat the approaching Orc army.

219
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:13,080
A personal request from the caretakers of the forest?

220
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:17,000
She informed us that the Orc army is led by an Orc Lord.

221
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,460
An Orc Lord?!

222
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:22,280
Keep in mind what that means as you consider our proposal.

223
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:29,150
Rimuru, you say? Never heard of him!

224
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:34,160
He probably just came crying to us because he fears the Orc Lord!

225
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,510
If he would just ask for our help...

226
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:37,520
Enough.

227
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:40,020
Hold your tongue.

228
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:43,510
Ch-Chieftain! Such complacency will lead others to belittle—

229
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:46,365
Wh-What is this?

230
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:50,100
Hold.

231
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:53,030
I apologize for my comrade's rudeness.

232
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:57,030
Would you please forgive him?

233
00:14:57,540 --> 00:15:00,250
This offer does benefit both of us equally, does it not?

234
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,610
Forgive me.

235
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:07,630
It was not my intent to threaten him,

236
00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:10,370
but I will not stand for such mockery of my master.

237
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:12,490
Strong words...

238
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:15,690
Had I not stopped him, he would have taken his head in a heartbeat.

239
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:21,900
Judging by your aura, you appear to be an Ogre from the southwest.

240
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:23,530
Not anymore.

241
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:27,400
My master granted me the name "Souei," and I became a Kijin.

242
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:28,650
Kijin?

243
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:32,410
The superior race born only rarely from among the Ogres?

244
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:37,030
If that is true, it would mean that your master

245
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:40,520
is of an even more superior race than the Kijin...

246
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:44,363
An offer to enter an alliance

247
00:15:44,363 --> 00:15:49,030
immediately after the appearance of the Orc Lord...

248
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:51,775
I have no reason to refuse.

249
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:53,260
However...

250
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:58,110
Souei, was it? I have one condition.

251
00:15:58,780 --> 00:15:59,610
What is it?

252
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:04,190
I wish to meet your master, Rimuru Tempest.

253
00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:06,410
Very well.

254
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:09,640
Then we will make preparations

255
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:12,070
and meet you here in seven days.

256
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:15,480
You will have an audience with him then.

257
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:21,050
Ensure that you do not wage battle before then.

258
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:22,840
Understood.

259
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:24,370
Then I will go.

260
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:32,370
Chieftain!

261
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:38,650
I feel as if I've seen the light of hope.

262
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:42,150
Gather everyone together.

263
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:50,650
The Orc army has already drawn near to this underground cave.

264
00:16:50,650 --> 00:16:53,270
But there is nothing to fear.

265
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:57,420
In seven days, powerful reinforcements will join us.

266
00:16:57,420 --> 00:17:02,660
Until then, we will remain here and conserve our strength for battle.

267
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:07,390
Do not, for a moment, think of making the first strike.

268
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:12,120
Any who die in battle will be eaten by the enemy and become their strength!

269
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:16,440
That is what it means to fight the Orc Lord.

270
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:21,820
Once our reinforcements join us, we will launch a counterattack.

271
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:24,130
Resist fighting until then!

272
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:27,440
I will not tolerate a single death among my men!

273
00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:34,060
All right! Surround him!

274
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,860
Is this really an Orc?

275
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:44,580
I feel like I just fought an Ogre...

276
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:48,980
It's chilling to think that there are 200,000 of these guys.

277
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:51,990
That must be the power of the Orc Lord.

278
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:55,530
Can we defend this place for three more days?

279
00:17:55,530 --> 00:17:58,260
If all we do is defend, we'll exhaust our strength!

280
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:01,480
You're...

281
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:06,150
Father!

282
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:09,400
Ah, you've returned.

283
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:10,450
Well?

284
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:14,790
Did you succeed in recruiting the Goblins to assist us?

285
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:15,837
Yes, sir!

286
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,370
They number 7,000 in total.

287
00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:19,950
They are standing by.

288
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:22,294
But...

289
00:18:22,294 --> 00:18:25,520
Why must we remain here in the face of an Orc attack?

290
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:30,470
This is not how the proud Lizardman race fights.

291
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:35,940
While you were away, we were approached with an offer of alliance.

292
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:41,340
Until they join us, our best option is to focus on defense.

293
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:45,600
You've aged, Father.

294
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:46,850
What?

295
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:58,230
Utilizing these natural labyrinths may be a wise strategy against a large army.

296
00:18:58,230 --> 00:19:02,950
However, it divides our forces between too many separate corridors,

297
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:05,450
preventing us from meeting the enemy with our full strength!

298
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:09,580
G-Gabiru, what is the meaning of this?

299
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:12,010
Be calm, captain of the guard.

300
00:19:12,010 --> 00:19:13,880
I have no intention of harming you.

301
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:15,170
But...

302
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:19,510
I will apologize later for resorting to violence.

303
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:22,030
You may feel uncomfortable while restrained,

304
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:25,010
but bear with it until I defeat the Orc Lord.

305
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:30,140
Son! I will not allow you to do this!

306
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:32,600
Gabiru... no, Brother!

307
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:33,950
Please, come to your senses!

308
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:38,100
Unhand me! Unhand me, I said!

309
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:40,240
Unhand me at once! I will not stand for this!

310
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:44,860
Sir Gabiru, here.

311
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:47,250
That's my father's...

312
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:58,560
Th-This power...

313
00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:03,500
Vortex Spear, you acknowledge me as your master now?

314
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,780
We've seized the leaders of each clan.

315
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:14,670
There were a lot of young ones who didn't agree with this defensive battle.

316
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:16,850
I see.

317
00:20:18,570 --> 00:20:20,700
We're all behind you.

318
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:22,320
We're counting on you, Sir Gabiru.

319
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:25,200
Of course.

320
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:30,120
I will show you how a true Lizardman fights!

321
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:31,700
The time has come!

322
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:38,960
Gabiru! Gabiru! Gabiru!

323
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:46,020
Trample all! Trample all! Trample all!

324
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:49,350
The Orc army filled the marshlands.

325
00:20:49,670 --> 00:20:52,340
From one corner of their ranks, a commotion arose.

326
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:59,520
There is no need to fear these pigs any more than before!

327
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:02,240
These marshlands are our domain!

328
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:05,480
We will throw the Orcs into confusion with our agility!

329
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:09,740
We will not lose to these dimwits whose feet are held by the mud!

330
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:10,880
All right!

331
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,220
Our attack is making a dent!

332
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:13,180
Indeed.

333
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:16,400
Mere Orcs are no match for us Lizardmen!

334
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:19,000
Right! Withdraw for now!

335
00:21:19,810 --> 00:21:23,550
Gabiru's men had to acknowledge his talents.

336
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,260
What's happening?

337
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:31,700
If there was anything they didn't account for,

338
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,020
it was that Gabiru didn't know...

339
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:36,760
the terror of the Orc Lord.

340
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:40,650
The Orcs... are eating other Orcs?

341
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:46,650
The chieftain did know the terror of the Orc Lord.

342
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:51,275
This difference between the two of them was now

343
00:21:51,275 --> 00:21:52,950
bearing its fangs at Gabiru.

344
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:57,790
Trample all! Trample all! Trample all!

345
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:01,500
The strength of this comrade we eat is now ours!

346
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:05,050
The strength of this prey we eat is now ours!

347
00:22:17,224 --> 00:22:23,004
Why is it only those who have hope

348
00:22:23,004 --> 00:22:28,501
To fall into despair from the bottom of their heart?

349
00:22:28,501 --> 00:22:33,425
Why is it only those who have courage

350
00:22:33,425 --> 00:22:39,367
To be wounded at the end of their honor?

351
00:22:39,367 --> 00:22:45,084
I don't want to close my eyes in face of sadness

352
00:22:45,084 --> 00:22:50,713
The dawn for new tomorrow was a mere dream to me

353
00:22:50,713 --> 00:22:56,485
Then I see a light falling through the crack of the night

354
00:22:56,485 --> 00:23:02,936
The sky is crying

355
00:23:03,441 --> 00:23:09,005
I don't know what is there at the corner of the world

356
00:23:09,005 --> 00:23:14,621
All I want is to protect those within my reach

357
00:23:14,621 --> 00:23:20,840
Staring at the only reason to fight

358
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:28,026
We who believe the answer to be forgiveness...

359
00:23:28,026 --> 00:23:32,780
Must not lose!

360
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:38,460
Next time, "The Great Clash."
