1
00:00:00,447 --> 00:00:05,168
Beyond a Fiction that nobody knows,

2
00:00:05,168 --> 00:00:10,523
here I open a nameless Story!

3
00:00:23,394 --> 00:00:28,030
The sky above holds a tomorrow brimming with hope

4
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:33,355
My days were vauge as I'm wondering What's the name?

5
00:00:33,355 --> 00:00:37,919
It took my far-reaching dream that kept me standing in awe

6
00:00:37,919 --> 00:00:43,079
along with my despair and consume them all away

7
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:47,534
My voice has been engraved by the shape of my wish

8
00:00:47,534 --> 00:00:52,051
Make it stronger, stronger, even stronger!

9
00:00:52,051 --> 00:00:55,205
Fly high!

10
00:00:56,906 --> 00:01:01,928
Beyond a Fiction that nobody knows,

11
00:01:01,928 --> 00:01:06,960
There's a slowly sprouting impulse of Skill to stay alive

12
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:11,823
If what I feel right now is Reality, then it will surely be a proof someday

13
00:01:11,823 --> 00:01:16,742
Each one of your story, I shall give a name to it

14
00:01:16,742 --> 00:01:22,053
to the east, to the west, to the high stand up to the period!

15
00:01:22,053 --> 00:01:24,645
Let's go!

16
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:35,400
Rimuru and the Goblins' development of their village continued to progress.

17
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:40,940
Kaijin and the three Dwarf brothers, Garm, Dord, and Myrd,

18
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:44,580
made clothing and tools and built more homes,

19
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:49,420
while the Goblin Lords under Rigurd worked out a system for ruling the village.

20
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:53,120
Everything's going great!

21
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:56,740
Even without my orders, everyone's doing their job.

22
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:58,480
Makes it easier for me!

23
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:03,750
Besides, there's something important I need to do.

24
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:08,520
Good. No one's around.

25
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:15,820
There, all fixed.

26
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:22,280
Shizu-san, I'll take good care of this keepsake of you.

27
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:25,300
Now, then...

28
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:32,330
Transform!

29
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:42,780
This Mimic works really smoothly.

30
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:45,220
An actual human body... Feels great to have this.

31
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:49,890
Vision...

32
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,190
Hearing...

33
00:02:57,590 --> 00:03:02,940
Actually, I think I could see and hear things better as a slime.

34
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:05,790
Because of Magic Sense?

35
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:07,580
So, next...

36
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:11,220
Hey, Great Sage, since I ate Ifrit,

37
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:13,790
can I use body doubles now, too?

38
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:14,880
Answer.

39
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:19,800
All of Ifrit's skills, including Body Double, have been analyzed.

40
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,210
All right, great!

41
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:23,670
I'll try it out right now.

42
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,390
Body Double!

43
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:35,660
I see... It does look like Shizu-san.

44
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:38,305
No trace at all of how I looked when I was alive.

45
00:03:38,305 --> 00:03:42,520
What a beautiful... boy? Girl?

46
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:48,740
Well, I need to know what sex my body is when in human form, right?

47
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:53,080
Though I can kind of already tell...

48
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:57,040
But since I didn't actually check to be sure...

49
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:03,630
My son didn't make it!

50
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:07,200
I seem rather androgynous...

51
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,390
In fact, I have no gender at all!

52
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,140
I'm sexless!

53
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:16,900
Well, I guess I had no gender as a slime, anyway.

54
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:19,450
Wait... Now that I think about it,

55
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:23,400
when I took human form earlier, I didn't see any black mist...

56
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:24,678
Answer.

57
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,010
When using Mimic to assume a form larger than one's own,

58
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:31,660
black mist produced by magicule consumption makes up the difference.

59
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:36,600
Which means... I could create an adult form, too!

60
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,560
All right!

61
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:46,930
Ooh! Can I make it look masculine?

62
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:52,230
Hey, he's pretty handsome!

63
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:55,160
Okay, now make it feminine!

64
00:04:58,340 --> 00:04:59,920
Ooh!

65
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:03,360
Wait, stop! Stop! Go back!

66
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:09,680
I can't do that. Giving myself an adult female form

67
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,450
makes me look like Shizu-san, and that just feels immoral.

68
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:17,210
That concludes my report.

69
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:19,850
Okay, no problems. Good work.

70
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:21,400
Oh, also...

71
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:25,470
Are you sure you will need no food again today?

72
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:29,440
Yeah, I can't taste anything as a slime anywa—

73
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,470
Rigurd!

74
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:34,240
Yes?

75
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,040
I'm gonna eat with you guys starting today!

76
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,060
Truly?!

77
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:41,480
Then we must prepare a lavish feast tonight!

78
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,830
Yeah, do that!

79
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:44,888
Yes, sir!

80
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:50,930
That's right! Since I can mimic a human form now,

81
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:53,210
I'm gonna eat all kinds of tasty food!

82
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:56,940
I wonder what's on the menu...

83
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:59,250
Meat, maybe? There'll probably be meat.

84
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:01,720
Which means I'll want rice, too...

85
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,740
Do they have rice plants in this world?

86
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:05,290
I'll have to look for some eventually.

87
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:08,010
If I find any, I'll make some rice fields...

88
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:11,560
Great Rimuru!

89
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,510
Thanks for always getting our food for us.

90
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:15,430
Thank you, sir.

91
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:17,480
We're just on our way out to the forest.

92
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:21,650
We're having a feast tonight, so bring back some tasty prey!

93
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:24,080
Are you going to eat with us today?

94
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,350
Sure am!

95
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:28,280
This body has a sense of taste, after all.

96
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:32,680
If you eat a lot, I wonder if your boobs will get bigger...

97
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:41,410
I'm sorry! I'll make sure Gobta is strictly disciplined!

98
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:44,500
Anyway, I will prepare some grade-A bulldeer for the feast.

99
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:51,230
Great! Thanks!

100
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:52,510
Just leave it to me.

101
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,120
Many magical beasts have been traveling this way from deep in the forest, lately,

102
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,560
so prey is abundant.

103
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:00,310
Did something happen?

104
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:05,160
No, magical beasts move from place to place as the environment changes.

105
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,320
I don't think it's anything serious.

106
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:15,830
You called, Master?

107
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:19,350
Ranga, go into the forest with Rigur's team.

108
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:22,840
I doubt anything will happen, but just in case.

109
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:25,130
Understood. You can count on me.

110
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:29,130
No need for reservation, Rigur. Take me along.

111
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:32,130
Wow, that was pretty cool, Ranga!

112
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:34,510
Even cooler if you weren't doing that...

113
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:41,400
I paid a visit to the cave where Veldora had been sealed.

114
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:46,520
I wanted to test out Degenerate,

115
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:49,380
the unique skill I'd received from Shizu-san,

116
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:52,300
in a place where it wouldn't disturb anyone.

117
00:07:55,890 --> 00:07:59,320
Regardless of the impression given by the name "Degenerate,"

118
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:02,590
the skill was important to her, and that makes it precious.

119
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:04,040
The skill...

120
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:08,500
uses unification and separation to merge skills together,

121
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,640
evolving them into new skills.

122
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:14,130
In other words, she used it to gain a bunch of new skills.

123
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:15,640
One of them was...

124
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:21,490
What is this? It's creepy...

125
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:25,350
This is the extra skill, Black Flame.

126
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:28,860
I'll have to be careful how I use this one, too.

127
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:36,933
Still...

128
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:40,120
I should really be grateful to Shizu-san.

129
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:45,500
This mask has the power to suppress magic, right?

130
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,300
Let's see.

131
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:49,380
How's this?

132
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:50,240
Answer.

133
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:54,290
The faint aura you were emitting has been completely erased.

134
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,180
In this state, you would be perceived as a human.

135
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:02,430
Okay. I should wear this when I go to new places.

136
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:06,720
Lookin' good!

137
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:08,167
Right.

138
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:10,200
You sound unimpressed.

139
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,210
Great Rimuru!

140
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:15,070
Receiving Thought Communication from: Ranga.

141
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:17,660
Vocal tone indicates that it is a request for aid.

142
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:25,460
I'm gonna die! I'm dead!

143
00:09:27,890 --> 00:09:28,780
What happened?!

144
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:30,650
I got cut! It hurts so bad!

145
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:32,170
Calm down. It's not deep.

146
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:37,130
Who are you guys?

147
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:39,280
Wait... Great Rimuru, it's you!

148
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:41,900
You got worried and came to help?

149
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:43,260
Yeah, that's right.

150
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:45,930
You seem fine, so I guess you don't need any potion.

151
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:47,930
W-Wait! I want some!

152
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:51,150
I'm sorry I joked around like that!

153
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,860
Th-That helped a lot!

154
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:15,380
Ranga!

155
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:20,620
Master, forgive me.

156
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,600
This happened while I was here...

157
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:27,810
Come back, Rigur!

158
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,560
G-Great Rimuru... I am sorry.

159
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:36,610
Don't worry. Leave this to me and get some rest.

160
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:38,700
Thank you...

161
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,580
Ranga, what happened to the ones who've fallen?

162
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,870
They've been put to sleep with magic.

163
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,460
That pink-haired one did it.

164
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:53,480
Magic, huh?

165
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:56,360
Looks like these guys are gonna be trouble.

166
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:04,190
How humiliating. I never thought we would run into Ogres.

167
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:05,220
Ogres?

168
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,870
The ones in games and movies look like this...

169
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,940
But these don't look like that at all.

170
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:16,550
They even have armor on.

171
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:19,950
Also, those look like Japanese swords to me...

172
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:23,240
Six Ogres...

173
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:25,530
Hey, you guys.

174
00:11:25,530 --> 00:11:28,200
I don't know what happened, but sorry about what my guys did.

175
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:30,580
Would you be willing to talk this out?

176
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:36,030
They're clearly much stronger,

177
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:38,960
but Gobta and Rigur weren't fatally wounded,

178
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:42,200
and most of our security force was just put to sleep, not injured.

179
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:44,560
There must be something to it...

180
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,400
Well, I'll just have to be the adult in the room and—

181
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:50,250
Show us who you really are, evil majin!

182
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:51,300
Huh?

183
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:54,130
Hey, hang on! What did you call me?

184
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:58,730
Enslaving monsters is not a feat just any human can accomplish.

185
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,020
Huh?

186
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:04,320
You may hide your appearance and suppress your aura, but it won't work!

187
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,990
Reveal your true identity.

188
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:10,000
For the mastermind to approach us himself is most convenient.

189
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:11,880
Yikes!

190
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:16,220
But my true identity is just a lovable slime...

191
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,210
Hey, listen, guys...

192
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:23,170
We have no intention of listening to you.

193
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:25,470
That mask tells us everything we need to know!

194
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:27,310
My mask?

195
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:30,240
Wait a minute! Aren't you making some kind of mistake?

196
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,200
This is just a keepsake of—

197
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:36,440
If it will serve to repay even a billionth of what was done

198
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,480
to our brethren, we will have your head!

199
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:41,190
You friend of those evil pigs!

200
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:43,400
What shall we do?

201
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,740
Do? I mean...

202
00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:48,240
You take care of the pink-haired one.

203
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,449
Yes, sir.

204
00:12:49,449 --> 00:12:51,090
And don't kill her.

205
00:12:51,090 --> 00:12:52,091
Yes, sir.

206
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:54,590
I think there's more to this.

207
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:56,760
Just get in their way a bit.

208
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,170
I'll take out the rest.

209
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:02,770
But that would mean you'd be taking on five Ogres...

210
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,680
Not a problem.

211
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,300
I won't lose.

212
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:08,570
That's my master!

213
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:09,470
Understood!

214
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,560
You underestimate us.

215
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:15,150
Are you truly brave or just foolhardy?

216
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:18,890
Out of respect for your sheer nerve, I'll go along with your provocation.

217
00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:20,480
I hope you don't regret it later.

218
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,320
You can just take a nap.

219
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:44,630
Sorry, but I saw you with Magic Sense.

220
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:46,630
Huge!

221
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:49,640
Wait, that's not what I meant by "I saw you!"

222
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:50,600
Don't get me wrong!

223
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:57,430
Looks like you're about to fall, miss.

224
00:13:58,030 --> 00:13:59,100
Joke!

225
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:14,450
Way to go!

226
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:16,960
He beat us that easily?

227
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:19,120
So, that just leaves...

228
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:20,820
What'll it be?

229
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:26,420
The Evil Centipede's Paralysis Breath...

230
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:28,990
The Black Spider's Sticky Steel Thread...

231
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:31,680
The Armorsaurus's Body Armor...

232
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:37,590
He may have learned the skills of many other monsters, as well.

233
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:39,690
Do not lower your guard, young master.

234
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:43,360
He named all the skills I used,

235
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,410
and the monsters they came from, from just one look...

236
00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:49,650
I should try not to give too much away.

237
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:51,850
Can we stop this?

238
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:54,490
I'd like you to hear what I have to say now.

239
00:14:54,690 --> 00:14:57,250
Quiet, evil majin!

240
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:59,500
Okay, um... So, listen...

241
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,780
I admit you are strong.

242
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:04,010
That makes me all the more certain.

243
00:15:04,010 --> 00:15:05,435
Certain of what?

244
00:15:05,435 --> 00:15:07,510
You are one of them!

245
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:09,470
Them? Who?

246
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:14,970
It is unthinkable for us Ogres to be defeated by mere Orcs!

247
00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:16,120
Orc?

248
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:18,100
H-Hang on, what makes you—

249
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:18,970
Quiet!

250
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:21,970
I know it was all the work of you and your majin comrades!

251
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:23,520
Huh? Majin?

252
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,547
Don't deny it!

253
00:15:24,547 --> 00:15:26,480
Wait! You've got the wrong—

254
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,050
I must be going senile.

255
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:38,580
I was certain I cut off your head.

256
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:40,480
Are they serious?

257
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,100
Great Rimuru!

258
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:43,420
Y-Your arm!

259
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:45,420
Master!

260
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,180
I'm fine! Don't let your guard down!

261
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:51,400
Did he get under my Magic Sense

262
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:54,930
and easily break through my Multilayer Barrier and Body Armor?

263
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:57,550
Next time, I won't miss.

264
00:15:57,990 --> 00:16:00,680
Looks like you were just foolhardy after all.

265
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:04,790
I commend your courage to remain calm after losing an arm.

266
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:12,110
The pride that compelled you to take us all on alone will be your downfall!

267
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:14,610
Regret your folly in the next life!

268
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:33,760
Did you think you'd beaten me just by cutting off one of my arms?

269
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:36,510
F-Foul beast!

270
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:39,310
Ogre Flame!

271
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,510
Young master...

272
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:49,730
Did I... get him?

273
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:57,730
Too bad.

274
00:16:57,730 --> 00:16:59,690
Fire has no effect on me.

275
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:02,490
You were right, though.

276
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:04,790
I did underestimate you.

277
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:07,250
I'll show you...

278
00:17:08,090 --> 00:17:09,540
what I'm like when I'm serious.

279
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:15,880
What an aura...

280
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,640
Take a good look.

281
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:33,400
That's... That flame is...

282
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:36,770
It's not produced by using the surrounding magicules!

283
00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:40,910
The only thing forming that flame is his pure strength!

284
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:45,790
And the size of the flame mirrors the size of his power...

285
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:49,540
I'll show you something even more interesting.

286
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:52,610
This is my true power!

287
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:04,284
Uh...

288
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:08,760
Maybe I should've kept this one under wraps, after all...

289
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:11,440
What now? Still want to fight?

290
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,730
Good, he's scared.

291
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:17,450
Please just surrender now!

292
00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:20,270
Young master, please take the princess and flee.

293
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:21,510
I will end this.

294
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:22,789
Quiet, old man.

295
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,400
That is intense.

296
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:31,370
It saddens me to say it, but it seems we are no match for you.

297
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:38,890
Still, I have my pride as the next leader of the powerful Ogre clan!

298
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:43,760
And what leader would fail to avenge his slain brethren?!

299
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:48,320
Even if I can't win, I will still fight back!

300
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:52,150
Young master, if you fight, I will fight by your side!

301
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,490
That's their answer?

302
00:18:54,490 --> 00:18:57,620
Well, damn. That backfired on me.

303
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:01,810
Wait, Brother!

304
00:19:01,810 --> 00:19:04,240
This individual may not be our enemy!

305
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:05,440
Move!

306
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,540
No!

307
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:08,790
Why?

308
00:19:09,010 --> 00:19:13,000
He's a masked majin, just like the one who attacked our village!

309
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:14,790
You said so yourself...

310
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:19,810
Yes... but please, try to think this through calmly.

311
00:19:19,810 --> 00:19:23,550
Why would such a powerful majin use such underhanded tactics

312
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:26,520
as forcing the pigs to attack our village?

313
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:27,810
It makes no sense.

314
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:32,310
He surely has the power to kill us all on his own, if he so desired!

315
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:36,070
There is no doubt he is unlike us,

316
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:40,560
but I don't think he has any connection to the ones that attacked our village.

317
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:47,950
Feeling a little more willing to listen now?

318
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,460
I don't need this anymore, right?

319
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:58,070
Who are you?

320
00:19:58,910 --> 00:20:00,173
Me?

321
00:20:00,173 --> 00:20:01,880
I'm just a slime.

322
00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:03,890
A slime?

323
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,300
Yep. Rimuru the slime.

324
00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:14,730
I-It's true...

325
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:19,190
And this mask is a keepsake from someone I knew.

326
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,140
Feel free to see for yourself whether it's the same one

327
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:24,060
that your attacker had.

328
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:27,140
All right...

329
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:30,980
It does seem similar, but...

330
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:35,290
This one contains anti-magic power.

331
00:20:35,490 --> 00:20:40,470
But the majin from back then wasn't concealing their aura...

332
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,064
Then...

333
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,000
Forgive us.

334
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:48,580
It seems our desperation caused a grave misunderstanding.

335
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:51,670
Please accept my apology.

336
00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:53,640
Sure, I accept.

337
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:55,780
Sheesh.

338
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:58,300
For a minute there, I wasn't sure what was gonna happen.

339
00:20:59,810 --> 00:21:01,910
Well, this is no place to talk.

340
00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:03,880
Let's head back to the village.

341
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,400
Come with us.

342
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:07,410
Are you sure?

343
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:08,400
Yep.

344
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,410
I want to hear about what you've been through.

345
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:14,790
But we wounded your companions.

346
00:21:15,090 --> 00:21:17,690
And we did the same to yours.

347
00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:20,300
But no one died, so we'll say it's all good.

348
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:22,450
Forgive us.

349
00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:26,750
Besides, we're having a feast today.

350
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:28,930
The more, the merrier, right?

351
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:36,440
And so, the battle that began before anyone even knew why had ended.

352
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:40,330
The Ogre princess reversed the sleep spell,

353
00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:42,140
and the Goblins awoke.

354
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:45,950
Rimuru healed the Ogres' wounds with his potion,

355
00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:49,620
and the whole gang headed for Rimuru and the Goblins' village.

356
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:52,950
By the way, what's your name.

357
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:56,410
Oh, we have no names.

358
00:21:56,410 --> 00:21:58,960
Oh, yeah. I forgot, most of you don't.

359
00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:01,160
That's right...

360
00:22:02,290 --> 00:22:03,930
That's right...

361
00:22:17,154 --> 00:22:22,934
Why is it only those who have hope

362
00:22:22,934 --> 00:22:28,431
To fall into despair from the bottom of their heart?

363
00:22:28,431 --> 00:22:33,355
Why is it only those who have courage

364
00:22:33,355 --> 00:22:39,297
To be wounded at the end of their honor?

365
00:22:39,297 --> 00:22:45,014
I don't want to close my eyes in face of sadness

366
00:22:45,014 --> 00:22:50,643
The dawn for new tomorrow was a mere dream to me

367
00:22:50,643 --> 00:22:56,415
Then I see a light falling through the crack of the night

368
00:22:56,415 --> 00:23:02,866
The sky is crying

369
00:23:03,371 --> 00:23:08,935
I don't know what is there at the corner of the world

370
00:23:08,935 --> 00:23:14,551
All I want is to protect those within my reach

371
00:23:14,551 --> 00:23:20,770
Staring at the only reason to fight

372
00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:27,956
We who believe the answer to be forgiveness...

373
00:23:27,956 --> 00:23:32,710
Must not lose!

374
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:38,710
Next time, "The Orc Lord."
