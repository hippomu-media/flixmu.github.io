1
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:06,760
Orc Lord...

2
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:08,650
I'm going to put an end to you.

3
00:00:09,424 --> 00:00:14,145
Beyond a Fiction that nobody knows,

4
00:00:14,145 --> 00:00:19,500
here I open a nameless Story!

5
00:00:32,371 --> 00:00:37,007
The sky above holds a tomorrow brimming with hope

6
00:00:37,007 --> 00:00:42,332
My days were vauge as I'm wondering What's the name?

7
00:00:42,332 --> 00:00:46,896
It took my far-reaching dream that kept me standing in awe

8
00:00:46,896 --> 00:00:52,056
along with my despair and consume them all away

9
00:00:52,056 --> 00:00:56,511
My voice has been engraved by the shape of my wish

10
00:00:56,511 --> 00:01:01,028
Make it stronger, stronger, even stronger!

11
00:01:01,028 --> 00:01:04,182
Fly high!

12
00:01:05,883 --> 00:01:10,905
Beyond a Fiction that nobody knows,

13
00:01:10,905 --> 00:01:15,937
There's a slowly sprouting impulse of Skill to stay alive

14
00:01:15,937 --> 00:01:20,800
If what I feel right now is Reality, then it will surely be a proof someday

15
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:25,719
Each one of your story, I shall give a name to it

16
00:01:25,719 --> 00:01:31,030
to the east, to the west, to the high stand up to the period!

17
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:33,622
Let's go!

18
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,320
Are you a majin?

19
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:12,520
What's the big idea?!

20
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:16,690
How dare you ruin the great Lord Gelmud's plans?!

21
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:18,340
Gelmud?

22
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:20,610
Gelmud is—

23
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:23,470
The one who named Rigurd's eldest son, right?

24
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:25,240
Y-Yes.

25
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:31,000
A new Demon Lord who would have done my bidding was about to be born!

26
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:32,880
A new...

27
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:34,230
...Demon Lord?

28
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:35,763
Yes!

29
00:02:35,763 --> 00:02:39,300
That's why I gave out so many names, sowed so many seeds!

30
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:42,760
All to create the ultimate pawn!

31
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:45,140
And that is why...

32
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,970
...you showed up...

33
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:48,680
...in our village?

34
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:54,150
Oh! It's Lord Gelmud!

35
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:57,390
That's the one who gave Sir Gabiru his name?

36
00:02:57,390 --> 00:02:58,650
What brings you here?

37
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:01,040
Could it be you've come to help us?

38
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,960
You useless dolt!

39
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:03,780
Huh?

40
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:07,209
Just become a meal for the Orc Lord already!

41
00:03:07,209 --> 00:03:08,290
Huh?!

42
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:10,790
What is he talking about?

43
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:15,890
A useless fool like you will never be more than a nuisance!

44
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:19,550
So be eaten by the Orc Lord and become his strength!

45
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:24,300
You'll be useful to me in death. Consider it an honor.

46
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:26,810
G-Gero... G-Gel...

47
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,290
Get him, Orc Lord!

48
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:36,000
What's the matter?

49
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:40,900
What do you mean by evolving into a Demon Lord?

50
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:44,470
Tsk... You really are an imbecile.

51
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:48,410
You will become the Demon Lord "Orc Disaster"

52
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:50,500
and rule over the entire Forest of Jura!

53
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:55,000
That is what both he and I desire!

54
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:57,050
Who's "he"?

55
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:02,440
Why are you just standing there, you dumb pig?!

56
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:08,140
There's no time. I'm not supposed to interfere, but I have no choice.

57
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:11,130
Sir Gabiru!

58
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:12,430
You must flee!

59
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:13,850
Die!

60
00:04:20,330 --> 00:04:21,560
You guys!

61
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:25,450
Sir Gabiru, you're all right...

62
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:27,530
Thank goodness...

63
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:43,010
Lord Gelmud!

64
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:48,510
Become nourishment for the Orc Lord, and be useful to me!

65
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:54,640
I will show you the strength of a superior majin!

66
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,440
Die!

67
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:59,610
Deathmarch Dance!

68
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:03,880
Lord Gelmud!

69
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:18,330
Huh?!

70
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,340
Hey, is that the best you can do?

71
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:24,970
How's a move like that going to kill anyone?

72
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,260
Y-You...

73
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:31,060
You... You are...

74
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:32,340
Here!

75
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,770
They're healing potions. Use them on your men.

76
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:40,690
R-Right!

77
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:42,920
Stay strong!

78
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:45,940
You went through all this for me...

79
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,338
Now...

80
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:52,410
What is this?!

81
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:54,570
So this guy is the one behind all this.

82
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:57,270
I can't believe Gabiru was fooled by someone like him.

83
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:01,420
But I've grown to like Gabiru.

84
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:04,900
That's all the reason I need to help him.

85
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:08,970
H-How dare you do this to a superior maji—

86
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:14,810
Why, you! I'll—

87
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:23,570
You keep saying you're some bigshot "superior majin," but you're nothing special.

88
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:26,570
Okay, I get it! You can be on my side! I'll—

89
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:36,450
Damn you! You're finished! He's going to make you regret this!

90
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:41,280
Why don't you tell me just who "he" is?

91
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,390
Tell me who's pulling the strings.

92
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,900
Stop! Stay away!

93
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:48,340
Hey, Orc Lord! Help me!

94
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:52,340
I'm hungry.

95
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:55,750
Damn it! I said help me, Orc Lord!

96
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,680
No, I mean... Geld!

97
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:01,970
Your name is Geld.

98
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,010
Geld...

99
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:10,370
One day, you will take possession of the Great Forest of Jura

100
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:13,210
and become the Orc Disaster.

101
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:18,950
If you'd hurry up and evolve into a Demon Lord...

102
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:28,660
Finally moving now, you scumbag?

103
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:34,460
Prepare to experience this beast's strength!

104
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:38,470
Do it, Geld! Make them rue the day they defied m—

105
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:49,540
Gelmud's life signs have ceased.

106
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:52,110
Yeah, I can see that.

107
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:03,980
He's eating him...

108
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:13,930
Confirmed.

109
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:17,510
The Orc Lord Geld's magicules have vastly increased.

110
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:20,010
Evolution to Demon Lord is beginning.

111
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:29,720
Successful.

112
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:35,660
Geld has evolved into the Orc Disaster.

113
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:40,140
Orc Disaster, Geld, the Demon Lord...

114
00:08:41,170 --> 00:08:43,350
I can't just sit and do nothing about this.

115
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:51,010
I am the Orc Disaster!

116
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:54,760
I am the one who will devour all in this world!

117
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,010
My name is Geld...

118
00:08:57,490 --> 00:09:00,750
Geld the Demon Lord!

119
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:06,810
If I don't kill him now, it really will be a disaster.

120
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,020
-Shion! -Right! On it!

121
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:14,090
Hey...

122
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:15,820
Let us handle this.

123
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:18,660
You call yourself a Demon Lord?!

124
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:20,330
Curb your ego, you foul pig!

125
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,217
He got him!

126
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:03,530
That's some insane healing power.

127
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,550
Arcane Thread Fetters!

128
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,180
Do it, Benimaru!

129
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:21,350
Have some of this!

130
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,850
Out of magicules?

131
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:41,250
I'm so sorry!

132
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,060
Just hang out in my shadow.

133
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:44,005
Yes, master!

134
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:52,326
What is...

135
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:58,490
No way...

136
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:03,980
So this... is pain?

137
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,450
You're kidding me...

138
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,940
My king, I offer my body to you.

139
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:34,210
Self-regeneration and healing magic?

140
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:37,730
Not enough! I need more!

141
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:40,840
Give me more food!

142
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Great Rimuru...

143
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,310
Don't worry. I've got this.

144
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:02,580
I have a trick up my sleeve, too.

145
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:03,950
It's a bit cowardly, though...

146
00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:08,630
You're up, Great Sage!

147
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:12,330
I'm counting on you! Defeat my enemy at once!

148
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:16,790
Understood. Switching to auto-battle mode.

149
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:24,630
Let's see what Great Sage can do.

150
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:29,600
Devour all! Chaos Eater!

151
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:47,040
Wow, nice! I knew I could count on Great Sage!

152
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:53,000
Impossible!

153
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:06,470
My Lord!

154
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:19,230
This time, I will eat you!

155
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:35,600
I'm going to devour you right now!

156
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:44,380
Flare Circle! This'll do it!

157
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,040
Operation complete.

158
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:50,390
Way to go, Great Sage! That went perfectly!

159
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:52,390
But...

160
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:02,960
An emergency has arisen.

161
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:06,630
Of course... He has fire resistance now.

162
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,360
I figured as much.

163
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:12,010
Immediately recalculating—

164
00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:13,160
I'll take over, Great Sage.

165
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:15,920
Don't feel bad.

166
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:19,170
I think I've figured out how to defeat him, thanks to you.

167
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:23,340
So just leave the rest to me, partner.

168
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:32,890
It appears fire has no effect on me.

169
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:37,930
Is that right? You might have been happier burning to death.

170
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:41,140
I've acknowledged you as an enemy.

171
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:44,440
Now I'll take you on for real.

172
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:47,070
Laughable!

173
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:49,960
Does that mean you weren't serious before now?

174
00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:53,200
There is nothing more you can do!

175
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,430
Just accept that I'm going to eat you!

176
00:14:58,290 --> 00:15:02,340
Before you can eat me, I'm going to eat you.

177
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:06,380
I'm a slime.

178
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:08,280
Wha—

179
00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:12,720
Wh-Why, you...

180
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:16,600
You're not the only one who can eat things!

181
00:15:18,370 --> 00:15:20,730
Will you eat me first...

182
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,831
or will I eat you first?

183
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,420
The one who completely consumes the other wins!

184
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:55,380
Between your Starved

185
00:15:57,350 --> 00:15:58,970
and my Predator...

186
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:00,700
Which is stronger?

187
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:03,920
The winner will be my Predator...

188
00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:08,780
Rather, if you are "Starved," then I am...

189
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:11,970
a "Devourer"!

190
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:30,980
Are you hungry? Wait just a moment.

191
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:40,740
Here. Eat it.

192
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:46,470
Eat well, and grow up big and strong.

193
00:16:47,770 --> 00:16:49,820
My king, please don't do this.

194
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:54,390
In this great famine, if we were to lose even you,

195
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:57,870
nothing would await us but despair.

196
00:16:59,330 --> 00:17:02,090
The child born only two days ago died this morning.

197
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:05,280
The child born yesterday is at death's door.

198
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:09,500
My body will always regenerate any parts I tear off, but this...

199
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:15,830
If this is not a state of despair already, what else is it?

200
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:17,810
My king...

201
00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:22,250
I will go into the forest to search for food.

202
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:26,820
But the Forest of Jura has the divine protection of the Storm Dragon!

203
00:17:28,810 --> 00:17:31,990
The Storm Dragon has long been sealed away.

204
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:36,340
I must seek even the slightest blessing.

205
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:43,500
I'm so hungry...

206
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:47,540
I want to eat something... anything...

207
00:17:49,370 --> 00:17:52,090
I will give you a name and some food.

208
00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:56,340
Who are you?

209
00:17:56,990 --> 00:17:58,840
Gelmud.

210
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:01,590
Think of me as your father.

211
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:10,150
He told me that anyone I ate as the Orc Lord

212
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:13,610
would not die, being under the control of Starved.

213
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:17,690
It appears he was merely using me as a pawn in his evil scheme,

214
00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:19,560
but I had to take the risk.

215
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,270
That is why I must eat.

216
00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:27,210
Even if you are a slime that can eat anything,

217
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:30,170
I cannot let myself be eaten.

218
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:33,880
When it comes to eating, I have the advantage. You'll lose.

219
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,980
I ate all the monsters I encountered...

220
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,640
I ate Lord Gelmud.

221
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:43,300
I even ate my brethren.

222
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:45,890
My brethren are starving.

223
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:49,230
So I cannot lose.

224
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:55,640
In this world, it's eat or be eaten.

225
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:59,980
You've lost, so you're going to die.

226
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:03,410
I cannot lose.

227
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:07,410
If I die, my sins fall upon my brethren's shoulders.

228
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:10,670
It matters not if I am sinful.

229
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:13,670
To ensure that they don't starve,

230
00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:16,670
I must take all the world's hunger upon myself.

231
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:20,570
You're still going to die.

232
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:26,240
But rest easy. I'll devour all your sins along with you.

233
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,180
Devour... my sins?

234
00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:32,570
Yeah, and not just you.

235
00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:35,640
I'll devour the sins of all your brethren, too.

236
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:40,360
Even the sins of my brethren?

237
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:44,370
You are greedy.

238
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:48,700
You're right. I am greedy.

239
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,630
Greedy one...

240
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:20,360
One who devours my sins...

241
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:22,990
I thank you.

242
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:25,700
My hunger has now...

243
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,540
been sated.

244
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,320
Confirmed.

245
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,630
The Orc Disaster is gone.

246
00:20:47,670 --> 00:20:50,790
Rest in peace, Geld.

247
00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:57,610
With the Orc Lord defeated, the effects of Starved also vanished.

248
00:20:58,150 --> 00:21:02,010
At that moment, the advance of the Orcs was halted.

249
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,470
My king...

250
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,160
You've finally been set free.

251
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,380
I guess it's over.

252
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:23,739
Yes.

253
00:21:23,739 --> 00:21:27,980
I promised that you'd be free once the Orc Lord was defeated.

254
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:30,021
Thanks for all your help.

255
00:21:31,610 --> 00:21:34,480
Great Rimuru, I have a favor to ask.

256
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,350
What is it?

257
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:39,530
Please accept our allegiance.

258
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:43,230
We will continue to serve you.

259
00:21:44,450 --> 00:21:45,780
You're sure?

260
00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:48,240
I have no objections.

261
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:52,080
We are truly fortunate to have met you.

262
00:21:54,450 --> 00:21:57,650
I'm your secretary and bodyguard, Great Rimuru!

263
00:21:57,650 --> 00:21:59,710
I'll never leave your side!

264
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:02,650
Not until the ends of our lives.

265
00:22:02,650 --> 00:22:04,630
O-Okay...

266
00:22:05,513 --> 00:22:12,394
I have to believe in me that you believe in

267
00:22:12,394 --> 00:22:20,858
A story just started, carrying a name

268
00:22:22,326 --> 00:22:29,050
Whether it's a concidence or a fate, who cares?

269
00:22:29,050 --> 00:22:34,787
Just pick one thing in here

270
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:42,242
Just from one chance, the future would change

271
00:22:42,242 --> 00:22:48,737
Along with the sky, the wind, and the land

272
00:22:48,737 --> 00:22:55,762
It's all because you keep believing in that possiblity

273
00:22:55,762 --> 00:23:02,315
That I can also keep believing. With my power...

274
00:23:02,315 --> 00:23:05,643
In the depths of the world that we must protect,

275
00:23:05,643 --> 00:23:08,997
rise up as many times as it take

276
00:23:08,997 --> 00:23:15,064
If I can't hold it with both hands, I'll lend it to you

277
00:23:15,674 --> 00:23:22,368
Even if you got shaken, face foward for the smile you wish to protect

278
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:27,294
There's a scenary I want to show you,

279
00:23:27,294 --> 00:23:29,815
let's go togehter

280
00:23:36,050 --> 00:23:39,100
Next time, "The Jura Forest Alliance."
