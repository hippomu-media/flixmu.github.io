1
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:29,700
Mommy! What about the bomb shelter?

2
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:31,390
Mommy!

3
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:06,090
Sure is peaceful...

4
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:12,940
I live a totally normal, uneventful life.

5
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:17,380
I graduated from college, got a job at a major general contracting firm,

6
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:20,840
worked my way up the ladder, and started making decent money.

7
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:23,230
I'm a perfectly content 37-year-old man.

8
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:29,150
If there's anything missing in my life right now, it's a girlfriend.

9
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:33,150
In fact, I haven't had a girlfriend in all my 37 years...

10
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:37,540
But not having one doesn't bother me at all, really.

11
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:39,990
Senpai!

12
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,860
Over here, Senpai!

13
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:46,530
Tamura, sorry I'm a bit late.

14
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:48,430
So, what'd you want to discuss?

15
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:51,360
Hello! I'm Sawatari Miho.

16
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,760
I see you around a lot, but this is our first time speaking.

17
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:58,410
Oh... Hi. I'm Mikami Satoru.

18
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:00,680
I know who you are, of course. You're famous.

19
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:02,470
What?! Famous?!

20
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:05,230
Yeah, I mean, all those rumors...

21
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,020
Wh-What rumors?!

22
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:10,920
Easy, Miho. He's just teasing you.

23
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:13,320
Go easy on her, Senpai.

24
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:14,880
Sorry about that.

25
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:18,820
What is this, anyway? Is he looking for marriage advice?

26
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:22,130
No need to stand around. Let's talk while we eat.

27
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:24,190
You like yakiniku, don't you, Senpai?

28
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:26,240
I booked a great place for us.

29
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:29,820
Jeez, he arranged one of my favorites for dinner?

30
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:31,460
Kid sure knows how to treat his senpai.

31
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:33,040
It's just up ahead.

32
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:36,720
Well, I guess I should offer them my congratulations.

33
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:45,810
Tamura!

34
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:06,050
S-Senpai!

35
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:10,540
Wh-What is this?

36
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:12,900
It's too hot...

37
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:15,750
I don't... want this...

38
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:17,960
Confirmed.

39
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,790
Heat Resistance acquisition successful.

40
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:25,760
How the hell could I get stabbed and die?!

41
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,100
Confirmed.

42
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:30,450
Stab Resistance acquisition successful.

43
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:31,230
Continuing...

44
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:36,150
Physical Attack Resistance acquisition successful.

45
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:38,280
We need an ambulance! Quick!

46
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:41,340
It hurts... The blood...

47
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:42,900
Confirmed.

48
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,720
Pain Nullification acquired.

49
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,910
Creating a body that does not require blood.

50
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:48,790
Successful.

51
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:53,850
Would you... shut up already, Tamura?

52
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:57,090
Senpai, hang in there!

53
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:58,800
So cold...

54
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,250
Cold Resistance acquisition successful.

55
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:06,650
Acquisition of Heat Resistance and Cold Resistance

56
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:09,700
results in acquisition of new skill, Thermal Fluctuation Resistance.

57
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:11,770
Am I... gonna die?

58
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:15,010
T-Tamura...

59
00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:20,650
Take the hard drive out of my computer at home...

60
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:24,690
put it in the bath... and make sure it's completely wiped.

61
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:25,520
Huh?

62
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,100
Deletion of data via electric current

63
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:30,410
has failed due to insufficient information.

64
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:32,870
As an alternate measure,

65
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:34,590
Electric Current Resistance acquired.

66
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:36,880
Attached is Paralysis Resistance.

67
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,210
Acquisition successful.

68
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:40,370
Senpai...

69
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:42,590
Please...

70
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:48,640
All I really wanted to do... was show off Sawatari to you...

71
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,470
Jeez...

72
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:54,050
Don't worry about that.

73
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:55,450
Mikami-san...

74
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,770
Be sure to make her happy.

75
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:02,900
And take care of my computer.

76
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:09,070
I never thought I'd die a virgin...

77
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:12,240
If I'm reborn, I'll be a lot more aggressive.

78
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:14,260
I'll screw every girl I see...

79
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:19,170
Unique skill: Predator acquisition successful.

80
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,840
If a guy who's still a virgin at 30 is a magician,

81
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:28,420
then, given how close I was to 40, I would've been a sage.

82
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:31,570
I could've even made it to the rank of great sage.

83
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:34,850
Extra skill: Sage acquisition successful.

84
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:38,980
Continuing, Sage will transform into the unique skill Great Sage.

85
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,590
Successful.

86
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,980
Oh, shut up...

87
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:49,620
Just let me... have some... quiet time...

88
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,720
Senpai...

89
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,040
Senpai!

90
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:03,340
I can't see anything.

91
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,990
Where am I?

92
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,630
And... what happened?

93
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:13,870
I feel like someone was teasing me about being a sage, or a great sage...

94
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:16,890
That's right... I was stabbed and...

95
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:20,490
Okay, I remember. It's all right.

96
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:22,320
This isn't the time to panic yet.

97
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:28,780
The only time I ever lost my cool was when I crapped my pants in grade school.

98
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:32,830
Okay, so... I was stabbed, and then...

99
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:37,750
I don't... hurt anywhere.

100
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:39,830
I'm not cold.

101
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:43,330
My eyes... won't open?

102
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:45,380
I can't see anything!

103
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:47,880
My hands... my feet...

104
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:50,590
I can't feel them.

105
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,020
My body...

106
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:57,050
I can move!

107
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,390
So I have sensation.

108
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,900
Are those... rocks?

109
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:08,530
Which would mean I'm not in the hospital...

110
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:10,940
Then, where the hell am I?

111
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:14,430
Is this...

112
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:16,660
some kind of plant?

113
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:19,190
Does my mouth work?

114
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,170
My voice...

115
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:23,710
Nope.

116
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:26,700
Huh? It dissolved?

117
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:33,220
It's permeating throughout my body...

118
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:39,610
What's happened to me?

119
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,810
Something seems weird.

120
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:46,620
Humans can't usually dissolve plants, can they?

121
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,610
Oh... Huh? Eh?

122
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:52,830
Maybe I really did die...

123
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:55,550
What happened to Tamura and Sawatari-san?

124
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:58,040
Did he wipe my hard drive?

125
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:03,010
Just... what the heck am I right now?

126
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:10,320
Hey, I bounce. I seem to have some elasticity.

127
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:13,380
Let's see, my body's exterior is...

128
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,640
Uh-huh.

129
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,140
I see, I see.

130
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,730
How can this be?!

131
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:24,990
I was such a hot, manly man (self-proclaimed),

132
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:28,190
but now I've taken on this refined, streamlined form!

133
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:31,920
Yeah, right, idiot! Like hell I can accept that!

134
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:35,240
But... I am a slime, aren't I?

135
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,700
Yeah. I'm not human.

136
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:43,170
It seems like I got stabbed, died, and reincarnated...

137
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,290
as a slime.

138
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:50,390
I think it's been a fairly long time since then.

139
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:55,820
Surprisingly, it turns out this body is pretty handy.

140
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:59,140
I don't even need to eat or sleep.

141
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,700
So why do I eat plants, you ask?

142
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:06,980
Because I have nothing else to do!

143
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:10,980
There's no point, but I don't feel right if I'm not doing something.

144
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:13,990
Wait... Who am I even talking to?

145
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:17,980
Anyway, I wonder where this stuff I eat is going.

146
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:19,350
I haven't pooped or...

147
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:19,830
Answer.

148
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:24,500
It is stored in the stomach of your unique skill, Predator.

149
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:27,910
Th-That voice... I heard it when I was stabbed, too!

150
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:29,000
Wh-Who are you?

151
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:30,630
Answer.

152
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:33,460
It is the effect of your unique skill, Great Sage.

153
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:35,160
Now that your ability is established,

154
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:38,300
you are capable of reacting more quickly.

155
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:39,970
Great Sage...

156
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:42,910
So, um, does "skill" mean my abilities?

157
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:44,560
What is "Predator"?

158
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,060
It allows you to ingest objects and analyze them within your body.

159
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:51,330
You can then acquire that object's skills.

160
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:54,070
Once the analysis is complete, you can mimic the object, as well.

161
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:55,240
Oh!

162
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,680
The stomach stores the objects you ingest.

163
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:01,670
It can also isolate harmful objects that cannot be analyzed.

164
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:05,880
Th-This "Predator" seems like a pretty amazing ability.

165
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:08,360
Is it really something a slime should have?

166
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:10,790
But, hey, since I do have it...

167
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:13,500
As a test, can you analyze the plants I ate?

168
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:18,080
Analysis complete.

169
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,590
Hipokute herbs.

170
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:23,320
A valuable herb that only grows in areas rich in magicules.

171
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,770
Used as an ingredient in salves and healing potions.

172
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,020
Magicules?

173
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,340
Magicules.

174
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:30,440
A special energetic material found in all—

175
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:33,150
Explain it so I can understand!

176
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:38,450
They are the building blocks of life in all magical beings.

177
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:40,210
Building blocks of life?

178
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:43,200
I get it. This cave must be full of that stuff,

179
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,350
which is why all these valuable herbs grow here, right?

180
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:49,420
So I can analyze these hipokute herbs

181
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,640
and store them in my stomach.

182
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:55,670
Does that mean I can create and store salves and healing potions

183
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:57,450
within my own body?

184
00:10:57,450 --> 00:10:58,770
Precisely.

185
00:10:58,770 --> 00:11:00,020
I see!

186
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:01,180
Okay, then...

187
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:05,180
So I gobbled up all the hipokute herbs in this cave

188
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:10,100
and immediately turned them into potions in my stomach along the way.

189
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:12,150
They could come in handy if I'm ever in trouble...

190
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:15,190
but mostly, I just have nothing else to do.

191
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:22,300
If all those plants are actually some valuable herb you call hipokute herbs,

192
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:24,370
does that mean this rock is worth something, too?

193
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:26,140
Magic ore.

194
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:28,710
Minerals that spend long periods of time in magicule-rich areas

195
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:32,160
take in magicules until they become magic ore.

196
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,880
It is very valuable.

197
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,630
Really?! Okay, then!

198
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:40,730
Magic ore's pretty awesome, too!

199
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:46,700
So I gobbled up all the magic ore in the cave.

200
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:48,690
And there's a ton of it!

201
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:52,280
It's an all-you-can-eat buffet!

202
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:04,650
Um... Did I just... fall in water?

203
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:06,200
A lake?

204
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:09,280
So slimes don't float?

205
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:12,210
Am I really gonna die this time?

206
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,260
I don't feel like I'm suffocating.

207
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:17,790
Wait, was I even breathing to begin with?

208
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:19,650
I guess I wasn't...

209
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:22,370
But what do I do now?

210
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,170
This looks bad.

211
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:25,760
I know!

212
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:28,640
I'll just ingest some water and...

213
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:31,810
Okay!

214
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:34,930
Skill: Water Pressure Propulsion acquired.

215
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:39,400
W-Wait... I'm going a little too fast!

216
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:50,040
I'm pretty sure I hit that wall, but I don't feel any pain.

217
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:51,100
Answer.

218
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:53,470
Because you have acquired Pain Nullification,

219
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:55,300
you will not feel pain.

220
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:58,050
The physical damage you have taken is 10%.

221
00:12:58,050 --> 00:13:01,260
Species skill Self-Regeneration has been activated.

222
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:04,350
So I still take damage, even though I don't feel pain?

223
00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:12,370
I repaired the part of me that took damage?

224
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:14,650
This body really is convenient!

225
00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:18,020
But I guess I should be more careful.

226
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:21,930
Can you hear me, small one?

227
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:29,730
Can you hear me, small one?

228
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,740
Hey! I know you can hear me!

229
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:35,250
Y-You're talking to me, aren't you?

230
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:37,380
Answer me.

231
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:38,970
Easy for you to say!

232
00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:41,340
How am I supposed to talk when I don't have a mouth?!

233
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:42,420
Hey!

234
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:44,590
Just shut up already, baldy!

235
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:48,840
Oh? You called me a baldy, eh?

236
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,560
I see you have guts.

237
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:51,560
Uh...

238
00:13:59,810 --> 00:14:04,190
I was trying to be nice since I haven't had a visitor in so long,

239
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:06,570
but you seem to have a death wish.

240
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:08,160
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

241
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,290
I had no idea you could hear my thoughts!

242
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:12,740
I don't have a mouth or even eyes, you see...

243
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:22,590
It amazed me that you would say such a thing after seeing me,

244
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:24,620
but it turns out you can't see me, eh?

245
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:27,510
All right. I will give you sight.

246
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:28,580
Huh?

247
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:31,960
However, there will be conditions.

248
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,010
What do you say?

249
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:35,160
What sort of conditions?

250
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,660
It's simple.

251
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:40,640
You must not fear me when you have the ability to see me,

252
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:43,020
and you must come talk to me again.

253
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,850
That's all.

254
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:46,860
A good deal for you, is it not?

255
00:14:47,810 --> 00:14:49,960
That's all I have to do?

256
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:54,910
Yes. You see, I was sealed here 300 years ago.

257
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:59,880
Ever since then, I've had nothing to do, and it's unbearably boring.

258
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:00,960
What do you say?

259
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:03,380
I'm curious as to why you were sealed, but...

260
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:05,420
Okay, I'll gladly do it!

261
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:08,820
Very well. There is a skill called Magic Sense.

262
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:09,930
Can you use it?

263
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:11,680
No, I can't.

264
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:14,430
It allows you to sense the magicules around you.

265
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:18,300
If I can detect magicules, I'll be able to see?

266
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:20,430
Okay, I guess I'll try it.

267
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:27,920
Hey, there's something...

268
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,580
Is this the stuff you call magicules?

269
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:36,000
Extra skill: Magic Sense acquired.

270
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,320
That easily?!

271
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,910
Also, "extra"?

272
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:43,330
Skills with power and efficiency magnitudes higher than those of normal skills.

273
00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:45,590
Wow! "Extra" sounds awesome!

274
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:47,570
Would you like to use Magic Sense?

275
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:48,630
Yes!

276
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:57,010
I can see!

277
00:15:57,010 --> 00:15:58,060
I can see!

278
00:15:58,060 --> 00:15:59,680
I can actually see!

279
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,490
Oh, yeah!

280
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,910
I really am a slime.

281
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:08,910
Well?

282
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:09,990
Oh, right!

283
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:11,140
I did it!

284
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:12,970
Thanks so much!

285
00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:18,780
D-Dragon?!

286
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:32,540
Allow me to formally introduce myself.

287
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,640
O-Okay...

288
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,590
I am the Storm Dragon, Veldora.

289
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:39,140
Storm Dragon?

290
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:43,500
I am one of only four True Dragons that exist in this world.

291
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,780
Hey, you do remember our promise, don't you?

292
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:55,770
O-Of course! I'm not scared at all!

293
00:16:55,770 --> 00:16:57,800
Well, I'll come to chat again sometime!

294
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:58,450
Hold it!

295
00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:01,540
This is indeed unusual.

296
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:04,720
Slimes are normally low-ranked monsters that don't think,

297
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,830
but you have self-awareness.

298
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:08,210
Are you Unique?

299
00:17:08,210 --> 00:17:10,200
What does "Unique" mean?

300
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:13,030
It refers to a being with extraordinary abilities.

301
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:15,220
I'm not really sure.

302
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:18,840
The thing is, I used to be a human,

303
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:22,700
but I got stabbed and died, and next thing I knew, I looked like this.

304
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:25,440
I see. You were reincarnated.

305
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:26,630
Reincarnated...

306
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:30,110
So I really was reborn as a slime...

307
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:33,860
You came into this world in a very unusual way.

308
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:35,860
Huh? Unusual?

309
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:38,970
There are occasionally those who come here from other worlds,

310
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:42,070
but you are the first I've known of to be reincarnated here.

311
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:45,870
Most would be unable to withstand having only their soul traverse worlds.

312
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:47,090
So you're saying

313
00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:51,250
there are people who came here from other worlds, but not through reincarnation?

314
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:55,010
Indeed. We call them Otherworlders.

315
00:17:55,370 --> 00:18:00,760
I've heard that they gain special abilities when they cross into this world.

316
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:04,340
I see... I guess that's how I got my skills, too.

317
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:07,440
There might even be other Japanese people here...

318
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:11,270
I think I'd like to try and find some of these Otherworlders.

319
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:14,120
What? You're leaving already?

320
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,760
He's pouting!

321
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:19,350
U-Um... Maybe I'll stay a little longer.

322
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:21,280
It's not like I have anything to do...

323
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:24,410
Oh, good! Stay as long as you like!

324
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:31,040
So, um, you said earlier that you were sealed here, right?

325
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:33,210
I'm glad you asked that!

326
00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:36,940
It was 300 years ago...

327
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:41,930
I sort of turned a town into ashes by mistake.

328
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:43,660
"Sort of"?

329
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:47,160
So someone came looking to slay me.

330
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,810
It's certainly true that I underestimated my opponent a bit.

331
00:18:51,050 --> 00:18:54,070
I started putting my full strength into the battle partway through...

332
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:56,820
But I still lost!

333
00:18:57,210 --> 00:18:59,630
But you seem really strong.

334
00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:02,070
Was your opponent that powerful?

335
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:04,380
Yes, very powerful.

336
00:19:04,930 --> 00:19:08,080
It was someone known to the humans as a hero blessed with divine protection.

337
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:13,140
A human hero? Sounds like something out of a video game.

338
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:17,200
She overpowered me with her unique skill, Absolute Severance,

339
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:21,050
and then she sealed me using Unlimited Imprisonment.

340
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:25,850
Is that shiny stuff her Unlimited Imprisonment?

341
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:27,240
Yes.

342
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:31,440
The hero called herself a "Summon."

343
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:33,490
A Summon?

344
00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:35,860
Is that different from Otherworlders?

345
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:40,310
It takes more than 30 mages to perform a ritual that lasts several days

346
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:42,110
to bring one here from another world.

347
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:44,640
Oh! So there are mages here!

348
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,370
This sounds more and more like a game!

349
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:50,000
They're also expected to serve as powerful weapons.

350
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,140
Weapons?

351
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:53,110
Yes, for the Summoner.

352
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:55,940
Magic is used to carve a curse into the Summon's soul

353
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:58,630
to ensure that the Summon can't defy the Summoner.

354
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:01,630
What the heck?! That's just cruel!

355
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,200
Cruel, eh?

356
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:05,760
I don't know what your world was like,

357
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:10,090
but survival of the fittest is the prevailing truth in this world.

358
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:11,910
I see...

359
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:16,900
So you've been in here ever since that hero sealed you?

360
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:19,170
That's right.

361
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:21,660
I'm so very bored...

362
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:27,570
I felt pretty damn lonely just because I never had a girlfriend in 37 years...

363
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:30,650
I can't imagine being all alone for 300 years.

364
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:32,080
Okay!

365
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:34,580
Why don't you and I be friends?

366
00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:41,180
What?! A mere slime proposes friendship with me, the feared Storm Dragon?!

367
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:43,340
I-If you don't want to, I understand...

368
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:47,100
F-Fool! No one said I didn't want to!

369
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:50,100
Uh, really? Then... what do you say?

370
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:53,640
Yes, well... if you insist...

371
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:56,690
I guess I'm willing to think about it.

372
00:20:56,690 --> 00:20:57,900
Are you some tsundere?!

373
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:01,000
Yes, I insist! So that settles it!

374
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,150
If you refuse, we're through. I'll never come here again!

375
00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:07,700
W-Well, all right. I'll be your friend. You'd better be grateful!

376
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:09,860
Just can't be honest, can you?

377
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:11,200
Well, glad to know ya!

378
00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:13,030
I-Indeed.

379
00:21:14,810 --> 00:21:19,120
It's a little embarrassing talking about "friends" at my age...

380
00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:23,840
But that's the story of how I got stabbed, died,

381
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,600
reincarnated as a slime,

382
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,290
and became friends with the Storm Dragon Veldora.

383
00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:33,380
My totally normal, uneventful life... is no more.

384
00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:35,620
How could this have happened?

385
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:37,890
I never dreamed a life like this was waiting for me!

386
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:40,480
Or should I call it a "slife"?

387
00:21:41,290 --> 00:21:44,760
I wonder if Tamura wiped my hard drive for me...

388
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:47,560
I hope he didn't look at it first.

389
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:58,820
Rest in peace, Senpai.

390
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:03,390
If I ever have a son, I'll name him Satoru.

391
00:22:05,464 --> 00:22:10,185
Beyond a Fiction that nobody knows,

392
00:22:10,185 --> 00:22:15,540
here I open a nameless Story!

393
00:22:28,411 --> 00:22:33,047
The sky above holds a tomorrow brimming with hope

394
00:22:33,047 --> 00:22:38,372
My days were vauge as I'm wondering What's the name?

395
00:22:38,372 --> 00:22:42,936
It took my far-reaching dream that kept me standing in awe

396
00:22:42,936 --> 00:22:48,096
along with my despair and consume them all away

397
00:22:48,096 --> 00:22:52,551
My voice has been engraved by the shape of my wish

398
00:22:52,551 --> 00:22:57,068
Make it stronger, stronger, even stronger!

399
00:22:57,068 --> 00:23:00,222
Fly high!

400
00:23:01,923 --> 00:23:06,945
Beyond a Fiction that nobody knows,

401
00:23:06,945 --> 00:23:11,977
There's a slowly sprouting impulse of Skill to stay alive

402
00:23:11,977 --> 00:23:16,840
If what I feel right now is Reality, then it will surely be a proof someday

403
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:21,759
Each one of your story, I shall give a name to it

404
00:23:21,759 --> 00:23:27,070
to the east, to the west, to the high stand up to the period!

405
00:23:27,070 --> 00:23:29,662
Let's go!

406
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:38,820
Next time, "Meeting the Goblins."
