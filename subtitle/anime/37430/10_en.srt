1
00:00:00,447 --> 00:00:05,168
Beyond a Fiction that nobody knows,

2
00:00:05,168 --> 00:00:10,523
here I open a nameless Story!

3
00:00:23,394 --> 00:00:28,030
The sky above holds a tomorrow brimming with hope

4
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:33,355
My days were vauge as I'm wondering What's the name?

5
00:00:33,355 --> 00:00:37,919
It took my far-reaching dream that kept me standing in awe

6
00:00:37,919 --> 00:00:43,079
along with my despair and consume them all away

7
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:47,534
My voice has been engraved by the shape of my wish

8
00:00:47,534 --> 00:00:52,051
Make it stronger, stronger, even stronger!

9
00:00:52,051 --> 00:00:55,205
Fly high!

10
00:00:56,906 --> 00:01:01,928
Beyond a Fiction that nobody knows,

11
00:01:01,928 --> 00:01:06,960
There's a slowly sprouting impulse of Skill to stay alive

12
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:11,823
If what I feel right now is Reality, then it will surely be a proof someday

13
00:01:11,823 --> 00:01:16,742
Each one of your story, I shall give a name to it

14
00:01:16,742 --> 00:01:22,053
to the east, to the west, to the high stand up to the period!

15
00:01:22,053 --> 00:01:24,645
Let's go!

16
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:52,820
G-Great Rimuru?

17
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:54,670
Is it not to your tastes?

18
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,400
That's so good!

19
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:08,040
This is bliss!

20
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:12,510
I didn't have a sense of taste in my slime form.

21
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:16,530
This is the first time I've tasted food since I came to this world.

22
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:20,430
It's so great to be alive!

23
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:36,830
The Orcs attacked the Ogres?

24
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:38,380
That can't be!

25
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,670
It's the truth.

26
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:43,600
Can such a thing really happen?

27
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,240
I don't know.

28
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,610
Is it that strange?

29
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:48,700
Gobta...

30
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:50,250
Of course it is.

31
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:53,480
Ogres are immeasurably stronger than Orcs.

32
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:56,900
That such a weak race would attack them is unthinkable.

33
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:00,280
Nevertheless, they did come.

34
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:06,820
They attacked our village out of nowhere.

35
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:10,410
They carried weapons and wore armor,

36
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:14,280
and their overwhelming numbers filled the entire forest.

37
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:18,220
Those detestable pigs...

38
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:21,180
overran our village.

39
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,590
Orcs wearing armor?

40
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:28,430
Yes, the same type of full plate mail that Humans wear.

41
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:32,270
That must mean...

42
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:36,030
It's likely the Orcs are not working alone.

43
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:40,070
Orcs could never round up all that valuable armor themselves.

44
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:43,230
Exactly.

45
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:44,990
Among them was...

46
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:51,210
A masked majin?

47
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:56,170
It was a high-level majin.

48
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:57,610
I'm certain of it.

49
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:03,720
And you fought Great Rimuru because you had mistaken him for this masked majin.

50
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:04,640
Yes.

51
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:08,460
So... what does all this mean?

52
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:14,380
That the Orcs have sided with one of the Demon Lords, possibly?

53
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:16,730
I see... I guess?

54
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:19,480
A Demon Lord, eh?

55
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:22,610
But why a Demon Lord?

56
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:24,540
I don't know.

57
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:29,660
The only thing I'm sure of is that

58
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:33,400
only six of my three hundred brethren remain alive.

59
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:35,360
I see.

60
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,360
No wonder you're upset.

61
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:41,440
Have you had enough meat, Rimuru?

62
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,540
I'm taking a break.

63
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:45,730
Your little sister's really something.

64
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:51,350
She knows a lot about medicinal and cooking herbs.

65
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:53,980
The Goblins took to her immediately.

66
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:56,420
She was a sheltered child.

67
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:58,540
She must be happy that they're relying on her.

68
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:02,750
So, what are you guys going to do now?

69
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:04,490
What do you mean?

70
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:06,710
I mean your plans for the future.

71
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:11,500
Whether you rebuild your village or relocate to another area,

72
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:15,020
the fate of your comrades is depending on your leadership, right?

73
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:18,460
That's easy.

74
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:21,370
We will build our strength and take them on again.

75
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:22,920
Do you know where to find them?

76
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,670
He doesn't have a plan at all.

77
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,060
Well, I have a suggestion.

78
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:36,920
Do you guys have any interest in being my subordinates?

79
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:38,920
Subordinates?

80
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:41,400
Of course, all I can pay you

81
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:45,490
is guaranteed food, shelter, and clothing.

82
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:48,090
You need a home base, right?

83
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:53,210
But that would involve your whole village in our revenge.

84
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:57,960
Well... I'm not just offering this as a favor to you guys.

85
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:02,920
You said thousands of armed Orcs attacked you, right?

86
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:06,660
And there might be a Demon Lord pulling the strings.

87
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:12,930
The Orcs may be seeking dominion over the Great Forest of Jura.

88
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:18,440
This town isn't completely safe, either.

89
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:24,150
Which is why adding as many to our numbers as possible would benefit us.

90
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:29,610
Plus, if anything happened to you guys, I'd fight with you.

91
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:32,950
I'll never abandon a friend.

92
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:35,800
I see.

93
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:39,710
Let me give it some thought.

94
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:43,120
Sure. Take all the time you need to think about it.

95
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:47,850
Well, I think I'll go get some more meat.

96
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:01,970
It's not a bad offer.

97
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:06,480
But it's your choice to make.

98
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:09,740
We'll do whatever you and the princess decide.

99
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,820
If only I were stronger...

100
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:40,600
Have you decided?

101
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:43,740
The Ogres are a warring clan.

102
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:47,800
We aren't against taking to the battlefield in service to another.

103
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:51,040
If our master is strong, we are all the more pleased to serve them.

104
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:58,200
Can our contract last only until we take out the Orcs' leader?

105
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:01,080
You can do whatever you want after that.

106
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,180
You can stay and help us build a nation,

107
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:05,580
or you can go on your way.

108
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:16,850
I would like to accept the offer you presented last night.

109
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:21,100
We will hereby serve under you.

110
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,080
Good.

111
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:27,780
I should've given more consideration to how he feels.

112
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:30,340
I'm sure all he wants is to avenge his people now,

113
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:32,090
even if it gets him killed.

114
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:39,160
He's making this decision as a leader who's had to accept his own weakness.

115
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:41,790
Lift your head.

116
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:49,410
You're all accepted. Call in the others.

117
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:50,130
Yes, sir.

118
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,260
All I can do...

119
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:56,600
is make sure he won't regret that decision.

120
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,520
I'll give you names to prove you're my subordinates.

121
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,470
All of us?

122
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:13,820
Well, having no name makes things tough, doesn't it?

123
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:16,090
But...

124
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:18,230
P-Please, wait.

125
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:21,850
Giving a name comes with great risks.

126
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:23,200
And to name such superior monsters—

127
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,000
It's fine, really. Don't worry about it.

128
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,430
But...

129
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:31,360
The "risk" is me using too many magicules and falling asleep, right?

130
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,090
There's only six of them this time, so it'll be fine.

131
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:37,930
Or do you just not want me to name you?

132
00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:39,730
That isn't...

133
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:41,050
We have no complaints.

134
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:42,310
Brother!

135
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:45,010
We gratefully accept your names.

136
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:48,310
If this is the young master's will, we accept.

137
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,220
Okay, let's get started.

138
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:59,620
You are...

139
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:06,430
Shion, it's time to switch places.

140
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:10,220
Oh, no, Princess. I will look after Great Rimuru.

141
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:12,310
Please get some rest.

142
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:15,080
Really, Shion...

143
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:21,350
Great Rimuru, good morning!

144
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:24,830
Um... Who are you again?

145
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:29,450
Wait... My memory's a little fuzzy,

146
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:32,780
but I think I was about to name the Ogres when...

147
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:33,800
Huh?

148
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:36,730
Have you awakened, Great Rimuru?

149
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:40,860
You're the "young master" of the Ogres, right?

150
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:41,690
Correct.

151
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:44,250
I have evolved into a Kijin,

152
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:47,060
and I have assumed the name you gave me: Benimaru.

153
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:49,770
Oh!

154
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:54,960
I remember now! I went into sleep mode the moment I named him!

155
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:58,630
Wait, what did he say? "Kijin"? Not "Ogre"?

156
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:03,510
"Kijin" refers to a race of beings uncommonly born of Ogres.

157
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:05,850
Huh...

158
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:10,200
His body looks... a little smaller?

159
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:14,900
The amount of magicules in him has exploded, though...

160
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:20,070
Is this a repeat of the Rigurd shock?!

161
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:24,120
This means he evolved from an Ogre to a Kijin, right?

162
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:26,760
Great Rimuru, I am Shuna.

163
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:31,490
I'm so glad to see that you've awakened.

164
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:32,670
Shuna...

165
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,640
Right, she's the Ogre princess.

166
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:39,170
She was already cute, but she's even prettier now!

167
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:41,320
I am Shion.

168
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:46,010
I'm very fond of the name you gave me, Great Rimuru.

169
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,220
This busty beauty is Shion?

170
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:52,570
She looks less wild and more intelligent now.

171
00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:59,580
And the one behind Benimaru... is the old man who cut off my arm.

172
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:02,530
Such a mean-spirited remark.

173
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:06,310
It was I who felt shocked when you instantly regenerated your arm.

174
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:09,460
He looks a lot younger now.

175
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:12,750
Is that a result of his evolution to Kijin?

176
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:16,530
And I think you're...

177
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:19,080
You have given me the name "Souei."

178
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:24,380
I am glad to see that you have recovered, Great Rimuru.

179
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:26,180
Th-Thanks.

180
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:29,100
Giving a name to a superior monster

181
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:31,520
consumes an equally large amount of magicules.

182
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:37,720
In other words, naming just six of them drained almost all my magicules?

183
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,850
I wish you'd told me that sooner.

184
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:43,720
Where's the sixth one?

185
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:47,280
Oh, he's been spending a lot of time at Kaijin's workshop.

186
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,710
I heard Great Rimuru has awakened!

187
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:51,830
Ah, there he is.

188
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:54,140
I think he looked like this.

189
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:56,560
I wonder how he changed...

190
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,130
Great Rimuru!

191
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:01,040
I'm so glad you're well!

192
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:04,560
You recognize me, right? I am Kurobe.

193
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,550
He looks like an ordinary middle-aged guy!

194
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:07,880
So after a hot guy,

195
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,200
a cute girl,

196
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,100
a babe,

197
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:11,860
a dignified gray,

198
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:13,250
and another hot guy...

199
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:15,850
He's just a middle-aged guy! What a relief!

200
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:18,110
I hope we'll be good friends, Kurobe!

201
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:19,360
Sure!

202
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:26,360
Meanwhile...

203
00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:30,200
The changes occurring in the Great Forest of Jura

204
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,620
continued their invasive progress.

205
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:48,660
In the middle of the Great Forest of Jura is Lake Siss.

206
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:53,600
Vast marshlands surround the lake.

207
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:57,380
The Lizardmen control this territory.

208
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:00,480
R-Reporting!

209
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:03,480
We have spotted an Orc army south of Lake Siss!

210
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:06,990
We believe they intend to invade our territory!

211
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,680
Orcs?

212
00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:11,090
Prepare for battle.

213
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:13,440
We'll beat those pigs senseless.

214
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,250
How many are there?

215
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:16,690
Well...

216
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:19,750
The Orc army numbers...

217
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:22,100
approximately 200,000.

218
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:26,880
I-Impossible! How can they have twice what we have?!

219
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,340
We verified the number several times with Magic Sense and Sense Heat Source.

220
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:34,140
I swear on my life that it is true.

221
00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:36,710
Good work.

222
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:39,040
You may rest.

223
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,029
Yes, sir.

224
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:44,580
200,000?

225
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:51,450
How does one keep such a ridiculous number of Orc bellies full?

226
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:55,660
They're supposed to be an uncoordinated lot that does whatever they please.

227
00:14:55,660 --> 00:15:00,360
No one could lead an outrageous number like 200,000 of them!

228
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:04,600
I heard a rumor that they destroyed the Ogre village.

229
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,710
They did what?!

230
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:08,800
The Orc Lord...

231
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:14,800
If there is an Orc who could command a force of 200,000 of his brethren,

232
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:21,140
it would have to be the unique monster of legend, the Orc Lord.

233
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,120
O-Orc Lord?

234
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,650
But that's...

235
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,290
No, if that really is true,

236
00:15:29,290 --> 00:15:34,410
it would explain how he's able to command such a huge army of Orcs.

237
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:36,520
But what would he want?

238
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,660
That doesn't matter!

239
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:41,300
The question is whether or not we can defeat them!

240
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:46,810
If an Orc Lord truly has been born,

241
00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:48,590
it will be difficult for us to win.

242
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:57,600
The Orc Lord is a true monster that devours even the fear and terror of his own allies.

243
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:01,100
It is only a possibility,

244
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:04,920
but we must do everything we can possibly do.

245
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,700
And what does that entail?

246
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:09,480
I suppose we should request backup.

247
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:11,950
My son!

248
00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:14,330
Is my son here?

249
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:17,140
I'm right here.

250
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:26,050
But, Father, must you address me in such a boorish manner?

251
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:31,590
I have a name, Gabiru, which was given to me by Lord Gelmud.

252
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:35,150
What you are called makes no difference.

253
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:41,730
There is something I need you to do.

254
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:45,730
What would that be?

255
00:16:51,330 --> 00:16:53,070
You'll have to do better than that!

256
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:01,410
Well, come on! Strike back!

257
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:08,510
Gobta casually said he wanted to learn swordsmanship, and this happened.

258
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:11,630
Hakurou is definitely a tough coach.

259
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:16,300
Orc Lord? What's that?

260
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:20,520
Well, put simply... it's a beast.

261
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,180
That's simple, all right.

262
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:26,390
It's said that one is born to the Orcs every few centuries.

263
00:17:27,090 --> 00:17:28,680
It's a unique monster.

264
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,140
Unique, huh?

265
00:17:30,930 --> 00:17:34,540
They say he devours even his own allies' fear and terror,

266
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:37,800
which makes him an unnaturally effective leader.

267
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,160
Yikes.

268
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:44,230
The Orcs that attacked our village were unfazed by the deaths of their own,

269
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,330
so I thought that may be the case.

270
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:47,670
I see.

271
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:52,300
Of course, the possibility of it is quite low.

272
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:58,180
Any other ideas why they might have attacked your village?

273
00:17:58,520 --> 00:17:59,800
Well...

274
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:02,560
I'm not sure if there's any connection,

275
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:07,060
but shortly before the attack, a majin visited our village...

276
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:10,310
I shall name you.

277
00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:14,320
He said that, but he sounded too untrustworthy,

278
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:18,200
so I turned him away, and he cursed me as he left.

279
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:20,410
A majin, huh?

280
00:18:20,410 --> 00:18:23,830
So you think he might have a grudge against you?

281
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:25,300
I had no other choice.

282
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:28,710
I want no such gift from an unsuitable master.

283
00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:33,720
I wouldn't accept a name from just anyone, after all.

284
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,880
What was his name again?

285
00:18:39,050 --> 00:18:40,080
I think he said...

286
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:43,890
Gela... Geli... Gele... Gelo?

287
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,390
Gelmud.

288
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:51,020
Right, that's it.

289
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:55,680
Gelmud? I think I've heard that name before...

290
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:01,280
Rigur-kun, who gave your brother his name?

291
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:06,330
Sir! I'm told he received his name from a passing Demon called Lord Gelmud.

292
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:08,110
He saw promise in him.

293
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:09,410
Gel...?

294
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:12,500
Gelmud. He's an officer in the Demon Lord's army.

295
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:14,910
I bet it's the same guy.

296
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:17,600
Does he just go around naming whoever?

297
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,760
Why?

298
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:21,320
I bring a report, Great Rimuru.

299
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:22,497
Okay.

300
00:19:22,497 --> 00:19:24,840
I witnessed a group of Lizardmen.

301
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:27,680
Lizardmen? Not Orcs?

302
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:28,676
Correct.

303
00:19:28,676 --> 00:19:30,940
Because they make the marshlands their home,

304
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:33,760
it seemed unnatural to see them near here,

305
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,700
so I had to inform you at once.

306
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:41,780
They seemed to be attempting negotiations with a nearby Goblin village.

307
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:44,780
They may one day come here, as well.

308
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,270
I see...

309
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:48,430
Lizardmen...

310
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:08,850
Honestly, that father of mine...

311
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:12,850
Visit the local Goblin villages and enlist their aid.

312
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,450
Indeed!

313
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:19,980
It is not the way of the proud Lizardman race to fear mere Orcs!

314
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:24,740
And he used to be such a great man...

315
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:28,260
Hey, Sir Gabiru, when are you gonna become the chieftain?

316
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:35,110
Oh, no. My comment may have been a bit disrespectful,

317
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:38,250
but I still fall far short of my father.

318
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:39,720
Really?

319
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:43,780
But as you are now, I bet you're just as mighty as the chieftain during his glory days!

320
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:44,590
I agree.

321
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:46,590
No, really, I...

322
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:49,310
I mean, you're named, after all!

323
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:53,040
Yes, and you are unequaled in the art of the spear.

324
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:55,830
If you don't take your stand now, when will you?

325
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:03,430
Eh? What is this?

326
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:09,590
Could it be... that I'm actually pretty great?!

327
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:11,740
You are right.

328
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:13,810
My father has grown old.

329
00:21:13,810 --> 00:21:15,530
Even if I must be a bit forceful,

330
00:21:15,530 --> 00:21:20,270
I will show him that I have strength worthy of a chieftain!

331
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:25,140
Then he can retire with peace of mind.

332
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:26,010
You mean...

333
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:30,060
Yes!

334
00:21:34,190 --> 00:21:36,670
Once I drive away the Orc army,

335
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:40,480
I will take my place as the next Lizardman chieftain!

336
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:43,310
That's our Sir Gabiru! Woohoo!

337
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:44,190
You're on fire!

338
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:45,610
You will surely be chieftain!

339
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:50,311
Gabiru! Gabiru! Gabiru!

340
00:21:50,311 --> 00:21:51,800
Let's go!

341
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:57,540
Follow me, men! Your future is bright!

342
00:21:59,290 --> 00:22:02,800
Gabiru! Gabiru! Gabiru!

343
00:22:17,124 --> 00:22:22,904
Why is it only those who have hope

344
00:22:22,904 --> 00:22:28,401
To fall into despair from the bottom of their heart?

345
00:22:28,401 --> 00:22:33,325
Why is it only those who have courage

346
00:22:33,325 --> 00:22:39,267
To be wounded at the end of their honor?

347
00:22:39,267 --> 00:22:44,984
I don't want to close my eyes in face of sadness

348
00:22:44,984 --> 00:22:50,613
The dawn for new tomorrow was a mere dream to me

349
00:22:50,613 --> 00:22:56,385
Then I see a light falling through the crack of the night

350
00:22:56,385 --> 00:23:02,836
The sky is crying

351
00:23:03,341 --> 00:23:08,905
I don't know what is there at the corner of the world

352
00:23:08,905 --> 00:23:14,521
All I want is to protect those within my reach

353
00:23:14,521 --> 00:23:20,740
Staring at the only reason to fight

354
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:27,926
We who believe the answer to be forgiveness...

355
00:23:27,926 --> 00:23:32,680
Must not lose!

356
00:23:35,810 --> 00:23:38,490
Next time, "Gabiru Is Here!"
