1
00:00:00,447 --> 00:00:05,168
Beyond a Fiction that nobody knows,

2
00:00:05,168 --> 00:00:10,523
here I open a nameless Story!

3
00:00:23,394 --> 00:00:28,030
The sky above holds a tomorrow brimming with hope

4
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:33,355
My days were vauge as I'm wondering What's the name?

5
00:00:33,355 --> 00:00:37,919
It took my far-reaching dream that kept me standing in awe

6
00:00:37,919 --> 00:00:43,079
along with my despair and consume them all away

7
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:47,534
My voice has been engraved by the shape of my wish

8
00:00:47,534 --> 00:00:52,051
Make it stronger, stronger, even stronger!

9
00:00:52,051 --> 00:00:55,205
Fly high!

10
00:00:56,906 --> 00:01:01,928
Beyond a Fiction that nobody knows,

11
00:01:01,928 --> 00:01:06,960
There's a slowly sprouting impulse of Skill to stay alive

12
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:11,823
If what I feel right now is Reality, then it will surely be a proof someday

13
00:01:11,823 --> 00:01:16,742
Each one of your story, I shall give a name to it

14
00:01:16,742 --> 00:01:22,053
to the east, to the west, to the high stand up to the period!

15
00:01:22,053 --> 00:01:24,645
Let's go!

16
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:48,910
We're on our way to the marshlands to sign a treaty

17
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:51,500
with the Lizardman chieftain and fight the Orc army.

18
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:53,380
The ones accompanying me are

19
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:56,380
Benimaru, Shion, Hakurou,

20
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:58,600
and Souei, who's out scouting.

21
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,390
There's also Ranga...

22
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:02,760
and our Goblin riders.

23
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:07,520
Oh, and we've left Rigurd and the rest to watch the village.

24
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,520
The plan is that they'll flee immediately if we lose.

25
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,340
Great Rimuru, a moment?

26
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:17,190
What's up, Souei?

27
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:20,100
I've come across two groups currently engaged in battle.

28
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:25,040
One of them is a personal guard to the Lizardman chieftain.

29
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:28,010
They appear to be fighting a high-ranking Orc.

30
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:30,170
What action shall I take?

31
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:31,900
Well, I mean...

32
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:34,460
We have to help them, don't we?

33
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:35,850
Can you win?

34
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:37,150
A simple task.

35
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,310
He didn't even hesitate!

36
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:41,970
So being a hottie makes him skilled, too?

37
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:44,680
Do it. We'll be there soon.

38
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,540
Understood.

39
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:49,620
Assume battle formation. We're going to meet Souei!

40
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:50,280
Sir!

41
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,400
Let's do this!

42
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:52,690
Ranga!

43
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:54,340
As you command!

44
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:07,700
Er, what? It's already over?

45
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:10,480
He should've left some for us...

46
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:16,580
Oh, boy. That Souei really is skilled.

47
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:19,550
She is gravely injured.

48
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:23,110
Okay.

49
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,980
Don't worry. It's healing potion.

50
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:43,680
M-My wound... I thought it was fatal.

51
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:45,950
Wh-Who are you?

52
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:48,450
I'm Rimuru Tempest.

53
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:53,500
I must ask a favor of you!

54
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:59,000
Please save my father, the Lizardman chieftain, and my brother Gabiru!

55
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:02,880
You're Gabiru's sister?

56
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:03,980
I am.

57
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,630
What happened?

58
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:10,140
My brother led a rebellion and imprisoned the chieftain.

59
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:15,430
I believe he intends to repel the Orc army on his own,

60
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:18,810
but he has underestimated the Orc Lord.

61
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:21,820
If we take no action, the Lizardmen will surely be exterminated.

62
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:25,700
My father helped me escape during a lapse in the guard's attention.

63
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:28,830
I am aware that this is a selfish request,

64
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:31,860
after we broke our promise to wait for you,

65
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:37,800
but I implore mercy from you who serve such a powerful majin!

66
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,310
Please... Please!

67
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,090
Well said, indeed!

68
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:46,690
That you recognize our leader Rimuru's greatness

69
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:49,500
means you have potential!

70
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:52,940
H-Hey, Shion...

71
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:54,820
Come now, stand up.

72
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:58,890
I'm certain the Lizardmen can be saved, just as you hoped!

73
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:00,300
Whoa, whoa...

74
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:03,630
Thank you! Thank you!

75
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:06,170
The way she just accepts work for me on her own...

76
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:07,870
She's definitely a secretary.

77
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:12,090
What choice do we have? We'll be fighting the Orc Lord, either way.

78
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:16,190
So, um... You're the chieftain's daughter, you say?

79
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:17,330
Y-Yes, sir!

80
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:20,710
I am at your command.

81
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:23,710
Then I'll acknowledge you as a representative of the chieftain.

82
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:27,090
Do you object to forging an alliance right here and now?

83
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:29,850
No, not at all!

84
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:33,100
Then it's settled. The alliance is complete.

85
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:35,990
Thank you so much.

86
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:41,360
Souei, can you use Shadow Movement to get to the chieftain from here?

87
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:42,860
Of course.

88
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:44,860
I so envy your skills...

89
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:47,610
I'm ordering the rescue of the Lizardman chieftain.

90
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:48,420
Understood.

91
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:52,870
You have my gratitude.

92
00:05:57,030 --> 00:05:59,250
The rest of us will continue our march!

93
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:00,120
Sir!

94
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:20,400
Trample all! Trample all! Trample all!

95
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:24,330
Mere Orcs are no match for us Lizardmen!

96
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:26,650
Right! Withdraw for now!

97
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,900
Our plan was to toy with them

98
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:32,120
and have the Goblins finish them off,

99
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:35,590
but it looks like we won't even need the Goblins' help.

100
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:39,360
What's happening?

101
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:43,420
The Orcs... are eating other Orcs?

102
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:53,260
H-Help!

103
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:55,660
S-Sir G-Gabiru—

104
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,770
Retreat! Now!

105
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:03,510
Retreat!

106
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:07,140
Sir Gabiru, we're already surrounded!

107
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:08,070
What?!

108
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:13,110
What just happened?

109
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:16,310
They're clearly moving faster now!

110
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:26,670
Impossible! Webbed feet and scales on an Orc?!

111
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:29,670
That makes them just like us!

112
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:32,410
They just ate one of our men!

113
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:35,470
Indeed! It was then that their movements changed!

114
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:40,100
Are they gaining our powers by eating us?!

115
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:52,050
The entire horde...

116
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:53,530
Maintain close formation!

117
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:59,450
Keep the Goblins in the center! Leave no space between you!

118
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:03,080
Shield the Goblins while breaking through the Orcs' formation!

119
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,590
If it was just us, perhaps we could have escaped,

120
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:12,570
but bringing the Goblins worked against us in the end!

121
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:15,770
Trample all! Trample all!

122
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:18,600
Our allies' powers will become our own!

123
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:21,600
The enemy's powers will become our own!

124
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:23,060
Do not fear!

125
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:26,950
Show them the strength upon which we Lizardmen pride ourselves!

126
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:28,610
Yeah!

127
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:41,560
Wh-What an intimidating aura...

128
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,590
You, Orc!

129
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,510
You are the Orc Lord, correct?

130
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:56,760
I am Gabiru, chieftain of the Lizardmen!

131
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,791
Face me one-on-one to settle this—

132
00:08:58,791 --> 00:09:01,000
I am not the Lord.

133
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:05,840
I am an Orc General.

134
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:08,900
I am far inferior to the great Orc Lord.

135
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:11,650
You're not the Orc Lord?

136
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:16,350
Even with this much power, he's still far inferior?

137
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:20,020
You wish to fight one-on-one?

138
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:22,370
Interesting.

139
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:24,590
I accept.

140
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:28,380
I thank you!

141
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:34,080
Just what kind of monster is the real Orc Lord, then?!

142
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:39,890
Yes! Yes!

143
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:44,020
This is going great! Right, Lord Gelmud?

144
00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:45,300
Indeed.

145
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:49,000
Looks like everything's going according to plan!

146
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:53,610
It won't be long before my child gains dominion over the forest.

147
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:55,690
And then my ambition will—

148
00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:58,620
You seem to be having quite a fun time.

149
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:00,380
Who's there?!

150
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:02,890
My name is Treyni.

151
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:06,540
I cannot overlook malicious scheming in this forest.

152
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:09,170
This isn't good, Lord Gelmud!

153
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:11,230
That's a Dryad! They're the caretakers of the forest!

154
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:12,580
What?!

155
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:17,170
For the disruption you've caused, I am removing you from this forest.

156
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:18,800
Huh?!

157
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:22,650
Spirit summoning: Sylphide!

158
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:26,850
Wait, wait, wait, wait! You're jumpin' the gun a bit here!

159
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:28,600
The time for judgment has come.

160
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,690
Pray in repentance for your sins.

161
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,030
Aerial Blade!

162
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:44,270
H-Hey! Your arm!

163
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:46,910
You're crazy, lady.

164
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:49,050
We don't even get a say in this?

165
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:51,920
Well, we've already achieved our goal, anyway...

166
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,600
so we'll just be gettin' out of here.

167
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:56,800
So long, now!

168
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:03,220
They escaped...

169
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:07,290
This is not a desirable outcome.

170
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:12,860
Rimuru Tempest, I am trusting you to defeat the Orc Lord.

171
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:34,580
Vortex Crash!

172
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:47,010
Chaos Eater!

173
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:02,570
You're trying to eat me?

174
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:07,280
Do you think you can keep running forever?

175
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:10,820
S-Sir Gabiru!

176
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:11,790
We will help!

177
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:13,160
Stay out of this!

178
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:15,630
I'll handle this one-on-one!

179
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,360
You're such a man, Gabiru!

180
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,760
Gabiru!

181
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:21,880
Gabiru!

182
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:31,480
Gabiru! Gabiru! Gabiru!

183
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:42,060
This is nothing!

184
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:50,840
What?

185
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,490
Sir Gabiru!

186
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:15,770
Lizards are best suited to crawling on the ground.

187
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:17,900
Now die!

188
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:30,160
Y-You're... the true leader of that village!

189
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:33,820
What's this guy talking about?

190
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:36,410
Have you come to save us?!

191
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:40,000
That's Gobta, captain of the Goblin riders.

192
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:43,490
The Direwolf!

193
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:45,080
My name is Ranga.

194
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:48,050
I've come to help you on my master Rimuru's orders.

195
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:50,480
How did you get here?

196
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:53,560
Shadow Movement. Are you incapable of learning?

197
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,610
Rimuru, you say?

198
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,830
I don't know who any of you are,

199
00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:04,330
but if you will stand in my way, I will show no—

200
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:17,350
Oh, looks like it's started.

201
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:22,010
The great magic of the Lizardmen?

202
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:24,340
I must end this quickly

203
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:28,590
and end whoever is using great magic!

204
00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:38,400
So, um... Gabiru, was it?

205
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,980
We should assume a defensive formation.

206
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:44,060
I understand, but...

207
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:47,680
What are those flames?

208
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,640
No need to worry. They're on our side...

209
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:53,580
I think.

210
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:00,200
This is why I told you to move.

211
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,170
Wh-Who are you?!

212
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:06,870
You don't remember us? That's harsh.

213
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:09,760
You devoured our village, remember?

214
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:16,010
Those horns... Are you Ogres?!

215
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,020
Are we, now?

216
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:20,830
That might not be quite true anymore.

217
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:22,410
It is time.

218
00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:26,520
We must thank Great Rimuru for giving us this opportunity.

219
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:28,230
I'll say it once more.

220
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:30,880
Move out of the way, pigs...

221
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:34,320
unless you want to be wiped out without a trace.

222
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:49,180
Wow...

223
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:54,440
It appears you've come to assist the lizards,

224
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,800
but you waste your time.

225
00:15:56,700 --> 00:16:02,420
Goblins and dogs, the arrival of worthless monsters such as yourselves

226
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:05,810
will not sway our superiority in the least!

227
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,440
Worthless?!

228
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,820
We will show you, then.

229
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,840
H-Huh?!

230
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:39,670
What is this?

231
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:45,020
Answer. This is the individual Ranga's wide-range attack, Death Storm.

232
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:46,310
Oh... I see.

233
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:52,320
Curse you!

234
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:14,740
He turned into a Tempest Star Wolf!

235
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:17,600
Do you see now, Orcs?!

236
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:22,480
This is a mere fraction of the power of the one you mocked as being worthless!

237
00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:25,150
It blew everything away...

238
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:26,150
Yes!

239
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,610
This is our brand new beginning.

240
00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:46,120
Of Great Rimuru's many glorious victories in war...

241
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:50,750
This will be the first, you see!

242
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:56,260
Don't get cocky!

243
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,370
Great Rimuru!

244
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:15,320
Y-Yeah...

245
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:18,570
I hope I never piss her off.

246
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:21,700
But anyway...

247
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:25,710
That overwhelming Orc army is shrinking before my eyes.

248
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:28,440
I guess those Kijin really are a major asset.

249
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:34,090
Man, I hope they'll still want to be friends after this war's over.

250
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:37,970
I wonder how things are going for Souei...

251
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:48,110
We're... alive?

252
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:51,760
Use this.

253
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:03,660
Father!

254
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:09,770
You truly came for us, Souei!

255
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:16,000
But why?

256
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,050
The alliance was formed.

257
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:20,460
And how did...

258
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:23,890
I was acknowledged as your representative.

259
00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:25,390
Reinforcements are coming.

260
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:26,810
Truly?

261
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:30,600
It is not yet time to give up, Father!

262
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:33,670
Our people will be saved?

263
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:39,970
Souei!

264
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:41,350
No need to worry.

265
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:45,380
I've already rendered him immobile.

266
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:53,500
One can't help but react that way, it seems...

267
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,390
My... My decision...

268
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:59,400
My decision to accept this alliance...

269
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:01,360
was the correct choice!

270
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:08,460
You can see this, can't you, puppet master of the Orcs?

271
00:20:09,010 --> 00:20:10,770
You will be next.

272
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,100
Destroying the Ogres' village

273
00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:15,610
and making enemies of the Kijin

274
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:17,570
will be your greatest regrets.

275
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:37,500
Damn them all!

276
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,090
Useless fools!

277
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:40,990
Kijin, he said?

278
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:44,010
I did have Geld attack a large Ogre village...

279
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:47,690
Does this mean the survivors of that village evolved?!

280
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:50,280
And that huge animal!

281
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:53,770
No one told me there was a beast like that in the Forest of Jura!

282
00:20:54,290 --> 00:20:58,770
What in the world is happening outside my notice?!

283
00:20:58,770 --> 00:21:01,390
This is bad! I must do something...

284
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:03,900
or my plans will fall apart after coming so far!

285
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,090
If this goes on, I'll be...

286
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:13,180
I'll be killed... by him!

287
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:43,400
I found the Orc Lord!

288
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,210
Right!

289
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:49,450
I'm hungry...

290
00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:53,980
I want to eat something... anything!

291
00:21:59,330 --> 00:22:00,800
Orc Lord...

292
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,060
I'm going to put an end to you.

293
00:22:17,084 --> 00:22:22,864
Why is it only those who have hope

294
00:22:22,864 --> 00:22:28,361
To fall into despair from the bottom of their heart?

295
00:22:28,361 --> 00:22:33,285
Why is it only those who have courage

296
00:22:33,285 --> 00:22:39,227
To be wounded at the end of their honor?

297
00:22:39,227 --> 00:22:44,944
I don't want to close my eyes in face of sadness

298
00:22:44,944 --> 00:22:50,573
The dawn for new tomorrow was a mere dream to me

299
00:22:50,573 --> 00:22:56,345
Then I see a light falling through the crack of the night

300
00:22:56,345 --> 00:23:02,796
The sky is crying

301
00:23:03,301 --> 00:23:08,865
I don't know what is there at the corner of the world

302
00:23:08,865 --> 00:23:14,481
All I want is to protect those within my reach

303
00:23:14,481 --> 00:23:20,700
Staring at the only reason to fight

304
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:27,886
We who believe the answer to be forgiveness...

305
00:23:27,886 --> 00:23:32,640
Must not lose!

306
00:23:35,930 --> 00:23:38,800
Next time, "The One Who Devours All."
