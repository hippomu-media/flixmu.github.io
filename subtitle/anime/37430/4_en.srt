1
00:00:00,447 --> 00:00:05,168
Beyond a Fiction that nobody knows,

2
00:00:05,168 --> 00:00:10,523
here I open a nameless Story!

3
00:00:23,394 --> 00:00:28,030
The sky above holds a tomorrow brimming with hope

4
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:33,355
My days were vauge as I'm wondering What's the name?

5
00:00:33,355 --> 00:00:37,919
It took my far-reaching dream that kept me standing in awe

6
00:00:37,919 --> 00:00:43,079
along with my despair and consume them all away

7
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:47,534
My voice has been engraved by the shape of my wish

8
00:00:47,534 --> 00:00:52,051
Make it stronger, stronger, even stronger!

9
00:00:52,051 --> 00:00:55,205
Fly high!

10
00:00:56,906 --> 00:01:01,928
Beyond a Fiction that nobody knows,

11
00:01:01,928 --> 00:01:06,960
There's a slowly sprouting impulse of Skill to stay alive

12
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:11,823
If what I feel right now is Reality, then it will surely be a proof someday

13
00:01:11,823 --> 00:01:16,742
Each one of your story, I shall give a name to it

14
00:01:16,742 --> 00:01:22,053
to the east, to the west, to the high stand up to the period!

15
00:01:22,053 --> 00:01:24,645
Let's go!

16
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:43,460
Rimuru and his friends follow the Ameld River north

17
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,830
in search of artisans who can make clothing and houses for the Goblins.

18
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:50,670
They're heading to Dwargon, the Kingdom of the Dwarves.

19
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:53,920
He's accompanied by Rigur and two other Goblins,

20
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:58,430
and Gobta, who says he's been to Dwargon before, is their guide.

21
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:04,400
The Tempest Wolves that evolved from the Direwolves

22
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:07,620
run as fast as the wind.

23
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:11,190
Hey, no need to push yourself too hard.

24
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,190
Yes, Master!

25
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:17,250
Why are you going even faster?!

26
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:28,600
Rigur-kun, who gave your brother his name?

27
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:33,420
Sir! I'm told he received his name from a passing Demon called Lord Gelmud.

28
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:35,110
He saw promise in him.

29
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:36,760
Gel...?

30
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:39,840
Gelmud. He's an officer in the Demon Lord's army.

31
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:41,440
Oh...

32
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,090
Wait, Demon Lord's army?!

33
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:44,310
There's a Demon Lord?

34
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:48,140
Veldora said there was a hero, too...

35
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:52,450
I hope I never end up meeting them. Sounds like nothing but trouble.

36
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:06,100
Hey, Ranga...

37
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:07,633
Master?

38
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:11,470
I killed your father, which means you should want revenge, right?

39
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:13,630
Don't you think about that at all?

40
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:16,460
I've been wondering about that all along...

41
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:20,850
I do think about it.

42
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:27,500
But, Master, you not only spared us after defeating us in battle,

43
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,480
you also gave us a new name.

44
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:34,520
I have only gratitude toward you, and no resentment at all.

45
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:41,490
Our loyalty belongs to you and you alone, Master.

46
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:48,990
-Gobta. -Yes, sir?

47
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:52,410
What is the town we're heading for like?

48
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:54,380
W-Well...

49
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:57,960
It's officially called the "Armed Nation of Dwargon."

50
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:01,290
It's a beautiful city constructed from a modified natural cave system,

51
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:05,190
and it's home to not only dwarves, but elves, humans, and lots more.

52
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:06,200
Elves?!

53
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,820
Elves, huh?

54
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:14,270
The dwarf king, Gazel Dwargo, is known as the Hero King.

55
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:17,060
He's deeply admired by all the people.

56
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:18,520
Elves...

57
00:04:18,770 --> 00:04:20,140
Elves...

58
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:21,310
Great Rimuru?

59
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:26,370
I-Is it okay for monsters like me to enter Dwargon?

60
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:28,170
No need to worry.

61
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:31,140
Dwargon is a neutral free-trade city.

62
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:34,830
All fighting is prohibited by the king.

63
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:35,760
I see...

64
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:41,600
And that's made possible by the Armed Nation of Dwargon's immense military might.

65
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:45,660
It's said that the dwarven army has been undefeated for a thousand years.

66
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:46,990
A thousand years?

67
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:48,490
That is impressive!

68
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:54,760
No one would be dumb enough to get on that king's bad side.

69
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:58,133
Last time I went there, they picked a fight with me outside the gate...

70
00:04:58,133 --> 00:05:00,820
There won't be any trouble!

71
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:02,820
Hm?

72
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:07,670
I'm pretty sure a huge flag just went up... Was it just me?

73
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:09,000
Look, Great Rimuru!

74
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,830
They've cooked up nicely!

75
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:17,620
It's said that it can take a Goblin two months or more to walk to the Dwarven Kingdom.

76
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:24,340
With the help of Ranga and his packmates,

77
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:27,010
Rimuru's party traversed the same distance in just three days.

78
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:32,140
So that's where the Elves...

79
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:34,680
I mean, the Dwarves are, huh?

80
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:37,050
I hope some beautiful Elves...

81
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:40,940
I mean, some skilled Dwarves are waiting there for us.

82
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:45,280
Are you sure you want to go in with just Gobta, Great Rimuru?

83
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:46,690
Yeah.

84
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:49,630
We don't want to draw too much attention by going in a big group.

85
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:51,700
I'll take Gobta along to show me the way.

86
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:52,840
But...

87
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,280
We'll be fine!

88
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,000
Master...

89
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:58,000
Don't worry.

90
00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:01,670
We'll be back soon, so wait for us here.

91
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:04,640
Please be careful.

92
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:14,520
This is quite a line.

93
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:16,650
They must be strict about checking everyone.

94
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:19,940
Once we're inside, we can move around as we please, though.

95
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:22,190
As we please, huh?

96
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:27,650
Hey! Hey, hey, hey!

97
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:31,530
What's a couple of monsters doing here?

98
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:35,100
We're not inside yet, so we can still kill it, right?

99
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:37,040
And there it is! We're already in trouble!

100
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,460
Flag collected!

101
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:42,000
Hey, Gobta-kun, did you hear something?

102
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,100
Yes, I did...

103
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:46,960
I was beat up here last time I tried to get in, too.

104
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:50,570
It's the fate of us weak monsters.

105
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:52,470
Fate, huh?

106
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:55,990
Hey, weakling monster! Don't you ignore us!

107
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:58,970
Wait, isn't a talking slime pretty rare?

108
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:00,980
I bet we could make a fortune off of it!

109
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:02,530
Gobta-kun.

110
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:04,650
Do you remember our first rule?

111
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:06,150
Of course, sir!

112
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:08,520
Rule one: no attacking humans!

113
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:11,690
All right, now, close your eyes and cover your ears.

114
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:12,320
Huh?

115
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,240
Don't look this way, whatever you do.

116
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:15,790
Got it!

117
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:18,080
Now, then...

118
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:22,560
Hey, there.

119
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,370
I'm a generous sort, so I'll spare you if you leave now.

120
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:26,630
Get out of here.

121
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:33,480
You're just a puny, little weakling monster! Don't you mess with us!

122
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,890
You're dead now!

123
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:39,400
I was gonna let you live, but you've pissed us off!

124
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,100
Ah, that's something a weakling would say.

125
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:43,880
A puny, little weakling monster?

126
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,300
Are you referring to me?

127
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:47,070
Who else would we be referring to?!

128
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:50,440
Oh! Do I look like a slime to you?

129
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:52,700
Well, I am one, but anyway...

130
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,950
How long have you had the mistaken idea that I'm a slime?

131
00:07:57,950 --> 00:08:00,950
Allow me to show you my true form!

132
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,170
Huh? Did my Mimic skill evolve?

133
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:15,100
You just changed your appearance!

134
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:17,730
Did you think you could scare us off with that?!

135
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:20,770
Just run away already, damn it.

136
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:22,230
Good grief...

137
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:23,240
All right, fine!

138
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,310
Come at me!

139
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,210
Now you die!

140
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:27,700
You guys get him, too!

141
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:29,510
There are more of them!

142
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:31,110
Take this!

143
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:32,690
Slash Attack!

144
00:08:33,170 --> 00:08:34,740
Heavy Hitting Cut!

145
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:37,530
Fireball!

146
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:39,630
Magic Wall!

147
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:45,630
I-Impossible!

148
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:47,320
My Fireball...

149
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,500
His fur is so tough...

150
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:51,270
Did you guys just do something?

151
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:54,380
Yikes! I thought they were gonna kill me!

152
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:56,220
Mimicry is amazing!

153
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:59,320
Now it's my turn.

154
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:18,563
Er...

155
00:09:18,563 --> 00:09:19,600
Crap.

156
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:22,160
Results of Menace to follow.

157
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:25,100
16 fled.

158
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,630
68 became confused.

159
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:29,420
92 fainted.

160
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:31,290
34 soiled themselves.

161
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:33,680
Thanks, but I don't need a damage report!

162
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:34,820
Hey!

163
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:37,930
You there!

164
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:40,533
Huh?

165
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:43,690
A slime?

166
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:44,810
Tee-hee!

167
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:53,654
Some guide you turned out to be.

168
00:09:53,654 --> 00:09:56,230
And you've got some nerve to be sleeping now.

169
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:57,440
Well?

170
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,700
Uh, right!

171
00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:01,060
Actually... that's all.

172
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:07,830
Well, since you're a slime and a goblin, they probably saw you as easy targets.

173
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:10,650
I was only trying to scare them off, really...

174
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:13,800
I'm very sorry for all the trouble!

175
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:17,340
Well, what you've said agrees with witness reports.

176
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:18,920
Just this once, I'll let you two—

177
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,970
Captain! We've got trouble!

178
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,910
There's an Armorsaurus in the mine!

179
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:25,600
What?! Where's the suppression force?

180
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,970
They're already en route,

181
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:29,960
but Garm and his brothers were deep in the mine gathering magic ore,

182
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,230
and they were badly hurt!

183
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:32,780
Do we have potions?

184
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:35,730
Not enough. We've allotted most of them to war preparations.

185
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:39,240
Those guys are like brothers to me!

186
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:41,950
W-We can't waste time! Start looking for potions!

187
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:42,760
Sir...

188
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:44,340
Gather all you can, whatever it takes!

189
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:45,260
Sir.

190
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:46,120
Huh?

191
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:49,920
How dare you leave your cell?!

192
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,400
Now, now, this isn't the time for that, is it?

193
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,170
Look.

194
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:55,820
You need that, don't you?

195
00:10:57,130 --> 00:10:58,110
What's that?

196
00:10:58,110 --> 00:11:02,270
Healing potion. The best around! You can drink it or apply it directly!

197
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:03,330
Huh?

198
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,270
Why not give it a try?

199
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:13,670
Captain! You're going to trust the word of a monster?

200
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:14,770
We don't have time!

201
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:18,950
Let's go!

202
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:20,300
Yes, Captain Kaido!

203
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:22,860
You'd better stay in your cell!

204
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:30,508
He was really worried about his subordinates.

205
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:33,620
He seems like a good guy.

206
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,260
A cradle!

207
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:44,180
A diamond!

208
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,880
A hand drum!

209
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:46,890
A boat!

210
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:48,600
And now...

211
00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:50,560
Tokyo Tower!

212
00:11:57,790 --> 00:12:01,100
This guy sure is a deep sleeper.

213
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:08,320
You saved them. I thank you.

214
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:11,520
I heard you gave us that potion! Thank you!

215
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,290
Don't mention it.

216
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:14,220
My arm was nearly ripped off.

217
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:16,900
Even if I'd survived, I would've lost my job.

218
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:17,770
Thank you!

219
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:18,800
You're very welcome.

220
00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:22,800
Say something!

221
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,460
Really, thanks so much!

222
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:26,060
We owe you!

223
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:31,180
Am I free?

224
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,080
Naturally.

225
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:37,860
I've never seen such remarkable potion before.

226
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:42,360
It won't be enough to thank you, but if you ever need anything, just ask me.

227
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,420
In that case...

228
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:48,780
I see.

229
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:52,750
In that case, I'll introduce you to a skilled blacksmith.

230
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:54,370
I'd appreciate that.

231
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:57,480
No need for thanks! Just leave it to me!

232
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:02,280
Welcome!

233
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:06,750
I can tell I'm in dwarven country!

234
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:10,140
It looks so much more civilized than the Goblin Village.

235
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:11,860
This way.

236
00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:15,260
Don't get lost, now.

237
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:19,440
Wow!

238
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,230
Such detailed workmanship!

239
00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:26,490
What's up with that sword? Is it actually shining?!

240
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:27,940
Is it magic?

241
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:31,550
Yeah, that right there. It's the guy who made that.

242
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:34,280
The blacksmith we're about to meet.

243
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:42,460
This is the place. I guarantee his skills are top-notch!

244
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:44,970
Hey, Bro, you here?

245
00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:46,140
Bro?

246
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,720
Hey, Kaido. Give me a sec.

247
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:52,520
Sure.

248
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:54,680
Forgive us for interrupting.

249
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,600
That's my older brother, Kaijin.

250
00:13:57,510 --> 00:14:00,610
Wow... He definitely seems like the tough-as-nails workman type.

251
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:12,220
A slime?

252
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,160
Friend of yours, boys?

253
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:17,080
Kaijin, this is the slime we told you about.

254
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:20,570
The one that saved us when we were hurt yesterday.

255
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:23,750
Oh, so this is the one!

256
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:27,880
You have my thanks.

257
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:33,880
Oh, really, it was nothing... or maybe it was?

258
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:37,270
So, what can I do for you?

259
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:41,190
I see.

260
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:43,040
I get what you're saying.

261
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:46,450
But I'm sorry... I'm pretty backed up at the moment.

262
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:50,670
Thanks to the impossible order a certain numskull minister put in...

263
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:52,320
Impossible order?

264
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:56,600
We might be going to war soon, so he asked for twenty longswords...

265
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:59,050
by the end of the week, no less.

266
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:02,330
I'm short on materials, so I've only made one so far.

267
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:06,790
Then, couldn't you have told him it wasn't possible and refused?

268
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:07,590
Good point.

269
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:09,550
Don't be dumb!

270
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:12,660
I did tell him that, at first!

271
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:16,020
But then that damned Minister Vesta said...

272
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:17,310
My, my!

273
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:21,620
The great Kaijin that everyone calls the best blacksmith around

274
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:24,360
can't handle such a simple task?

275
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:27,320
He had the nerve to say that! Could you have let that slide?!

276
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:29,080
That bastard!

277
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:32,110
My boss was like that, too...

278
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:35,790
I guess interpersonal relationships are a pain in any world.

279
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:38,080
You say you're short on materials?

280
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:42,750
Yeah, I need a special ore called magic ore.

281
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:45,470
We were trying to dig some up yesterday...

282
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:47,990
...but that Armorsaurus showed up.

283
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:49,460
I see.

284
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:53,610
But that mine was pretty well cleared out, anyway.

285
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:55,700
There wasn't any ore left.

286
00:15:56,750 --> 00:16:01,430
And even if I did have the materials,

287
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:03,600
it takes two weeks to make twenty swords!

288
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:09,560
Yet I have to get them to the king in five days.

289
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:13,940
They contracted smiths all over the kingdom and allotted the work to all of us.

290
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:16,990
If I can't do it, my certification as a smith could be revoked.

291
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:18,810
Bro...

292
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:20,580
That really sucks.

293
00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:23,071
Wait...

294
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:25,210
Magic ore? Don't I...

295
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,170
have some of that?!

296
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:36,750
Old man...

297
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:42,180
Can you use that?

298
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,698
Wait...

299
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:49,320
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

300
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,560
That's magic ore!

301
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:54,180
And it's unbelievably pure!

302
00:16:56,700 --> 00:17:00,120
Hey, old man, are you blind?

303
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,143
Huh?!

304
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:06,600
It's not even magic ore!

305
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:09,670
It's already been processed! It's a cluster of magisteel!

306
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:10,781
Precisely!

307
00:17:10,781 --> 00:17:13,580
I can make even stronger swords with this!

308
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:14,880
It can't be...

309
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,210
This entire cluster is...

310
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:20,070
Y-You're sure I can have this?

311
00:17:20,070 --> 00:17:22,350
I'll pay you handsomely, of course!

312
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:25,600
Well, now... I wonder what I should do...

313
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:28,110
What is it you want?

314
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:29,980
I'll do anything in my power for it!

315
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:33,030
That's what I wanted to hear.

316
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:45,370
I'd like you to find some fellow artisans

317
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:49,290
who'll come to my village to teach their crafts to the villagers.

318
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:54,090
That's all you want?

319
00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:58,650
Our priority right now is the "shelter and clothing" part of food, shelter, and clothing.

320
00:17:58,650 --> 00:18:02,810
I'd also like to get some clothing for future use, as well as weapons and armor.

321
00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:08,060
That's easy!

322
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:09,270
But...

323
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:12,350
Even if you start on those swords now...

324
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,190
Can you finish in time?

325
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:18,450
Well, I'll do what I can.

326
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,480
All right, let's get started!

327
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,630
Right!

328
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,000
Oh, yeah.

329
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Great Sage-san, got a minute?

330
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:29,240
Yes.

331
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:32,640
Hey, old man...

332
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:35,530
You said you've already made one, right?

333
00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:37,210
Can I see it?

334
00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:39,630
Oh... Hey.

335
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:43,740
It's magnificent.

336
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:47,640
Even an untrained eye like mine can tell you have real skill.

337
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:50,720
The blade looks like it's shining.

338
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,810
It has a magisteel core.

339
00:18:55,270 --> 00:19:00,600
Put simply, it's a sword that matures in the image of its user.

340
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,200
Amazing!

341
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:06,080
That's incredible! I wish he'd come to the village himself!

342
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:08,590
For that to happen...

343
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:10,330
I'm gonna borrow this sword!

344
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,205
Hey!

345
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:14,320
The sword...

346
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,470
What did you...

347
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:19,490
Rimuru, you...

348
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:20,680
Just give me a second.

349
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:22,710
Great Sage, analyze it.

350
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:25,720
Analyzing: Longsword.

351
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:27,930
Analysis successful.

352
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,890
Use some magisteel clusters to make some copies.

353
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,630
Producing copy.

354
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,110
Successful.

355
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:50,660
Twenty longswords made from magisteel clusters!

356
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:53,670
What?!

357
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:56,580
A party?

358
00:19:56,580 --> 00:20:00,170
Yeah! I made my delivery on time, thanks to you!

359
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:02,550
But you don't have to do that for me.

360
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:06,300
Aw, come on! There'll be lots of cute elf girls there!

361
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:07,130
Elf?!

362
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:09,720
Yeah! It's a place called "Butterflies of the Night"

363
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:13,820
where girls of all ages, from young to mature, wait on you hand and foot!

364
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:15,000
Butterflies...

365
00:20:15,410 --> 00:20:16,440
Speak, man!

366
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:20,060
C'mon, Rimuru. It won't be a party without you.

367
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:21,100
Yeah!

368
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:24,300
Well, if you insist, I suppose I'll have to.

369
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:25,700
That's the spirit!

370
00:20:27,170 --> 00:20:28,610
Sheesh...

371
00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:31,040
What am I gonna do with you guys?

372
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:40,590
Oh, Kaijin! How nice to see you!

373
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,880
Welcome!

374
00:20:44,970 --> 00:20:46,000
Elves!

375
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,020
Elves!

376
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,340
E.I.L.F...

377
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:51,850
I mean, elves!

378
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:55,310
Oh, how cute!

379
00:20:55,810 --> 00:20:58,560
Oh, yesssss!

380
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:01,790
Hey! I had my eye on it first!

381
00:21:01,790 --> 00:21:04,450
Oh, my God! Her dress is so thin!

382
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:07,080
It feels so nice and bouncy!

383
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:09,700
My thoughts exactly...

384
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:15,880
So this is what women's boobs feel like...

385
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,780
I've never felt them before.

386
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:20,500
This must be paradise!

387
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:24,960
After the way you resisted coming here, you sure seem to be enjoying yourself.

388
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:25,800
Huh?

389
00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:27,890
N-No, I wouldn't say that.

390
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:36,020
Well, come on! Let's drink!

391
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:37,980
Yeah!

392
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:42,700
During this time, I was in heaven.

393
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:46,820
I want to live in this valley forever.

394
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:52,400
What a blessed life, so abundant in peaks and valleys!

395
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:58,360
But fun times never last long.

396
00:21:59,170 --> 00:22:02,220
That's just how life is.

397
00:22:17,144 --> 00:22:22,924
Why is it only those who have hope

398
00:22:22,924 --> 00:22:28,421
To fall into despair from the bottom of their heart?

399
00:22:28,421 --> 00:22:33,345
Why is it only those who have courage

400
00:22:33,345 --> 00:22:39,287
To be wounded at the end of their honor?

401
00:22:39,287 --> 00:22:45,004
I don't want to close my eyes in face of sadness

402
00:22:45,004 --> 00:22:50,633
The dawn for new tomorrow was a mere dream to me

403
00:22:50,633 --> 00:22:56,405
Then I see a light falling through the crack of the night

404
00:22:56,405 --> 00:23:02,856
The sky is crying

405
00:23:03,361 --> 00:23:08,925
I don't know what is there at the corner of the world

406
00:23:08,925 --> 00:23:14,541
All I want is to protect those within my reach

407
00:23:14,541 --> 00:23:20,760
Staring at the only reason to fight

408
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:27,946
We who believe the answer to be forgiveness...

409
00:23:27,946 --> 00:23:32,700
Must not lose!

410
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:39,120
Next time, "Hero King, Gazel Dwargo."
