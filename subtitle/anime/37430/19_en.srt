1
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:04,010
Charybdis, the calamity, has awakened,

2
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:07,000
and it's heading straight toward the capital city of Rimuru.

3
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:11,190
It seems like I'm the one it's after... I think.

4
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:21,700
The forces we have ready to go up against Charybdis

5
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:25,210
are Benimaru's group, Gobta and the Goblin riders,

6
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:27,920
the High Orcs led by Geld,

7
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,460
Gabiru and his men,

8
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:33,470
and some help sent by King Gazel:

9
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:37,430
100 Pegasus Knights, led by the knight captain Dorf.

10
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:39,960
Their presence here is definitely reassuring.

11
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,350
It's only natural that I help my junior in his time of need.

12
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:48,490
Yes, sir.

13
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:55,820
For some reason, King Gazel likes to think of himself as my senior...

14
00:00:56,930 --> 00:00:59,200
Well, ready to do this?

15
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,180
Yes, sir!

16
00:01:11,454 --> 00:01:17,021
In the night you could count stars in the sky

17
00:01:17,021 --> 00:01:22,519
The overflown drop reflects the swaying world

18
00:01:22,519 --> 00:01:28,416
All life are in ambivalence

19
00:01:28,416 --> 00:01:33,212
And it twinkles as the days goes by

20
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:39,804
Both short-lived flowers and devastating winds

21
00:01:39,804 --> 00:01:44,056
are the sign of the passing present

22
00:01:44,851 --> 00:01:50,842
To those who live in the moment, this song shall reach you

23
00:01:50,842 --> 00:01:58,932
It will push you to the limits of freedom, telling you to survive

24
00:01:58,932 --> 00:02:01,707
We will find the way

25
00:02:01,707 --> 00:02:10,040
We returners all equally carry a seed of hope

26
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:16,543
Under the whim of miracle, Birth and Demise shall join hand

27
00:02:16,543 --> 00:02:20,602
and the time will flow once again

28
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:41,010
Eat this! Hell Flare!

29
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:51,510
That's my Benimaru. He toasted that thing to a crisp.

30
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:52,530
But...

31
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:56,400
It's shocking that even his attack wasn't enough to destroy it.

32
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:58,590
Is that one of Charybdis's skills?

33
00:02:58,900 --> 00:02:59,580
Notice.

34
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:02,110
With the extra skill Magic Jamming,

35
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:05,860
the movement of magicules in a 300-meter radius is disturbed,

36
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:07,660
reducing the efficacy of magic.

37
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:09,960
So this guy's going to be trouble...

38
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:13,580
Stick to the plan! Scatter them and strike each one individually!

39
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:23,200
I'll stop it from moving! All of you, attack!

40
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,550
Sir Geld!

41
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:34,230
Attack!

42
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:42,730
Well, now what?

43
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:46,680
My comrades can't do anything now, so to attack this thing...

44
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:49,580
Let me give you a hand!

45
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:52,860
Vortex Crash!

46
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:58,920
Sir Gabiru, you're so cool!

47
00:03:58,920 --> 00:03:59,600
Indeed!

48
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,640
Tend to the wounded!

49
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,670
We're on it!

50
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:07,560
Since you stopped it, I had a much easier time taking it down!

51
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:10,100
Thank you for the assistance, Gabiru.

52
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:15,940
We'll bring that one down! You can take it from there!

53
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:18,690
Right! I'll stop it myself this time!

54
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:22,190
Sir Gabiru, you're so cool!

55
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:28,280
On the pride of the Pegasus Knights, we will stop them here and now!

56
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,790
Fall back for now!

57
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:49,950
Some will divert, others will attack.

58
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:52,800
Enter this battle with a clear understanding of your own role...

59
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,560
and without fear of death!

60
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:58,560
Hakurou's such a pro at giving orders.

61
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:02,570
Regaining his youth has allowed him to refine his tough teaching style.

62
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:05,930
Hey, I wanna play, too!

63
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:09,740
Why are you here? Didn't I tell you to wait back in town?

64
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:12,580
B-But I can watch, at least, can't I?

65
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:14,330
Staying in town is boring!

66
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:18,080
Come on, I'll just—

67
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,190
No!

68
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:23,460
Looking at me like that won't help.

69
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:26,450
Now, Master Souei!

70
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:27,281
Right!

71
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:30,760
Puppet Strings!

72
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:42,650
Wow! He's manipulating the Megalodons to make them fight each other!

73
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:46,150
Anything goes for that dreamboat, huh?

74
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:48,838
Wait for the right moment, then kill it.

75
00:05:48,838 --> 00:05:51,590
Understood. Leave the rest to us.

76
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:04,790
They're flying? When did Ranga learn that?

77
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:07,420
Also, when did he team up with Shion?

78
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:11,050
I must play an active role and stand out this time.

79
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,930
Indeed. I feel the same way!

80
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:20,230
Decapitating Demon Blade!

81
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:28,900
Let me, too! Let me, too!

82
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:30,990
I told you, it's not happening.

83
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,250
Now, that just leaves...

84
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:47,010
Let's see just how strong it is!

85
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:49,260
That's our Ranga!

86
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,560
Disappointing.

87
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:08,190
You have improved a bit, but to think you couldn't even stop one of them...

88
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:11,430
You will need much tougher training.

89
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:14,830
Hey! Anything tougher than this is gonna kill me, old man!

90
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,200
Old man, you say?

91
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,100
Great Rimuru.

92
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:28,550
So all that's left now is Charybdis...

93
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:31,160
With his ability, it shouldn't be a problem.

94
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,550
Besides...

95
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:41,810
That thing sure is huge, though...

96
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:42,860
Answer.

97
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:44,777
Judging from its size, the—

98
00:07:44,777 --> 00:07:45,700
I don't need to hear it!

99
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:48,850
If you're gonna say something, tell me the easiest way to beat it.

100
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,570
Now she shuts up...

101
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,580
Looks like they're not even leaving a mark.

102
00:07:57,970 --> 00:07:58,950
True.

103
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:03,950
It might try to pull something! Don't let your guard down!

104
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:04,830
Roger!

105
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:05,580
Right!

106
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:07,920
Understood, Master!

107
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,180
Evade! Get away from it!

108
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:47,750
I can't dodge them!

109
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:50,630
Dodge? Don't be a weakling!

110
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:05,270
Souei, use Shadow Movement to escape.

111
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:07,770
I will act as Shion's shield.

112
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:10,160
You fool! Do you want to die, Ranga?!

113
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:12,150
I'll do this alone!

114
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:18,160
Great Rimuru's chosen course of action is the one granting the highest chance of survival.

115
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,370
Highest chance of survival, eh?

116
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:22,030
In that case, I'll stay, too.

117
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:24,330
Oh, don't get the wrong idea.

118
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:27,420
The real me will withdraw before I get killed, so don't worry.

119
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:30,400
Typical Souei...

120
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:32,920
In that case, let us all survive!

121
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:45,030
You guys really are idiots.

122
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:50,270
You could at least rely on me at a time like this.

123
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:51,530
Great Rimuru!

124
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:55,190
Devour all! Gluttony!

125
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:07,500
All those scales, in a mere instant...

126
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:12,540
Leave the rest to me. You guys fall back and rest for a bit.

127
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:14,050
We can still help you!

128
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:17,300
Take it easy. Look.

129
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,440
The scales are starting to regenerate.

130
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,060
The next time it uses those,

131
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,120
I don't know if I'll be able to protect you again.

132
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:34,070
I'll fight it for a while. Attack at Benimaru's order.

133
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:37,440
I wish you luck.

134
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:39,700
Be careful, Great Rimuru!

135
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:42,940
Master, I will return to help you shortly!

136
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:44,300
Yeah.

137
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:53,090
Now, then... I guess I'll just do whatever I can.

138
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:13,900
Is it actually hurting... a little?

139
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:15,900
But...

140
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:20,490
Hey, does this thing have Rapid Regeneration?

141
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:21,520
Answer.

142
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:24,070
Judging from the speed at which it repairs its body tissue,

143
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:25,780
there is no doubt that the individual Charybdis

144
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:30,250
possesses the extra skill "Ultraspeed Regeneration."

145
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:35,090
Using Ultraspeed Regeneration, it is estimated that

146
00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:37,724
it will regenerate all its scales within three minutes.

147
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:41,930
So we have three minutes before a repeat of what it did earlier...

148
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:52,060
Everyone, utilize all methods at your disposal to attack Charybdis!

149
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:56,310
Even if the effects are weak! Don't give it a chance to recover!

150
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:58,320
Yeah!

151
00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:03,320
The support of the Pegasus Knights increased our strength more than tenfold,

152
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:08,040
so we thought we'd take down with an all-out attack, but...

153
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:19,610
I think Charybdis is damaged by about 30% at most...

154
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:24,280
An all-out attack managed 30%... This is looking bad.

155
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:26,570
What do we do?

156
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:30,410
D-Damn you...

157
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:34,300
M-Milim...

158
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,100
Milim?

159
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:37,870
You just said "Milim," didn't you?

160
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:40,860
Great Sage, use Appraisal!

161
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:41,860
Answer.

162
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:45,710
Signs of life confirmed from the body that Charybdis has occupied.

163
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:49,370
The body appears to possess intense anger.

164
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:51,120
Intense anger?

165
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:52,740
Toward Milim?

166
00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:59,220
So basically, Charybdis headed toward our town because Milim was there?

167
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:03,380
I thought it had figured out that Veldora was inside me...

168
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:05,630
I guess I was overthinking it.

169
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:06,800
Wait!

170
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:09,300
Can't I depend on Milim for this, then?!

171
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:11,720
Hey, she's asleep!

172
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:14,544
Milim!

173
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,940
I wasn't asleep! I was awake the whole time!

174
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,190
No, you were obviously asleep.

175
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:22,320
I was just meditating!

176
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,690
I was really cheering you guys on!

177
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:30,200
Listen, this guy seems to have business with you.

178
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,200
What?!

179
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:37,230
It looks like it's using that guy who came into town, Phobio, as its physical body.

180
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:39,840
That guy? Really?

181
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:45,590
Anyway, I had you sit this one out because I thought he was after me, but...

182
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:48,720
Are you gonna say I can fight him?!

183
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:57,080
He was here for you, and we were just in the way. Sorry about that.

184
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:59,410
It's fine! Don't worry about it!

185
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:00,310
I'll get him!

186
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:01,608
Oh, also...

187
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:05,440
Phobio works for the Demon Lord Carrion, right?

188
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,990
So I'd like to let him live and help him out...

189
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:12,100
That won't be a problem!

190
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:14,996
I'll show you how much restraint I've learned recently!

191
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:16,780
Restraint?

192
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:19,120
Does she really mean that?

193
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:22,040
Get away from here immediately!

194
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:33,470
Mili... Milim!

195
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:40,000
I've already seen that trick.

196
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,480
Now, I'll show you one of mine.

197
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,280
This is...

198
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:53,240
what you call "restraint"!

199
00:14:54,490 --> 00:14:57,750
Drago Buster!

200
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:07,480
Where the hell is the "restraint"?

201
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,588
There he is!

202
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:17,430
Gotcha.

203
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:23,650
That was some nice restraint.

204
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:54,982
Notice.

205
00:15:54,982 --> 00:16:00,140
The magicore of Charybdis has been removed from Phobio and consumed.

206
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:02,730
Preparing to isolate it and begin Appraisal.

207
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:13,320
That should do it.

208
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,430
Rimuru.

209
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:17,850
Oh, Dorf-san. I appreciate your help.

210
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:20,450
We were able to defeat Charybdis thanks to you.

211
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:24,250
No, it wasn't us who defeated Charybdis.

212
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:27,750
Could you explain what this is all about?

213
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:30,390
Well, um, actually...

214
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:33,260
this girl is called Demon Lord Milim, and... you see?

215
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:39,670
Demon Lord?

216
00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:45,560
I see you have a fondness for jokes, Rimuru!

217
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:49,320
If you had such a powerful magical weapon,

218
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,950
I wish you had said so from the start!

219
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:55,050
It's no joke! I'm a Demon Lord!

220
00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:57,420
I defeated Charybdis!

221
00:16:57,830 --> 00:17:01,440
I see. You wish to keep the specifics of your weapon secret.

222
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,930
I understand that.

223
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:05,640
It's always best to keep your trump card hidden.

224
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,630
I'm telling you, I'm a Demon Lord!

225
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:11,800
Charybdis could have had catastrophic effects on all mankind,

226
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,420
so its defeat is most fortuitous.

227
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:17,920
I must report to my king, so I will take my leave now.

228
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,050
Hey, damn it!

229
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:20,900
You were a great help.

230
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:23,140
Give King Gazel my regards.

231
00:17:28,450 --> 00:17:30,150
Hey. You awake?

232
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:34,410
Where... am I?

233
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:37,500
What... What did I...

234
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:40,800
Do you remember what you did?

235
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:44,810
I'm so sorry!

236
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:48,330
I've done something unthinkable to Lady Milim,

237
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:51,210
and I've caused so much trouble for you!

238
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:52,190
Why did you do—

239
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:55,450
How did you know where Charybdis was sealed?

240
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:58,970
We won't accept that you just happened to find it.

241
00:17:58,970 --> 00:17:59,930
You heard her.

242
00:17:59,930 --> 00:18:02,430
Right... You see...

243
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:08,020
Masked harlequins named Tear and Footman?

244
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:10,760
Did the mask look like this?

245
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:15,690
No, the ones I met were a girl in a mask with a tear under one eye

246
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:18,110
and a heavy man with an angry mask.

247
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:20,120
Um...

248
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:22,190
That Laplace guy also..

249
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:23,340
Laplace?

250
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:29,492
Laplace once showed up before me as a servant of Gelmud.

251
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:33,380
He was wearing a mask like the one Treyni described.

252
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:38,570
Also, he called himself the vice president of a jack-of-all-trades group

253
00:18:38,570 --> 00:18:40,520
called the Moderate Harlequin Alliance.

254
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,640
Well, now the dots are connected.

255
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:44,200
I see.

256
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:47,260
And this person's name was Laplace?

257
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:50,080
Footman, huh?

258
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,520
We'll have to remember that name.

259
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:54,400
Yes, Brother.

260
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:58,420
A mysterious jack-of-all-trades group, the Moderate Harlequin Alliance?

261
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:00,190
They pretend they're helping you,

262
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:04,410
then use you to fulfill their goals without getting their own hands dirty...

263
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:06,590
They sound like they'll be trouble.

264
00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:09,170
I don't know anything about them!

265
00:19:09,170 --> 00:19:13,790
In fact, if fun people like that are really out there, I wanna meet them!

266
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:18,150
It may be that it wasn't Gelmud,

267
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:22,560
but Clayman who's plotting something in secret.

268
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,268
Clayman?

269
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:28,400
He loves coming up with schemes like that.

270
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,730
The Demon Lord Clayman...

271
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:33,690
Regardless of whose scheme I was roped into,

272
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:36,430
what happened was my own responsibility.

273
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:39,420
It has nothing to do with Demon Lord Carrion, so please...

274
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:41,450
Take my life and leave him out of this!

275
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:46,200
Next time, be more on your toes so you won't be fooled again.

276
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:47,870
Huh?

277
00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:50,440
You can move now, right? So you can go.

278
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,900
But... what I did was unforgivable!

279
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:56,210
I don't even want your life.

280
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:57,620
Right, Milim?

281
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:59,620
Yeah, totally!

282
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:02,610
I thought I'd give him just one little whack,

283
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:04,720
but I've matured so much, after all.

284
00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:06,870
You were going to hit him?

285
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:10,040
I'm not mad at all, so I forgive you!

286
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:12,150
There you go. So don't worry about it.

287
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:13,240
That's right!

288
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:15,800
That's okay with you, right, Carrion?

289
00:20:18,930 --> 00:20:21,180
L-Lord Carrion!

290
00:20:22,570 --> 00:20:24,210
So you figured it out, Milim?

291
00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:25,490
Of course I did!

292
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:28,680
So this guy is the Demon Lord Carrion...

293
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:29,726
Yo.

294
00:20:29,726 --> 00:20:33,250
Thanks for sparing this guy's life.

295
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:40,030
You're the masked majin who defeated Gelmud, are you not?

296
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:41,760
Yeah, that's right.

297
00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:45,890
Are you here to avenge him?

298
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,840
Nah. Get up.

299
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:51,980
Y-Yes, sir!

300
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,280
Sorry about that.

301
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:03,060
Huh?

302
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:05,470
It seems my underling here was out of control.

303
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:07,870
That means I was negligent in his oversight.

304
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:09,390
I hope you'll forgive him.

305
00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:10,870
S-Sure...

306
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:13,730
I owe you one after all this.

307
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:16,870
If anything comes up, you can always count on me.

308
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:22,820
In that case, I'd appreciate it if you'd enter a non-aggression pact with our nation.

309
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:25,850
That's all you want? Very well.

310
00:21:26,290 --> 00:21:28,050
The Demon Lord... no...

311
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:33,150
The Beastmaster of the Animal Kingdom of Eurazania, Carrion,

312
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:36,060
swears on his name to never raise a blade to your nation.

313
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:37,441
Thanks.

314
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,478
All right.

315
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:42,890
Come on, we're out.

316
00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:45,280
Uh, he's losing tons of blood!

317
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:48,310
Well, I'll see you again, Rimuru.

318
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:54,540
Now, then...

319
00:21:56,130 --> 00:21:57,420
I guess that's over.

320
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,300
Let's head home.

321
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,320
Yes, sir!

322
00:22:05,513 --> 00:22:12,394
I have to believe in me that you believe in

323
00:22:12,394 --> 00:22:20,858
A story just started, carrying a name

324
00:22:22,326 --> 00:22:29,050
Whether it's a concidence or a fate, who cares?

325
00:22:29,050 --> 00:22:34,787
Just pick one thing in here

326
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:42,242
Just from one chance, the future would change

327
00:22:42,242 --> 00:22:48,737
Along with the sky, the wind, and the land

328
00:22:48,737 --> 00:22:55,762
It's all because you keep believing in that possiblity

329
00:22:55,762 --> 00:23:02,315
That I can also keep believing. With my power...

330
00:23:02,315 --> 00:23:05,643
In the depths of the world that we must protect,

331
00:23:05,643 --> 00:23:08,997
rise up as many times as it take

332
00:23:08,997 --> 00:23:15,064
If I can't hold it with both hands, I'll lend it to you

333
00:23:15,674 --> 00:23:22,368
Even if you got shaken, face foward for the smile you wish to protect

334
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:27,294
There's a scenary I want to show you,

335
00:23:27,294 --> 00:23:29,815
let's go togehter

336
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:38,530
Next time, "Yuuki Kagurazaka."
