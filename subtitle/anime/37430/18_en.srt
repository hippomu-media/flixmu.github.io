1
00:00:10,424 --> 00:00:15,991
In the night you could count stars in the sky

2
00:00:15,991 --> 00:00:21,489
The overflown drop reflects the swaying world

3
00:00:21,489 --> 00:00:27,386
All life are in ambivalence

4
00:00:27,386 --> 00:00:32,182
And it twinkles as the days goes by

5
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:38,774
Both short-lived flowers and devastating winds

6
00:00:38,774 --> 00:00:43,026
are the sign of the passing present

7
00:00:43,821 --> 00:00:49,812
To those who live in the moment, this song shall reach you

8
00:00:49,812 --> 00:00:57,902
It will push you to the limits of freedom, telling you to survive

9
00:00:57,902 --> 00:01:00,677
We will find the way

10
00:01:00,677 --> 00:01:09,010
We returners all equally carry a seed of hope

11
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:15,513
Under the whim of miracle, Birth and Demise shall join hand

12
00:01:15,513 --> 00:01:19,572
and the time will flow once again

13
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:33,980
What do you think you're doing to my bestie's subordinate?!

14
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:49,140
Damn it! She'll pay for that!

15
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,840
Who does she think I am?

16
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,050
I'm Phobio the Black Leopard Fang!

17
00:01:56,470 --> 00:02:00,080
With the Demon Lord Milim in the picture, it's beyond our control.

18
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:02,720
Even for the Demon Lord Carrion.

19
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,070
You idiot!

20
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:07,340
Lord Carrion wouldn't have humiliated himself like this!

21
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:09,940
I just wasn't good enough.

22
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:15,990
But my pride won't allow me to go back empty-handed.

23
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:21,280
Those guys built a town all on their own.

24
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,430
I saw them as no more than lowly monsters,

25
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:27,690
but they have skills and techniques that even we lack.

26
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:29,740
That's for sure.

27
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:31,860
Instead of ordering them to serve us,

28
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:35,550
I'd like to see Eurazania establish diplomatic relations with them.

29
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:39,090
Yeah. Even if the Demon Lord Milim hadn't been involved,

30
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:41,680
I handled that all wrong.

31
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:46,930
I couldn't have gained their trust by just taking over without giving them a say.

32
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:49,320
But it's too late now.

33
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:53,890
My wounds may heal, but this humiliation will never fade.

34
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:56,560
I want to take revenge somehow,

35
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,240
so I won't cause trouble for Lord Carrion.

36
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:03,530
That's easy to say, but revenge isn't realistic...

37
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:06,660
I know that! I know in my head that it won't work!

38
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:11,330
Still, I just can't rationalize this!

39
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:17,000
Who's there?!

40
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:30,100
Oh, how well I understand that vexation you must be feeling!

41
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,860
Greetings, fine people!

42
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:35,480
My name is Footman.

43
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:37,110
Footman?

44
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,530
I am a member of the Moderate Harlequin Alliance,

45
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:43,420
the one they call Footman the Angry Pierrot!

46
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:45,820
Pleasure to make your acquaintance!

47
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:50,080
Now, please don't be so guarded.

48
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:54,290
I'm Tear, and I'm not your enemy!

49
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:55,970
What do you want?

50
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:03,470
Well, I was summoned here by your anger and hatred.

51
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,900
Anger and hatred?

52
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:09,270
I sensed some choice waves of anger, you see.

53
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:14,680
Please tell me what has angered you so.

54
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:18,760
I'm certain I can be of some help to you.

55
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:26,140
Sir Phobio, there is no need to listen to these people.

56
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,660
May I remove them from your presence?

57
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:32,700
We are the Beast King's Beastketeers, serving the Demon Lord Carrion.

58
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:36,180
Do you honestly think you wandering majin are any match for us?

59
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:39,080
You desire power, do you not?

60
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:43,120
We have it... power akin to none you've ever seen.

61
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:46,820
Naturally, however, it comes with great risk.

62
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:49,920
But should you triumph over that risk,

63
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:52,140
the power you stand to gain is immense.

64
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,020
Oh?

65
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:55,270
Sir Phobio!

66
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,730
You want to defeat the Demon Lord Milim, right?

67
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:02,150
Then you just need to become a Demon Lord yourself!

68
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:04,530
Demon... Lord?!

69
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:14,160
A Demon Lord? You think you can fool me with nonsense like that?

70
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:15,829
Charybdis.

71
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:21,810
Have you heard of it?

72
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:24,920
Did you say... Charybdis?

73
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:30,710
Yeah, if you had the evil power of that gigantic beast-fish,

74
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:33,220
you'd be a Demon Lord's equal...

75
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:36,020
But if you don't want it, we'll just go find someone who does!

76
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,560
Come on, let's go!

77
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:42,480
What a shame.

78
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:43,570
Wait!

79
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:47,720
Sir Phobio, you mustn't!

80
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,940
I haven't liked any of this from the start.

81
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:55,250
Why was a useless Orc Lord chosen to be a Demon Lord?

82
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:56,810
That's bull!

83
00:05:56,810 --> 00:06:00,340
If they need a new Demon Lord, I'll...

84
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:05,340
I'll get stronger! Then even Lord Carrion will forgive me with a smile!

85
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:06,830
Sir Phobio...

86
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:08,470
Tell me more!

87
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,860
Ah! I knew the great Sir Phobio would understand!

88
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:16,600
Yes, of course! There is none more suited than you to be a Demon Lord!

89
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:20,350
It's just wrong for anyone who isn't strong to be a Demon Lord, right?!

90
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:22,060
That's how I feel, too!

91
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:24,730
And as far as that goes, you're perfect for the job!

92
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:31,920
What do you two stand to gain from this deal?

93
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:33,650
What are you after?

94
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:37,340
We just want you to give us special treatment once you become a Demon Lord!

95
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:40,420
We'd like you to do a few favors for us, too!

96
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:46,440
We cannot subdue Charybdis on our own, after all.

97
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:49,430
We managed to find the place where it's been sealed away,

98
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:51,800
but as it is now, we're just sitting on a gold mine!

99
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:55,180
And we just happened to find you at the perfect time!

100
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:57,560
I see.

101
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:01,940
But there's no telling whether I can subdue Charybdis or not...

102
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:06,810
If anyone can do it, it's you, great Sir Phobio!

103
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:08,400
You'll be fine!

104
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:11,290
So when I become a Demon Lord,

105
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:15,650
they want to be the ones credited for helping me the most?

106
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:21,130
All right, I accept your offer.

107
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,460
You three can go back.

108
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:29,030
Sir Phobio!

109
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:31,090
Report on everything that has happened.

110
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,380
But..

111
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:35,410
I can't cause trouble for Lord Carrion.

112
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:39,390
Tell him I'm resigning my position in the Beastketeers and leaving the service.

113
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:42,700
Thank you for all you've done for me.

114
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:44,650
Sir Phobio...

115
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:49,900
I will become carnage itself and force the Demon Lord Milim to acknowledge my power.

116
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:53,160
Very well.

117
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:56,390
I will report to Lord Carrion.

118
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:59,650
But the extent of Charybdis's power is unknown.

119
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:01,870
Please be extremely careful.

120
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:13,200
Sir Phobio is not a fool.

121
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:16,320
Even if Charybdis really is out there,

122
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,500
I'm sure he can subdue it.

123
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:25,900
Now, let us be on our way.

124
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:30,520
Yeah. If my power and that of Charybdis can be combined,

125
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:35,280
I bet I can turn Demon Lord Milim's annoying face into a sobbing mess.

126
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:37,790
That's the spirit!

127
00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:40,350
Yeah! I'll be cheering you on!

128
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,680
What do you think of that?! I won!

129
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:57,550
I can stay underwater longer than you two!

130
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:59,850
No, it was I who won.

131
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:03,930
No, it was only by a slight margin, but I won.

132
00:09:04,130 --> 00:09:07,840
No fair refusing to admit defeat, Shion and Shuna!

133
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:11,440
Okay, then, we'll do it again! Let's settle the score!

134
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:13,780
Very well. One more time.

135
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:18,110
It's really not a good idea to stay underwater in the bath, but let's do it.

136
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:19,660
Ready... go!

137
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:24,210
Seems like they're having fun.

138
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:26,930
Maybe I should've gone to that side.

139
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:28,210
Over here is just...

140
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:30,280
an old dude.

141
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:34,840
Hey, how long do you intend to stay in this town?

142
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:37,930
Are you still not convinced that we're harmless?

143
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,610
Huh? Ah, no...

144
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:44,310
My suspicion of you is long gone now.

145
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,010
Then why?

146
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:50,270
Well, this place is just so comfortable.

147
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:53,160
I haven't had a real break in so long.

148
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:56,650
I felt it would be a good thing to slow down and relax.

149
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:58,890
Come on, man...

150
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:05,020
"I will see for myself whether or not you are truly an ally of Humans."

151
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:08,040
After you sounded so cool saying that...

152
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,290
He's not even listening!

153
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,140
Hey!

154
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:11,830
Eh?

155
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,920
What's going on with Youm and his guys, anyway?

156
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:19,550
You promised to help make them look like the champions in our place!

157
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:21,050
Ah...

158
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:22,850
"Ah" isn't an answer!

159
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:25,020
Those guys already left, you know!

160
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:28,640
They went to build a reputation as champions everywhere.

161
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:30,920
That won't be a problem.

162
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:33,620
I've already finished setting things up.

163
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:34,780
You have?

164
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:36,110
Yes.

165
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:40,160
I've already laid the groundwork for spreading the word that they're

166
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,030
the champions who defeated the Orc Lord,

167
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:47,370
and for spreading the rumor that you and your people

168
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:49,560
are the harmless monsters who helped them.

169
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:53,250
Oh... Well, good, then.

170
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,140
He may be taking it easy, but I guess he's done his part.

171
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:00,180
Well, I'll be heading back now.

172
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,720
Oh, I almost forgot.

173
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:06,190
I'd like to build a road from here to your Kingdom of Blumund.

174
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:06,930
Eh?

175
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:09,520
Er... Wha? Oh, well...

176
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:11,900
I'd certainly appreciate that,

177
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:14,150
but that would be a national undertaking on a huge scale.

178
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:16,080
The budget would be immense.

179
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,530
Exactly, Fuze-kun!

180
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:19,370
K-Kun?

181
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:23,910
Somehow, hearing you call me that makes me feel uneasy...

182
00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:26,520
Don't worry about that, Fuze-kun!

183
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:30,160
Having a road would make it easier for us to do business, wouldn't it?

184
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:33,880
Naturally, we'll handle the physical work.

185
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:35,500
However...

186
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,670
However?

187
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:40,990
I want to sell our specially-made goods to other countries,

188
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:44,500
so I'd like you to introduce me to someone who can give all the advice I need.

189
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,770
Very well. That's a simple matter!

190
00:11:47,770 --> 00:11:49,000
Good, good.

191
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:54,430
Maybe I should go over there after all...

192
00:11:58,330 --> 00:11:59,380
It's in here?

193
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:00,440
Yep!

194
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:05,730
It hasn't been revived yet, but its thirst for destruction is pouring out.

195
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:10,100
Such emotions are our absolute favorite treat.

196
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:12,220
That is how we were able to find it.

197
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,910
You're right... I can feel something bizarre in the air.

198
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:19,820
Charybdis...

199
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:25,840
Under normal circumstances,

200
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:28,490
reviving Charybdis would require many corpses.

201
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:29,350
Corpses?

202
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:33,640
Charybdis is a type of spiritual lifeform.

203
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:36,400
In order to use its power in this world,

204
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:39,150
one must give it a physical body.

205
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,490
I get it. And?

206
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:44,030
Your role in all this is...

207
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:48,870
Wait, are you saying...

208
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:54,210
By "subdue," we mean that you take Charybdis into your body

209
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:58,080
and unite with it as one being!

210
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:00,610
Into my body?

211
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:03,160
If you want out, now's your chance!

212
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:04,680
But...

213
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:05,470
But?

214
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:09,220
This seal might not hold out much longer.

215
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:12,390
And if it doesn't, then what?

216
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:16,060
It would eventually revive on its own... I guess?

217
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:17,850
But it needs corpses, right?

218
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:20,330
Yes, but even though it's sealed,

219
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:25,530
I'm sure it could acquire the corpses necessary for revival on its own.

220
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:29,550
And if it does, we might just drop dead!

221
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:30,910
Yes, that's right!

222
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:35,160
If it revives on its own, it'll be uncontrollable,

223
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:40,060
and with an untainted will to destroy, it won't take orders from anyone.

224
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:43,450
So we need to break the seal before it revives itself

225
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:46,260
and take its power for ourselves first?

226
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,320
Huh?

227
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:49,790
Y-Yeah! Exactly!

228
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:51,110
Very perceptive!

229
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:52,720
Fine.

230
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:56,680
I'll make the power of Charybdis my own.

231
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:06,430
I'll do it.

232
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:10,030
I'll subdue Charybdis within my own body

233
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:14,320
and show that impertinent Demon Lord Milim!

234
00:14:18,694 --> 00:14:20,350
Well, he went in.

235
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:21,740
He sure did.

236
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:26,100
He is truly a minion of Carrion's, with muscles for brains.

237
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:28,060
Yeah, that was easy!

238
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:32,680
Is this job completed now?

239
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:39,000
Clayman only told me to revive Charybdis and send it Milim's way.

240
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:39,899
Oh!

241
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:44,880
Guess we don't need the lesser dragon corpses I gathered up anymore.

242
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:49,460
But so long as we're prepared, we've nothing to worry about!

243
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:58,530
So heavy...

244
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:02,830
Another great haul today!

245
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:06,550
Milim's truly amazing!

246
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:11,260
She can locate monsters right away, so hunting is a breeze!

247
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:15,160
Detecting monsters is a piece of cake!

248
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,770
We'll have another feast tonight!

249
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:19,720
Yep, great work, great work.

250
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,900
It was a lot of work, all right.

251
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:24,400
Who's up for a bath and a drink?

252
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:26,330
I'm up for a drink!

253
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:29,820
Lady Milim!

254
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:32,450
Who's there?!

255
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:33,690
Whoa, hey!

256
00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:35,080
Gotcha!

257
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:36,410
This presence...

258
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,520
Treyni-san?

259
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:46,960
No, she's not quite the same...

260
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:49,340
I-It's a Dryad!

261
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:50,980
I've never seen one before...

262
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:55,570
I am the Dryad Trya,

263
00:15:55,570 --> 00:15:57,350
younger sister of Treyni.

264
00:15:57,350 --> 00:15:59,020
She has a younger sister?!

265
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:02,660
Uh, anyway, what's with that form and the murderous aura?

266
00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:05,280
There is an emergency.

267
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:07,570
Calamity is approaching.

268
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:08,690
Calamity?

269
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:13,360
A calamity-class monster, Charybdis, has been revived.

270
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:14,860
Charybdis?

271
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,660
Its violence equals that of a Demon Lord.

272
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:24,310
My sisters, including Treyni, have set out to slow its progress,

273
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:26,000
but they are no match for it.

274
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:29,660
And it appears Charybdis is heading

275
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:31,550
for this land.

276
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:32,170
Huh?!

277
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:40,150
Against Charybdis, the Ruler of the Skies, waging war on land is futile.

278
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:43,480
I have come to advise you to bolster your defenses

279
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:47,410
and prepare an airborne combat force as soon as possible.

280
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:53,570
Charybdis was born long, long ago,

281
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:56,750
and has died and revived many times.

282
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:59,330
It is a violent Ruler of the Skies.

283
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:02,940
No less is expected of the child

284
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:06,830
of Veldora, the ruler and guardian of the forest.

285
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:08,840
Veldora's child?

286
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:14,840
Charybdis was generated from a cloud of Veldora's magicules.

287
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:19,360
So does that mean Charybdis and I are sort of like brothers?

288
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:24,260
Oh, so is it coming this way because it's after me?

289
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:28,140
Maybe it figured out that Veldora is inside me...

290
00:17:28,930 --> 00:17:33,550
If Charybdis has revived, it is a threat greater than a Demon Lord.

291
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:38,280
Unlike a Demon Lord, this is not an opponent we can speak with.

292
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:41,030
You might as well call it a monster with no intelligence.

293
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:46,410
It's said that it calls shark-like summon monsters called Megalodons

294
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:50,670
from the spirit world to join it in its rampage.

295
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:54,670
What the heck? That sounds worse than the Orc Lord...

296
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:56,680
The situation could not be worse.

297
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:59,080
Its summoned Megalodons have occupied

298
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:03,430
some lesser dragon corpses that were nearby for some unknown reason.

299
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,430
Huh?

300
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,450
They number thirteen.

301
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:09,020
So there's one beast as bad as a Demon Lord,

302
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:11,940
and thirteen flying sharks that it summoned?

303
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:14,830
What the hell kind of joke is this?

304
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:17,450
Great Rimuru, what shall we do?

305
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,110
What do we do? I mean...

306
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:24,210
Haven't you forgotten something important?

307
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:26,040
That stupid Charybdis...

308
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,830
is no match for me!

309
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:30,750
I'll whoop its butt in no time!

310
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:32,710
Oh, yeah! That's one way!

311
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:35,430
We cannot do that.

312
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:37,630
This is our town's problem.

313
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:40,010
Hey, secretary! Don't turn her down for me!

314
00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:42,680
Huh? But I'm his besti—

315
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:43,810
She's right.

316
00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:47,230
It's wrong to rely on you for everything just because you're a friend.

317
00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:50,590
When Great Rimuru is in desperate need of help,

318
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:53,480
we would certainly appreciate your assistance then.

319
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:55,920
Uh, I'm in pretty desperate need now!

320
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,390
They're right, Milim.

321
00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:01,370
Just have faith in me.

322
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:08,330
And I thought... I'd finally get my chance to shine...

323
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:11,040
Well, it seems like it's after me.

324
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:13,560
I can't rely too much on Milim.

325
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:18,460
Begin preparations to defeat Charybdis!

326
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:19,720
Yes, sir!

327
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:21,723
I wanted to show my bestie what I can do...

328
00:19:21,723 --> 00:19:23,250
Defeat it?

329
00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:26,300
Are you sure you understand?

330
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:30,850
You're up against a beast that even the Dryads couldn't stop.

331
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:35,110
We can count on backup from King Gazel, since we signed that treaty.

332
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:36,860
We'll just do all we can.

333
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:39,400
You aren't going to run away?

334
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,420
What good would that do?

335
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:43,760
I'm the strongest one in this nation.

336
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:50,370
If it looks like I stand no chance, I'll run away and think up a new plan,

337
00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:55,170
but otherwise, I should see how strong it is with my own eyes, right?

338
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:58,680
I see.

339
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:01,220
You are the leader of the monsters, after all.

340
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:06,110
We're not like Humans who are done for if they lose their king.

341
00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:08,350
But you know...

342
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:13,470
You think much like we Humans do.

343
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:15,860
It's hard to see you as a monster.

344
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:18,940
Hmm, maybe...

345
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:23,860
It might be hard to believe, but I actually used to be human.

346
00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:26,410
You know about Shizu-san, right?

347
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:30,120
I think I'm an Otherworlder, just like she was.

348
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:32,460
I died in my world...

349
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:38,000
and was reborn here as a slime.

350
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:40,840
Shizu...

351
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:47,170
Shizu-san entrusted everything to me as someone from the same homeland.

352
00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:51,800
I gained this form in exchange for inheriting her will.

353
00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:58,060
I can't go making dumb mistakes in Shizu-san's form, right?

354
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:00,150
I see...

355
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:03,280
So Rimuru really is someone we can trust!

356
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:07,360
Besides, I made a promise to her.

357
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,620
A promise?

358
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:13,090
That I'd clear away the feelings that bind her heart.

359
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:17,880
My prey is the Demon Lord Leon.

360
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,380
The Demon Lord Leon?!

361
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:21,120
H-He is?!

362
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:24,620
You can't call a major figure like him your "prey"!

363
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:27,390
I mean, compared to the Demon Lord Leon,

364
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:30,890
I guess Charybdis would be easier to handle... maybe?

365
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:32,090
Yeah.

366
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:33,930
The Demon Lord Leon comes later.

367
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:36,520
Charybdis comes first.

368
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:40,520
A battle was about to begin.

369
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:42,100
It would take place in between

370
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:44,360
the capital of the Jura Tempest Federation,

371
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:46,050
the city of Rimuru,

372
00:21:46,050 --> 00:21:48,760
and the Armed Nation of Dwargon.

373
00:21:49,410 --> 00:21:50,521
The opponent is...

374
00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:02,320
the calamity-class Charybdis.

375
00:22:05,513 --> 00:22:12,394
I have to believe in me that you believe in

376
00:22:12,394 --> 00:22:20,858
A story just started, carrying a name

377
00:22:22,326 --> 00:22:29,050
Whether it's a concidence or a fate, who cares?

378
00:22:29,050 --> 00:22:34,787
Just pick one thing in here

379
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:42,242
Just from one chance, the future would change

380
00:22:42,242 --> 00:22:48,737
Along with the sky, the wind, and the land

381
00:22:48,737 --> 00:22:55,762
It's all because you keep believing in that possiblity

382
00:22:55,762 --> 00:23:02,315
That I can also keep believing. With my power...

383
00:23:02,315 --> 00:23:05,643
In the depths of the world that we must protect,

384
00:23:05,643 --> 00:23:08,997
rise up as many times as it take

385
00:23:08,997 --> 00:23:15,064
If I can't hold it with both hands, I'll lend it to you

386
00:23:15,674 --> 00:23:22,368
Even if you got shaken, face foward for the smile you wish to protect

387
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:27,294
There's a scenary I want to show you,

388
00:23:27,294 --> 00:23:29,815
let's go togehter

389
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:38,500
Next time, "Charybdis."
