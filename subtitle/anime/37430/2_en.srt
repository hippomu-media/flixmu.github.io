1
00:00:01,447 --> 00:00:06,168
Beyond a Fiction that nobody knows,

2
00:00:06,168 --> 00:00:11,523
here I open a nameless Story!

3
00:00:24,394 --> 00:00:29,030
The sky above holds a tomorrow brimming with hope

4
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:34,355
My days were vauge as I'm wondering What's the name?

5
00:00:34,355 --> 00:00:38,919
It took my far-reaching dream that kept me standing in awe

6
00:00:38,919 --> 00:00:44,079
along with my despair and consume them all away

7
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:48,534
My voice has been engraved by the shape of my wish

8
00:00:48,534 --> 00:00:53,051
Make it stronger, stronger, even stronger!

9
00:00:53,051 --> 00:00:56,205
Fly high!

10
00:00:57,906 --> 00:01:02,928
Beyond a Fiction that nobody knows,

11
00:01:02,928 --> 00:01:07,960
There's a slowly sprouting impulse of Skill to stay alive

12
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:12,823
If what I feel right now is Reality, then it will surely be a proof someday

13
00:01:12,823 --> 00:01:17,742
Each one of your story, I shall give a name to it

14
00:01:17,742 --> 00:01:23,053
to the east, to the west, to the high stand up to the period!

15
00:01:23,053 --> 00:01:25,645
Let's go!

16
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:33,400
So, what do we do?

17
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,868
Hmm?

18
00:01:34,868 --> 00:01:37,700
About the Unlimited Imprisonment seal that hero put on you.

19
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:42,280
I feel bad knowing my friend's been sealed here for 300 years.

20
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:44,390
You...

21
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:47,820
Don't give me those puppy dog eyes!

22
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:50,790
It'd be one thing coming from a cute girl, but a dragon?

23
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,230
If you have a way to get me out, I'd appreciate it.

24
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,540
Th-The thing is...

25
00:01:56,540 --> 00:02:01,420
I wouldn't have lasted another 100 years before my magic ran out.

26
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:03,640
I keep losing more and more magicules...

27
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,640
So that's why this cave is so rich in magicules,

28
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,760
and there are so many valuable herbs and ore.

29
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:13,390
What happens when your magic runs out?

30
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:15,000
It's not a huge deal.

31
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,530
It's not?

32
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,280
I'll just die, that's all.

33
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:22,470
I... I see...

34
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:27,380
After all these years of isolation, you just die, huh?

35
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:30,290
Might as well try this.

36
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:37,240
Great Sage, use Predator to consume the Unlimited Imprisonment.

37
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,870
Failed.

38
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:46,100
I guess it won't be that easy.

39
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:49,100
See? It's impossible.

40
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:52,290
Isn't there anything we can do?

41
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:54,360
Examining the possibilities.

42
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:58,300
Hey! Don't just keep talking to your own skill!

43
00:02:58,300 --> 00:02:59,400
Old man...

44
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:01,820
Examination completed.

45
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:03,990
Possibilities include...

46
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:06,080
Uh-huh.

47
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,360
I see, I see.

48
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,580
It's only a possibility, but...

49
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:15,710
She says if we can analyze the Unlimited Imprisonment from both inside and out,

50
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:17,490
we might be able to remove it.

51
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:18,930
Oh?

52
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:21,590
Wait, but... I can't analyze it from the inside.

53
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:25,600
My skills are sealed along with me, so I can't use them.

54
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:28,970
If you can just give me the data, I can analyze it out here.

55
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:32,500
But that could take some time.

56
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:35,160
Are you sure you want to stay in here that long?

57
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:38,320
W-Well, not that I mind, but...

58
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,690
Good point...

59
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:43,210
Since I'm here, I'd like to search for others from my homeland.

60
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:44,920
I see...

61
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,240
So here's a suggestion.

62
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:49,750
A suggestion?

63
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:53,500
Want to get in my stomach?

64
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:07,300
I'll use my skills, Great Sage and Predator, to analyze Unlimited Imprisonment

65
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:09,810
while you try to destroy it from the inside.

66
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:13,860
You'll be quarantined in my stomach, so you won't disappear.

67
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:15,310
What do you say?

68
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:30,030
That sounds interesting! Please, do it!

69
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:32,710
I'll entrust my entirety to you!

70
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:35,620
Are you sure you want to believe me that easily?

71
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:37,160
Of course!

72
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:40,060
It sounds more fun to break through Unlimited Imprisonment together

73
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:43,300
than to wait here alone until you come back!

74
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:45,040
Right...

75
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,490
Better two than one...

76
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:49,310
Sounds great!

77
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,550
Yes!

78
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,160
O-Okay, I'll use Predator to—

79
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,740
W-Wait a moment!

80
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:01,420
Before we start, I'll give you a name.

81
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:04,150
You can give me one, too.

82
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:05,300
Huh?

83
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:08,910
It will engrave onto our souls the fact that we are equals.

84
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:12,090
It'll be what humans call a "family name,"

85
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:15,580
but the name I give you will grant you divine protection.

86
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:20,120
You are still nameless, so you'll become a monster with a name.

87
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:22,720
A monster with a name, huh?

88
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,840
That sounds good!

89
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:25,390
Doesn't it?

90
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,870
Give me a cool name!

91
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:29,090
Same to you!

92
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,640
A cool name...

93
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,150
Let's see...

94
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:35,500
The Storm Dragon, Veldora...

95
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:37,640
Storm, huh?

96
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:41,900
And... what's another word for a storm, again?

97
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,530
Storm... sounds kinda weird.

98
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:46,780
Tempest!

99
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,320
What do you think of "Tempest"?

100
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:51,960
What?!

101
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:54,080
Tempest, you say?!

102
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,040
D-Don't like it?

103
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:58,650
It sounds fantastic!

104
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:02,210
As of today, I am Veldora Tempest!

105
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:05,340
Y-You like it?

106
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:09,620
And I will grant you the name "Rimuru."

107
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:10,890
Rimuru...

108
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:12,350
Not bad.

109
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,350
You will be Rimuru Tempest!

110
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:23,900
At that moment, something changed deep in my soul.

111
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,900
The name "Rimuru Tempest" had become engraved upon it.

112
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:33,160
I am... Rimuru Tempest.

113
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:34,910
Rimuru...

114
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:37,230
Veldora Tempest...

115
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:43,720
Okay, I'm going to eat you now.

116
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:46,670
Break out of that Unlimited Imprisonment already!

117
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,370
Leave it to me.

118
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:52,180
I will see you face-to-face in no time!

119
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,300
All right!

120
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,930
Unique skill: Predator!

121
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,840
That ended far too soon.

122
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,660
I was just talking with him a moment ago...

123
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:19,660
Would you like to analyze the unique skill Unlimited Imprisonment?

124
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:22,390
Yes. Please do it.

125
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:26,570
A great tremor rocked the world on this day.

126
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:29,500
The disappearance of the Storm Dragon Veldora,

127
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,950
a Catastrophe-class monster, was confirmed.

128
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:37,900
The cave where Veldora had been sealed was in the Great Forest of Jura.

129
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:42,690
In the area of the Great Forest of Jura are several countries.

130
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:49,930
In one of them, the Kingdom of Blumund...

131
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,120
You've heard about the Storm Dragon Veldora, yes?

132
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:58,220
Of course I have.

133
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:02,370
I should have expected as much of a Guildmaster.

134
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:06,760
So, can you tell me what measures the guild intends to take?

135
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:09,880
We have no plans to take any particular action.

136
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:15,140
The disappearance of Veldora is predicted to galvanize the monsters!

137
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:22,190
There is a chance that the Eastern Kingdom will advance through the

138
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:25,150
previously impassable region that the Storm Dragon was sealed in.

139
00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:27,390
If they get through that forest,

140
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:29,650
the provinces surrounding the Great Forest of Jura

141
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:33,400
will fall under the empire's rule, in the blink of an eye.

142
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:41,160
You look tired. Are you getting enough sleep?

143
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:46,090
As a favor to an old friend,

144
00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:48,700
I'll conduct an investigation personally.

145
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:52,670
I'll look into the state of the Great Forest of Jura and the kingdom's movements.

146
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,180
Thank you. Please see to it.

147
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:03,070
The chaos in the surrounding countries since noticing

148
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:06,390
that Veldora disappeared was like a disturbed hornet's nest.

149
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:09,630
Of course, Rimuru had no way to know this.

150
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:13,570
How many days has it been since I ate Veldora?

151
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,460
I wandered around everywhere, trying to get out of the cave.

152
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:20,520
I gobbled up all the herbs and ores I came across

153
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:22,580
to store them in my body.

154
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:30,500
Skill: Water Movement acquired.

155
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:37,720
Skill: Water Blade acquired.

156
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:42,930
The acquired skills Water Pressure Propulsion, Water Movement, and Water Blade

157
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:47,730
combine to evolve into extra skill, Water Manipulation.

158
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:52,820
I tried out lots of things and gained some new skills.

159
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:56,070
And then... I found the one!

160
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,540
The one bound to me by the red thread of fate!

161
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:00,570
Except it wasn't.

162
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:06,820
This looks bad. I doubt it's gonna let me escape.

163
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:12,710
But wait... This is nothing compared to Veldora, is it?

164
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:15,840
Maybe it's not as scary as I thought.

165
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:17,050
I can do it!

166
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:21,970
Water Blade!

167
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,650
That's a much stronger technique than I expected.

168
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,570
I'll have to be careful who I use it on...

169
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:35,590
Wait...

170
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,710
If I use Predator to eat this snake and analyze it,

171
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:42,910
wouldn't I be able to take its abilities?

172
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:46,330
Right! Eat it whole!

173
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:55,390
Blech!

174
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:58,090
I can't taste things, but still! Blech!

175
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:00,300
Analysis complete.

176
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:04,500
Skills: Poisonous Breath and Sense Heat Source acquired.

177
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:07,560
You can now mimic Black Serpent.

178
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:11,760
So I can breathe poison and sense heat sources?

179
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,900
That could come in pretty handy.

180
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:16,780
Man, Predator sure is useful!

181
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,290
All right! I'm gonna acquire a lot more skills!

182
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:33,040
Take this!

183
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:45,180
I'd better not use Poisonous Breath anymore...

184
00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:01,190
Water Blade! Water Blade! Water Blade! Water Blade!

185
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:22,830
A red water strider, A-I-U-E-O!

186
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:24,070
Little shrimp swim in the algae!

187
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:27,050
Using the organ that the bat used for its Ultrasonic Wave,

188
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:29,020
I was finally able to speak.

189
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:32,560
We are aliens.

190
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:44,870
Then, after several weeks of wandering around that cave...

191
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:46,330
At last...

192
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:52,950
This is probably the exit, right?

193
00:12:53,810 --> 00:12:55,540
Well, now what?

194
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:57,940
Can I cut it up with Water Blade?

195
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,740
It finally opened.

196
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:21,940
It's so rusty, the keyhole's falling apart.

197
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:23,660
That's no surprise.

198
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:26,740
Nobody's come in here for 300 years.

199
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:29,240
We won't be attacked out of nowhere, right?

200
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,500
Of course, if it comes to it, we can always use Escape...

201
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:38,040
The first humans I've seen...

202
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:42,000
I don't know what they're here for, but I guess they're adventurers?

203
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:44,260
Wait, I can understand them!

204
00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:45,510
Answer.

205
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:51,010
The use of Magic Sense turns sound waves that carry intention into comprehensible words.

206
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:53,430
So that's why. Thank goodness!

207
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:55,900
I was never good at English.

208
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:59,280
And by producing sound waves that carry your thoughts, you can converse.

209
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,540
Oh!

210
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:03,530
But I'm a slime now.

211
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:07,030
It would suck if I talked to them and they immediately attacked me.

212
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:10,280
All right, I'm gonna activate my Stealth Arts.

213
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:24,830
He called that skill "Stealth"? You could peep all you wanted with that.

214
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:26,350
What a disgraceful creep!

215
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:28,590
I'll have to make friends with him later!

216
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:32,880
Are they gone?

217
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:39,970
What is it?

218
00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:43,050
I thought I sensed a monster...

219
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:44,860
Was it my imagination?

220
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:48,400
So I left the cave.

221
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:51,670
How long has it been since I walked in the sunlight?

222
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:54,870
There's been no sign of Veldora since then.

223
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:59,460
It seems like he vanished for good, but I know that's not true.

224
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:02,650
I promised, after all.

225
00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:16,200
I'll have to build up a lot of funny stories to tell him about next time we meet.

226
00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:19,880
Ah, I haven't seen the outside in so long!

227
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,400
The air tastes so sweet!

228
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,520
Not that I can taste.

229
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:30,530
Hey, Veldora...

230
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:35,030
It looks like I'm about to have one funny story to tell you about already.

231
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:37,040
Scrawny bodies,

232
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:38,790
beat-up weapons...

233
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:44,790
Strong one, do you have business here?

234
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:46,550
Strong one?

235
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:49,060
Wait, me?

236
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,430
I just need to produce sound waves carrying my thoughts?

237
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:53,260
Okay!

238
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:57,430
Right, so, hello!

239
00:15:57,430 --> 00:16:01,430
I'm a slime, and my name is Rimuru!

240
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:06,330
We're well aware of how strong you are, sir!

241
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:08,990
Please, quiet your voice!

242
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:11,440
Maybe I thought too hard...

243
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,700
So, did you need something?

244
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:16,800
We sensed a powerful monster,

245
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,580
so we came here as a precaution.

246
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,520
I don't sense anything like that.

247
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:23,790
Surely you jest!

248
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:28,000
Even if you face us in that form, we won't be fooled!

249
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,960
I guess he really does mean me.

250
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:34,840
Strong one, having seen your power, we wish to ask a favor.

251
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,350
Then I was led to the Goblin Village.

252
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:43,210
It sure is a shoddy village, though.

253
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:45,600
I bet Veldora could blow it away with one snort.

254
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,860
Welcome, visitor.

255
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:52,860
I am the elder of this village.

256
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:55,400
Hi, nice to meet you.

257
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:58,120
So, what favor did you want to ask of me?

258
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:05,310
Have you noticed that monsters have been unusually active of late?

259
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:06,370
No...

260
00:17:06,370 --> 00:17:11,860
Our god disappeared one month ago.

261
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:17,040
As a result, monsters in the area have been continually harassing us.

262
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:20,250
Their god? Does he mean Veldora?

263
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:22,020
The timing fits.

264
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:25,140
I guess he was keeping monsters away?

265
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:29,480
We tried to fight them, but we lack the numbers...

266
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,650
S-So we hoped you would...

267
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:34,530
...help you out, huh?

268
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:37,050
But I'm just a slime.

269
00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:40,410
I doubt I can do all the things you expect of me.

270
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,450
Please, don't be modest.

271
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:43,660
Don't be modest.

272
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:48,510
A mere slime would not emit such an intense aura.

273
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:51,920
You are quite a famous monster, are you not?

274
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:53,560
Aura?

275
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:56,740
What's he talking about? I don't have one of those.

276
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:00,600
Great Sage, change Magic Sense's perspective

277
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,680
and let me look at myself.

278
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,470
Changing perspective.

279
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:11,480
Whoa! I've been emitting an aura this whole time!

280
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:14,980
I feel like I've been walking down a major street with my fly open!

281
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:16,510
This is bad!

282
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:19,110
So that's why the Goblins were scared of me!

283
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:23,620
Leave it to the elder to notice.

284
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:28,710
But of course. You cannot hide the formidable air about you.

285
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:29,610
I see...

286
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:31,510
So you figured it out.

287
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:34,480
You guys show a lot of potential.

288
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,920
Oh, I sucked it in.

289
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:41,440
Ah... Have you been testing us?

290
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:45,850
It's fortunate that so many of us were frightened by your aura.

291
00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:47,510
Y-Yeah, that's right!

292
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:50,650
You've got potential if you can talk to me without fear!

293
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,520
What potential?!

294
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:55,980
Come to think of it, how did those humans in the cave not see my aura?

295
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:57,280
Are those guys okay?

296
00:18:57,450 --> 00:18:59,460
Thank you so much.

297
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:02,780
Ah, as for the favor we wish to ask...

298
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,940
According to the Goblins,

299
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:10,580
wolf monsters, Direwolves, attacked them from the east,

300
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:14,090
and many Goblins died in the ensuing battle.

301
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:18,920
Apparently, Direwolves are so much more powerful than Goblins that

302
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:21,720
it takes ten Goblins to even have a chance at beating one Direwolf.

303
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:26,430
And there was one warrior among them with a name, who served as their guardian.

304
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:32,460
Even that warrior was killed, leaving the village in peril.

305
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:36,440
There are about 100 Direwolves in total.

306
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:39,260
How many do we have?

307
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:43,200
Including females, we have about 60 who can fight.

308
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,520
That's a pretty devastating difference in strength.

309
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,450
It's like an impossible video game.

310
00:19:47,930 --> 00:19:52,840
So did that Goblin warrior fight them knowing he couldn't win?

311
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:55,630
No... That warrior gave his life just retrieving

312
00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:59,340
information on the Direwolves for us.

313
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:06,570
The warrior was my son, and his elder brother.

314
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:10,430
I see...

315
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:12,260
Forgive me for asking that.

316
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,760
Elder, tell me one thing.

317
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,030
Y-Yes?

318
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:25,670
What will I get in return for helping this village?

319
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:28,530
What can you guys give me?

320
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:37,030
I'm not actually looking for compensation.

321
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:40,210
I just need to put on a bit of a show.

322
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:44,220
W-We will offer you our loyalty!

323
00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:46,990
Please grant us your protection!

324
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:51,050
If you do, we will swear our loyalty to you!

325
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:52,230
We will swear!

326
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:55,980
This looks familiar.

327
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:59,220
Senpai! Just this once, please!

328
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:01,230
Oh, all right.

329
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:05,780
When all is said and done, I just can't say no.

330
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,200
Th-The Direwolves!

331
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,050
This is terrible!

332
00:21:15,050 --> 00:21:15,960
We're done for!

333
00:21:16,170 --> 00:21:18,460
We'll all be eaten!

334
00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:19,810
Let's run!

335
00:21:19,810 --> 00:21:21,290
B-But where?

336
00:21:21,290 --> 00:21:24,400
E-Everyone, please calm down.

337
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,090
There's no need to fear.

338
00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:29,720
We're going to defeat them.

339
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:31,970
Y-You mean...

340
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:43,290
In lieu of the Storm Dragon Veldora,

341
00:21:43,290 --> 00:21:46,240
I, Rimuru Tempest, will grant your wish!

342
00:21:49,290 --> 00:21:51,040
Thank you so much!

343
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:56,120
We are your loyal servants, great Rimuru!

344
00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:57,880
You can count on me.

345
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:02,560
And that's how I became the Goblins' leader,

346
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:04,570
their guardian.

347
00:22:18,044 --> 00:22:23,824
Why is it only those who have hope

348
00:22:23,824 --> 00:22:29,321
To fall into despair from the bottom of their heart?

349
00:22:29,321 --> 00:22:34,245
Why is it only those who have courage

350
00:22:34,245 --> 00:22:40,187
To be wounded at the end of their honor?

351
00:22:40,187 --> 00:22:45,904
I don't want to close my eyes in face of sadness

352
00:22:45,904 --> 00:22:51,533
The dawn for new tomorrow was a mere dream to me

353
00:22:51,533 --> 00:22:57,305
Then I see a light falling through the crack of the night

354
00:22:57,305 --> 00:23:03,756
The sky is crying

355
00:23:04,261 --> 00:23:09,825
I don't know what is there at the corner of the world

356
00:23:09,825 --> 00:23:15,441
All I want is to protect those within my reach

357
00:23:15,441 --> 00:23:21,660
Staring at the only reason to fight

358
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:28,846
We who believe the answer to be forgiveness...

359
00:23:28,846 --> 00:23:33,600
Must not lose!

360
00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:39,770
Next time, "Battle at the Goblin Village."
