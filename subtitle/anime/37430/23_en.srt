1
00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:03,640
In hopes of saving the kids,

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:06,200
Rimuru took them in search of the Dwelling of Spirits.

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:08,700
On the way, they met Ramiris, the Queen of Spirits.

4
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:11,910
Then, after earning her agreement to help,

5
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:14,700
they set out to try to summon superior spirits.

6
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:18,710
So this is...

7
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:22,700
The deepest part of the Labyrinth, the Dwelling of Spirits.

8
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:28,040
Kenya, Ryota, Gale, Alice, Chloe...

9
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:29,800
-Let's do this! -Yeah!

10
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,190
Shizu-san, wherever you are, are you watching?

11
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:38,700
I'll make sure

12
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:41,380
your wish is realized.

13
00:00:52,454 --> 00:00:58,021
In the night you could count stars in the sky

14
00:00:58,021 --> 00:01:03,519
The overflown drop reflects the swaying world

15
00:01:03,519 --> 00:01:09,416
All life are in ambivalence

16
00:01:09,416 --> 00:01:14,212
And it twinkles as the days goes by

17
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:20,804
Both short-lived flowers and devastating winds

18
00:01:20,804 --> 00:01:25,056
are the sign of the passing present

19
00:01:25,851 --> 00:01:31,842
To those who live in the moment, this song shall reach you

20
00:01:31,842 --> 00:01:39,932
It will push you to the limits of freedom, telling you to survive

21
00:01:39,932 --> 00:01:42,707
We will find the way

22
00:01:42,707 --> 00:01:51,040
We returners all equally carry a seed of hope

23
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:57,543
Under the whim of miracle, Birth and Demise shall join hand

24
00:01:57,543 --> 00:02:01,602
and the time will flow once again

25
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:22,900
Now, listen. You'll call to the spirits from over there.

26
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:23,954
What do we say?

27
00:02:23,954 --> 00:02:28,000
Anything. It can be, "Help me!" Or even, "Let's play!"

28
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:31,750
If any spirits take interest and come to you, the summon was a success.

29
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,430
Will they actually come?

30
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:36,360
Sure they will!

31
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,420
R-Right...

32
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:39,530
Sensei, they'll come, right?

33
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:40,930
They'll come?

34
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:44,010
It'll be fine. In the worst case...

35
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:46,670
I'll tame a demon if I have to.

36
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:48,680
Uh, your face looks really evil right now.

37
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,900
So, who's going first?

38
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:54,650
Sensei...

39
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:58,500
If anything happens to me, take care of them.

40
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:06,200
I can't wait to see what kind of spirit shows up!

41
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,850
Okay, I'm going to pray now.

42
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:42,450
These aren't superior spirits... They're inferior spirits.

43
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:45,650
If these tiny spirits

44
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:49,330
are fragments cut from a great spirit by Gale's prayer,

45
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:52,170
then we just need to create a new spirit.

46
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:53,460
Great Sage.

47
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:55,100
Question.

48
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:58,980
Use Gluttony to consume and unify the spirits?

49
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:01,270
That's a yes, of course.

50
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:03,820
Gale, keep praying.

51
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:11,550
H-Hey!

52
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:14,070
You ate them?! How could you do that?!

53
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:16,440
Keep quiet and watch. I have an idea.

54
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,570
Go for it, Great Sage.

55
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:19,650
Notice.

56
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:21,780
Using the unique skill Degenerate,

57
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:24,830
unification into a superior spirit is complete.

58
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:25,710
All right!

59
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:27,440
Its attribute is earth.

60
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,580
Creating auxiliary artificial personality.

61
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:31,110
Success.

62
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:35,980
Unify the completed artificial superior spirit of earth with Gale Gibson?

63
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:36,830
Yes!

64
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:45,930
How's this? Appraisal.

65
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:51,090
His rampant energy is calming down.

66
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:53,319
He's got control.

67
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,280
Now, as his body matures,

68
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:58,920
he should gradually acquire abilities.

69
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:01,480
We did it, Great Sage!

70
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,490
Heh.

71
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:06,110
I feel like I just saw Great Sage make a smug face...

72
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:07,080
You imagined it.

73
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:10,910
Okay, it's over. You did great.

74
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:12,090
Huh?

75
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:15,790
You're okay now. The destruction's stopped.

76
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:16,670
I guarantee it.

77
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:20,790
S-Sensei... Thank you so much!

78
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:24,800
Think nothing of it. It's only natural that I'd protect my students.

79
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:27,280
Hooray!

80
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,720
-Congratulations! -You did it!

81
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:30,390
That's great!

82
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,720
It's too soon to celebrate.

83
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,140
Save the parties for after you're all successful.

84
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:49,651
Notice.

85
00:05:49,651 --> 00:05:51,810
Using the unique skill Degenerate,

86
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:55,000
unification into a superior spirit is complete.

87
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Its attribute is space.

88
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:02,880
Unify the completed artificial superior spirit of space with Alice Rondo?

89
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:03,962
Yes.

90
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,210
Alice, you did great.

91
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:12,510
You'll be okay now.

92
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:15,890
Well, thanks!

93
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,520
All right! I'm next!

94
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:27,940
I haven't even started praying yet...

95
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:32,017
Is something coming?

96
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,640
Hey! How are ya?

97
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,210
I'm just great!

98
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:43,200
What the heck are you doing in my house?!

99
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,000
It was just a whim.

100
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,670
Who is that?

101
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:47,420
This is...

102
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:50,880
Hiya! I'm a light spirit! Nice to meet ya!

103
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,700
Unlike the evil spirit that fell to become this monster

104
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:55,760
I'm a pure, innocent spirit of light!

105
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,970
Who are you calling evil?!

106
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:01,780
Kenya, it looks like you summoned a superior spirit of light.

107
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:03,310
Wh-What?!

108
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:06,800
So your name's Kenya? Okay, I'm gonna call you Ken!

109
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,710
I could just feel something shining in you, Ken!

110
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:11,450
I know, 'cause I'm light!

111
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:13,740
That wasn't funny.

112
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:17,630
So on that note, I'm gonna save you, Ken!

113
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:20,870
I'll look out for you until you're all grown up!

114
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:24,750
You might even become a Hero, you know!

115
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:26,250
A Hero?!

116
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:27,960
Ken, a Hero?

117
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:28,760
Wow...

118
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:31,020
Well, that would be something...

119
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:35,780
It inhabited you...

120
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:36,490
Huh?

121
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:37,990
That easily?

122
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:40,026
Sensei...

123
00:07:40,026 --> 00:07:41,436
Huh?

124
00:07:41,436 --> 00:07:44,410
Oh, yeah! It's fine! All according to plan!

125
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:46,750
Good for you!

126
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:48,740
Er, uh...

127
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:50,410
Yeah!

128
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:56,470
Notice.

129
00:07:56,470 --> 00:07:58,570
Its attributes are water and wind.

130
00:07:58,570 --> 00:08:02,330
Creation of artificial superior spirit of water and wind successful.

131
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:04,920
Unify it with Ryota Sekiguchi?

132
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:05,960
Yes.

133
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,750
Just one left.

134
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:19,430
Sensei, um... Sensei...

135
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:27,190
Um, Sensei... um...

136
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:31,070
I love you!

137
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:32,950
Well, I like you, too.

138
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:39,030
I wish you'd waited another eight... no, ten years to say that.

139
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,480
Hell, I wish I'd heard that while I was alive!

140
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:45,090
Go on and pray.

141
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:45,910
Okay.

142
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:52,880
What's that?

143
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:01,390
That pressure... It felt like the sky fell down.

144
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,467
That's... not a spirit?

145
00:09:16,467 --> 00:09:17,440
Answer.

146
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,510
It is a spiritual body equivalent to a superior spirit.

147
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:22,870
Abnormal level of energy detected.

148
00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:25,410
Its threshold is immeasurable.

149
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:40,800
What the...

150
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:45,580
Hold it! No way, no how!

151
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:47,488
I'm not letting you have your way!

152
00:09:47,488 --> 00:09:48,460
Hey, what the heck are you—

153
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:51,849
Quiet! That thing's dangerous! Can't you see that?!

154
00:09:51,849 --> 00:09:54,320
How the hell would I know?! What's so dangerous?

155
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,520
We'll talk later!

156
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:06,460
It inhabited her!

157
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:08,080
Darn it! It's too late!

158
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:11,020
Well, I'm done! Don't blame me for whatever happens!

159
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,420
Appraisal.

160
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:18,930
That immense energy has completely disappeared.

161
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:22,050
She seems... stable.

162
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:24,430
Looks like there's no problem...

163
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:27,230
But what in the world...

164
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:31,920
So just what was that?

165
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,910
No idea! I don't know the details!

166
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:37,860
But I'm pretty sure that one was born in the future.

167
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:38,624
Huh?

168
00:10:38,624 --> 00:10:41,700
It's something resembling a spirit, except it came from the future!

169
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:43,600
It's almost impossible to believe,

170
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,360
but by inhabiting her, it laid the foundation for its own rebirth?

171
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,700
What are you talking about?

172
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:52,190
I seriously don't know!

173
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:54,730
But that thing had enormous power!

174
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:58,340
I'm pretty sure it'll be big trouble if that thing is born in the future!

175
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:01,720
Maybe it had the divine protection of the Great Spirit of Time...

176
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:03,700
I'm completely lost!

177
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:08,820
But it's all good. As long as Chloe's okay, that's all that matters.

178
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:12,580
No one knows what'll happen in the future, so it means nothing right now!

179
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:19,680
Good for you, Chloe. It went just as I planned.

180
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,820
You're out of danger now, too.

181
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:25,570
Was that really just as you planned it?

182
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:28,500
Y-Yeah! Of course!

183
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,660
I mean, not that it matters.

184
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:37,230
Now that it's inhabited her, it's out of my control.

185
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:40,420
What's the problem? Everyone was successful.

186
00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:44,430
Thanks! These kids are saved, thanks to you!

187
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:46,010
Thank you!

188
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:48,490
Thank you!

189
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:49,430
I'm grateful!

190
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:53,440
C-Cut that out already!

191
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:57,860
And this is a Demon Lord? What has the world come to?

192
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:16,380
I did it, Shizu-san.

193
00:12:16,890 --> 00:12:18,720
They'll be okay now.

194
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:23,440
It was a happy ending!

195
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,270
Or so I thought, but after that...

196
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:30,520
I had to give Ramiris a replacement for the golem I destroyed...

197
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:39,460
Then I had to summon a demon and make it possess that golem...

198
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:42,070
And there was one last struggle.

199
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:45,450
But hey, that's a different story.

200
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:50,290
I truly thank you.

201
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:53,540
Nah, no worries, no worries!

202
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:56,020
The kids will be fine now.

203
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:58,840
Guess they'll be able to live normal lives, huh?

204
00:12:58,840 --> 00:12:59,910
Yes.

205
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:03,420
It's unlikely the nations that abandoned them will ever try to take them back.

206
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:06,960
That would violate international law, anyway.

207
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:10,560
They'd be making enemies of the Free Union if they did that.

208
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:14,810
Are you going to give the kids IDs and make them members of the Union?

209
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:20,570
Well, if that's what they want, that might be a very good idea.

210
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:24,940
But for the time being, I'd like to let them study at the Freedom Academy

211
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:27,400
and give them the chance to choose their future.

212
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,070
Okay. I'm counting on you.

213
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:30,890
You needn't worry.

214
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:36,830
By the way, you still won't tell me how you resolved all this?

215
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,090
That's a secret.

216
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:41,240
There are some things you don't need to know.

217
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:44,570
It's no substitute for telling you,

218
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:47,720
but I hope you'll be content with this...

219
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:53,220
Understood! Thank you, Master!

220
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:02,160
Hey, wait up!

221
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:15,160
So much has happened...

222
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:22,420
But now this case is closed.

223
00:17:22,850 --> 00:17:24,950
All of our problems have been solved.

224
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:29,750
Shizu-san, this is for the best, right?

225
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:39,280
Thank you, Slime-san.

226
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,970
What a horrible blunder.

227
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:22,070
You finally summoned me,

228
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:25,220
and my own family got ahead of me.

229
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:29,820
Next time, without a doubt...

230
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:36,980
I know you will lead me to the truth of this world.

231
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:50,000
Sensei... Sensei, don't go...

232
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:54,140
Chlo-chi... Don't try to keep Sensei here.

233
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:56,910
Yeah! Just get going already!

234
00:19:56,910 --> 00:19:57,750
But...

235
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,010
Take care of them.

236
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:08,600
I will. You can count on me.

237
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:15,190
Sensei!

238
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:25,170
Jeez, Chloe, you're such a crybaby.

239
00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:26,320
Stop crying!

240
00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:27,990
You're crying, too, Ken-chan...

241
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:29,990
I'm not! My eyes are just sweating!

242
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:32,750
Sensei... Sensei...

243
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:37,880
Chloe.

244
00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:40,250
There, there, Chloe.

245
00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:43,050
I'll give you this, so cheer up, okay?

246
00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:46,510
I wanted that, too!

247
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:48,640
But I got it.

248
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,320
Lucky!

249
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,850
No fair! No fair!

250
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:54,680
Oh, right. I have gifts for you guys, too.

251
00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:02,430
Ken-chan, you look awesome!

252
00:21:02,430 --> 00:21:03,940
So do you!

253
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:05,360
These are fantastic!

254
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:07,870
I-It's so cute!

255
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:11,470
There's a really handy girl named Shuna in my country.

256
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:13,370
I had her make those and send them.

257
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:14,530
Sensei...

258
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:15,850
Thank you!

259
00:21:15,850 --> 00:21:18,380
Now, listen. Be sure you study hard.

260
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:22,810
Saying goodbye is sad, but it's not as if we'll never meet again.

261
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:26,600
I'll bring Ranga and come visit you.

262
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:30,510
Be sure to keep up with your studies, even after we leave!

263
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:33,480
Y-You'd better come visit us!

264
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:37,770
Wh-When I graduate, I might just come visit you, too!

265
00:21:38,010 --> 00:21:39,760
Sure. I'll be waiting.

266
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:43,090
I'll have the entire city of Rimuru welcome you.

267
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:49,370
Sensei!

268
00:21:49,370 --> 00:21:50,290
See you again!

269
00:21:50,290 --> 00:21:52,040
-Take care! -Goodbye!

270
00:21:52,810 --> 00:21:54,540
Be well!

271
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:01,610
See you again.

272
00:22:06,390 --> 00:22:09,890
Master, why did you give her your treasured mask?

273
00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:13,390
Yeah, I wonder why, too...

274
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,300
I'm not sure either,

275
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:22,680
but for some reason, giving it to Chloe felt like the natural thing to do.

276
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:25,150
Something told me that was best.

277
00:22:25,810 --> 00:22:27,150
I see.

278
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:32,530
I bet Shizu-san would be happier with Chloe having it than me.

279
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:35,790
She'll take good care of it.

280
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:38,320
She might even follow in Shizu-san's footsteps to become a champion...

281
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:41,450
Heck, she might even become a Hero!

282
00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:42,040
Surely not!

283
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:46,060
Ranga!

284
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:47,750
Yes, Master!

285
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:51,230
Let's go back to our town... to our home!

286
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:52,570
Everyone's waiting!

287
00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:08,150
The man who thought he was living a perfectly ordinary life

288
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:10,640
was stabbed by a random attacker and died,

289
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,860
and was reincarnated in another world.

290
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,470
He took in the Storm Dragon Veldora

291
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:19,480
as well as the will and body of a certain girl,

292
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:21,540
overcame many crises,

293
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:23,710
brought together many races of monsters,

294
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:26,760
built a nation, and saved a group of children.

295
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:31,000
His name is Rimuru Tempest,

296
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,280
and he is but a slime.

297
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:39,350
Next time, "Extra: Black and a Mask."
