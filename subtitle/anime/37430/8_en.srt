1
00:00:00,447 --> 00:00:05,168
Beyond a Fiction that nobody knows,

2
00:00:05,168 --> 00:00:10,523
here I open a nameless Story!

3
00:00:23,394 --> 00:00:28,030
The sky above holds a tomorrow brimming with hope

4
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:33,355
My days were vauge as I'm wondering What's the name?

5
00:00:33,355 --> 00:00:37,919
It took my far-reaching dream that kept me standing in awe

6
00:00:37,919 --> 00:00:43,079
along with my despair and consume them all away

7
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:47,534
My voice has been engraved by the shape of my wish

8
00:00:47,534 --> 00:00:52,051
Make it stronger, stronger, even stronger!

9
00:00:52,051 --> 00:00:55,205
Fly high!

10
00:00:56,906 --> 00:01:01,928
Beyond a Fiction that nobody knows,

11
00:01:01,928 --> 00:01:06,960
There's a slowly sprouting impulse of Skill to stay alive

12
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:11,823
If what I feel right now is Reality, then it will surely be a proof someday

13
00:01:11,823 --> 00:01:16,742
Each one of your story, I shall give a name to it

14
00:01:16,742 --> 00:01:22,053
to the east, to the west, to the high stand up to the period!

15
00:01:22,053 --> 00:01:24,645
Let's go!

16
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:33,520
Slime-san...

17
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:38,580
Thank you.

18
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:43,680
I nearly...

19
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:48,820
killed someone I cared about again.

20
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:51,730
With my own hands...

21
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:57,130
Hey, Slime-san...

22
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,090
Would you mind listening?

23
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,700
You shouldn't talk too much...

24
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:11,920
I want people to remember my story... and know that I lived.

25
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:14,120
All right.

26
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:22,190
So Shizu-san told me what happened, though her recollection was vague.

27
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:26,970
She spoke of how Ifrit possessed her after she was summoned,

28
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,330
and how she ended up killing her friend...

29
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:32,560
And...

30
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,150
After Pirino died,

31
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:42,180
I continued to serve the Demon Lord as his closest aide.

32
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,060
But then I met...

33
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:47,900
Met who?

34
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:50,670
The Hero.

35
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,170
Hero?

36
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,710
Yes... The Hero.

37
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,630
There was a battle,

38
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:02,870
and the Demon Lord abandoned his castle,

39
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,660
leaving me behind as the rear guard.

40
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,160
Was it the will of the fire spirit Ifrit,

41
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,170
or was it of my own volition?

42
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:15,470
I'm still not sure.

43
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:34,200
I can't beat her...

44
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:38,810
The Hero, huh?

45
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:43,610
I don't suppose it was the same one who sealed Veldora...

46
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:47,210
I thought I'd be killed instantly...

47
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:51,450
But then she spoke to me.

48
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,760
She asked me why I was there,

49
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,060
how I had stayed alive...

50
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:03,880
I was a majin, and she believed everything I said.

51
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,560
She told me, "It's all right now."

52
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:13,580
My emotions came back to me.

53
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:17,420
Then the Hero took me in...

54
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:22,460
She was the one who gave me that mask.

55
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:25,860
She said it would boost my magic resistance

56
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:29,690
and help suppress Ifrit, the spirit dwelling within me.

57
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:31,630
Hang on a sec.

58
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:40,630
By traveling with her,

59
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:45,980
I learned about this world, and I learned magic.

60
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:53,140
Through the power of the mask, I even learned to use Ifrit's power, to some extent.

61
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:57,920
By helping others, and fighting...

62
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:02,870
That's how you came to be known as the Conqueror of Flames.

63
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:07,340
Well, that was an awesome attack, all right! You were on fire!

64
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:15,950
I was so happy traveling with her.

65
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,514
But...

66
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:20,463
But?

67
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:24,520
Then she disappeared,

68
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:26,900
leaving me behind.

69
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,140
Why?

70
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:31,170
I don't know.

71
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,830
Why did she?

72
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:36,390
Why...

73
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:40,740
"I'm certain we'll meet again."

74
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:44,250
That's what she said to me.

75
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:54,790
I decided to become stronger.

76
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:58,420
I wanted to help people who were suffering.

77
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:05,630
I worked really hard.

78
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:07,840
For decades!

79
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,060
Doesn't that sound impressive?

80
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:11,950
Yeah, it sure does.

81
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:15,640
People started to call me a Champion...

82
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:20,120
But I wasn't young anymore.

83
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:24,810
It was becoming more difficult for me to control Ifrit.

84
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:30,800
One wrong step, and I could unleash Ifrit by mistake.

85
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:35,450
When I thought about that, I got scared.

86
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:40,480
I knew I could hurt someone I cared about again...

87
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:48,630
So I retired and became an instructor.

88
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:50,160
An instructor?

89
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,430
A teacher at a school.

90
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:54,770
Oh! There are schools here?

91
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,910
Yes, in a place called the Kingdom of Ingrassia.

92
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,310
It was a school for kids from other worlds.

93
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:03,920
Kids? So there must be quite a few people

94
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:06,900
who came here from another world, huh?

95
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:13,780
It was one of them who taught me that video game line you quoted.

96
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:17,450
"I'm not a bad slime!"

97
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:23,990
It was so much fun.

98
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:29,590
What're we gonna do today, Sensei?

99
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:33,220
That's a good question. What should we do today?

100
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:36,780
Those days were so peaceful.

101
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:46,090
Some of them eventually went off on their own and left me...

102
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:51,600
But one of them went on to become the Grandmaster.

103
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,070
Grandmaster?

104
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:57,190
The one responsible for overseeing all the guilds in every country.

105
00:07:57,190 --> 00:07:59,580
That sounds like a big deal!

106
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,860
Yes, it is.

107
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,820
So I thought there was nothing left that I could teach anyone.

108
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:10,700
And then, possibly because I'm nearing the end of my life,

109
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:13,890
it became more difficult to suppress Ifrit's will.

110
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:19,520
There was only one thing I could remember,

111
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:22,240
so I decided to go on a journey.

112
00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:24,230
What did you remember?

113
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:29,200
My search for the man who summoned me.

114
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:32,160
Do you want revenge?

115
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:36,620
I don't know... but...

116
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:40,780
There was something I wanted to find out from him.

117
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:43,790
That's why I...

118
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:49,730
They were such nice people.

119
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:52,170
A little danger-prone, though.

120
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:54,560
That's true.

121
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,400
It was so much fun...

122
00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:00,600
But now...

123
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:09,830
Hey, Slime-san, what's your name?

124
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:12,310
Huh? I told you, I'm Rimuru.

125
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:15,570
No, I mean your real name.

126
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:16,860
Oh...

127
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:21,080
It's Satoru. Mikami Satoru.

128
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:25,950
I'm Shizue. Izawa Shizue.

129
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:33,310
Shizue-san, you should sleep now.

130
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:37,900
Satoru-san, I'd like to ask a favor.

131
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:39,590
May I?

132
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:42,670
Of course. Ask me anything.

133
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,410
Please...

134
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:49,810
eat me.

135
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:58,930
Just like you ate the curse that had been cast on me.

136
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:01,840
That made me so happy.

137
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:08,790
I dislike this world...

138
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:12,730
Still, I can't abhor it.

139
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,740
Just like that man...

140
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:20,020
So... That's why...

141
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:24,790
I don't want to be absorbed by this world.

142
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:29,350
This is... my last request.

143
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:38,360
Would you... let me rest inside you?

144
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:46,120
Okay.

145
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,420
What's the man's name?

146
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:55,120
Leon Cromwell.

147
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:57,290
Leon Cromwell...

148
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:01,860
One of the most powerful Demon Lords.

149
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,640
What did you want to find out from him?

150
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:18,940
I just wanted him to acknowledge that I, this human, had existed... perhaps.

151
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:30,270
And... if those kids could be saved... and returned to... their world...

152
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:37,390
I swear to you on the name of Mikami Satoru... no, Rimuru Tempest,

153
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:41,510
that I will make certain the Demon Lord Leon Cromwell hears your wishes!

154
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,800
Thank... you...

155
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:58,730
Shizu-san, my destined one...

156
00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:01,970
Rest in peace within me.

157
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:05,420
Use unique skill "Predator"?

158
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,020
Yes.

159
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:13,430
So that she can dream happy dreams forever and never have to wake from them.

160
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:30,720
There you are! Please don't leave me behind again!

161
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:55,710
Mom!

162
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:01,230
Mommy!

163
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:05,600
Mommy...

164
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:13,230
Do you think Shizu is all right?

165
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:17,380
Don't worry about a thing. Rimuru's with her.

166
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:22,730
That's right. Those potions of his are miracle workers, remember?

167
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:23,870
Yeah...

168
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:25,680
Well, what a surprise.

169
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:28,420
Are you here to visit our patient?

170
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:29,990
Are you, as well?

171
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:33,590
Yes. I was just bringing a change of clothes for Lady Shizu.

172
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:36,250
Great Rimuru, may I?

173
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:45,060
Master!

174
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:47,840
That body...

175
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:53,730
Th-That's... Rimuru?!

176
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:02,900
I see...

177
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:06,190
So Shizu passed on.

178
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:13,160
Are you really Rimuru?

179
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,990
There can be no doubt!

180
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:19,920
Did you really think I wouldn't recognize my master just because his body changed?!

181
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,680
Uh, no, I didn't mean it that way...

182
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:24,550
It's just, well...

183
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:28,490
You look a bit like a smaller Shizu.

184
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,300
It's true.

185
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,340
See?

186
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:37,970
Wow!

187
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:40,240
That's quite remarkable.

188
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,980
Did you eat Shizu?

189
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,600
The way you ate Ifrit?

190
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:50,200
It was the only burial I could give her.

191
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:54,230
I'm sorry I didn't consult you, her travel companions, first.

192
00:14:54,690 --> 00:14:55,828
Well...

193
00:14:55,828 --> 00:14:59,750
If it's what Shizu wanted, there was no other choice.

194
00:15:00,210 --> 00:15:01,800
Sorry, Eren.

195
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,880
You probably think this was unreasonable.

196
00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:07,480
No.

197
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,430
I just wish I could have said goodbye to her.

198
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:17,770
Shizu-san said she had fun traveling with you three.

199
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:21,830
Though she also said you were a bit danger-prone.

200
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:26,000
Hey! Why are you looking at me that way?!

201
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,240
Well, you know...

202
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:27,940
Yeah.

203
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:31,560
Well, what about the time you got caught in that pitfall?!

204
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:34,380
That was because Eren pushed me!

205
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:37,900
Hey! Don't blame me for that! A spider landed on me out of nowhere!

206
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:42,431
This suits them a lot better than being all sad and somber.

207
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:44,550
Right, Shizu-san?

208
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:48,550
Actually, I'd say they relied on her too much.

209
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,010
I'm still the leader!

210
00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:56,180
We appreciate all your help. We'll be on our way now.

211
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:58,360
Back to your home country?

212
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:01,240
Yeah, we need to report to the Guildmaster

213
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:04,100
about our findings, and about Shizu.

214
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:07,230
We won't say anything bad about this place.

215
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:09,860
We'll tell him about you, too, Rimuru.

216
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:13,070
If anything comes up, you can always send for us.

217
00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:15,820
Thanks. I'll do that.

218
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:23,730
There's one last favor we'd like to ask...

219
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:24,780
What is it?

220
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:28,340
Could you take your human form again?

221
00:16:29,810 --> 00:16:31,320
Sure, I suppose...

222
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:42,140
So what is it you want?

223
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:46,100
Thank you so much, Shizu!

224
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:52,490
I'll strive to be the kind of leader you won't have to worry about!

225
00:16:52,770 --> 00:16:56,280
My time adventuring with you will be my life's treasure!

226
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:58,310
Thank you!

227
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:01,470
You were like a big sister to me!

228
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:12,450
I'm glad Shizu-san's last travel companions happened to be these three.

229
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:17,790
By the way, I noticed your gear is looking rather shabby.

230
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:19,850
That's mean!

231
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:26,730
It's the scale mail I've always wanted!

232
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:29,320
Wait! What the heck is this robe?!

233
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:32,230
It's light, but sturdy... and it's so pretty!

234
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:36,570
D-Do we really deserve such fine equipment?

235
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:40,080
It's even lined with Direwolf fur!

236
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:43,730
They're parting gifts. Our artisans' best work!

237
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:45,050
Artisans?

238
00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:46,180
Yo!

239
00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:52,210
Our best work? They're actually just prototypes.

240
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,130
How do they feel?

241
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:56,300
It's all about craftsmanship.

242
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:58,720
Just speak!

243
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,640
I'll introduce you. From the right, this is Kaijin, Garm, Myrd, and Dord.

244
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,890
K-Kaijin?! Are you serious?!

245
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:09,910
The blacksmith who's world-famous for his skills?!

246
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:12,560
And Garm, Myrd and Dord...

247
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:14,730
The three Dwarf brothers?!

248
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:17,280
I'll make it my family heirloom! Thank you so much!

249
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,990
I'm so happy!

250
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:21,410
It's like a dream come true!

251
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:26,240
I guess Kaijin and his buddies are even more famous than I thought.

252
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:30,540
They're human national treasures... or is it "dwarven national treasures"?

253
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:36,150
After raising a fuss big enough to blow their sadness away,

254
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:37,930
the three of them left.

255
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:42,620
They're so strong and resilient. I should learn from them.

256
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:49,920
The girl who lost everything to the flames so long ago,

257
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:54,140
oddly enough, gained the power of fire in her travels.

258
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:59,990
She used that power to help the people,

259
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:02,620
but the flames gradually consumed her

260
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:06,400
until, eventually, she could no longer control them.

261
00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:11,320
Her name was "Shizue Izawa."

262
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:15,070
She was a Champion whose body housed Ifrit,

263
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:18,620
a high-ranked fire spirit, earning her the title "Conqueror of Flames."

264
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:37,530
I promised Shizu-san...

265
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:44,120
Before I can slug the Demon Lord Leon Cromwell who made Shizu-san cry,

266
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:46,080
I first need to gather information.

267
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:50,810
I'm a man who keeps his promises.

268
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:57,840
And that's how the man who thought he had an ordinary, uneventful life

269
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,920
and was stabbed on the street and died,

270
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:02,090
was reincarnated in another world,

271
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:08,970
where he inherited the will of both the Storm Dragon, Veldora, and a human woman,

272
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,660
giving him new purpose.

273
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:15,330
He was a slime by the name of Rimuru,

274
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:18,440
and the world was about to usher in

275
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:21,910
a turbulent, new era, with this lone slime at the center of it all.

276
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,650
Yeah, this feels much more right.

277
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:07,090
I will give you a name and some food.

278
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,620
Who are you?

279
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:17,380
I'm Gelmud. You can think of me as your father.

280
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:22,740
Would you rather die here?

281
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:31,260
Give me a name... and food.

282
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:37,440
Your name is Geld.

283
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:39,630
Geld...

284
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:46,850
One day, you will take possession of the Great Forest of Jura

285
00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:49,620
and become the Orc Disaster.

286
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:22,950
Why is it only those who have hope

287
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:28,447
To fall into despair from the bottom of their heart?

288
00:22:28,447 --> 00:22:33,371
Why is it only those who have courage

289
00:22:33,371 --> 00:22:39,313
To be wounded at the end of their honor?

290
00:22:39,313 --> 00:22:45,030
I don't want to close my eyes in face of sadness

291
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:50,659
The dawn for new tomorrow was a mere dream to me

292
00:22:50,659 --> 00:22:56,431
Then I see a light falling through the crack of the night

293
00:22:56,431 --> 00:23:02,882
The sky is crying

294
00:23:03,387 --> 00:23:08,951
I don't know what is there at the corner of the world

295
00:23:08,951 --> 00:23:14,567
All I want is to protect those within my reach

296
00:23:14,567 --> 00:23:20,786
Staring at the only reason to fight

297
00:23:20,786 --> 00:23:27,972
We who believe the answer to be forgiveness...

298
00:23:27,972 --> 00:23:32,726
Must not lose!

299
00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:38,650
Next time, "Attack of the Ogres."
