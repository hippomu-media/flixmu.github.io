1
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:07,940
You will pay...

2
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:10,690
You will pay!

3
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:13,690
That demon...

4
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:19,830
I swear you will pay for this!

5
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:22,460
Come to me.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,120
Come to me! Please!

7
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:48,960
Is it you who dares to summon me from such a lowly station?

8
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:53,450
If you'll grant my wish, I don't care if you're a demon!

9
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:56,990
You can have my soul! So, please...

10
00:00:57,250 --> 00:00:58,240
Make them...

11
00:00:58,450 --> 00:00:59,890
Make them...

12
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:03,030
Very well.

13
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:06,790
Granting your wish will give me something to do, at least.

14
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:10,610
Thank you... And my payment...

15
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:18,560
Indeed. Our contract is complete.

16
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:22,260
Your emotions tasted sublime.

17
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:25,460
For that reason, I will do you a great service.

18
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:27,520
That said,

19
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:31,650
this payment will only last three days, at most.

20
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:33,530
To make up for the rest... let's see...

21
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:36,530
I suppose I'll help myself to your prey.

22
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:42,190
Much time has passed since I came to the living world.

23
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:46,020
I shall enjoy it to the fullest.

24
00:01:59,444 --> 00:02:05,011
In the night you could count stars in the sky

25
00:02:05,011 --> 00:02:10,509
The overflown drop reflects the swaying world

26
00:02:10,509 --> 00:02:16,406
All life are in ambivalence

27
00:02:16,406 --> 00:02:21,202
And it twinkles as the days goes by

28
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:27,794
Both short-lived flowers and devastating winds

29
00:02:27,794 --> 00:02:32,046
are the sign of the passing present

30
00:02:32,841 --> 00:02:38,832
To those who live in the moment, this song shall reach you

31
00:02:38,832 --> 00:02:46,922
It will push you to the limits of freedom, telling you to survive

32
00:02:46,922 --> 00:02:49,697
We will find the way

33
00:02:49,697 --> 00:02:58,030
We returners all equally carry a seed of hope

34
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:04,533
Under the whim of miracle, Birth and Demise shall join hand

35
00:03:04,533 --> 00:03:08,592
and the time will flow once again

36
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:22,680
The Kingdom of Filtwood.

37
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:25,750
This nation borders the Great Forest of Jura,

38
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:28,800
and Shizu paid a visit there, after receiving an urgent request.

39
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:33,310
The request was to defeat a demon that had been revived.

40
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:38,300
Welcome to Filtwood Castle.

41
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:39,190
It's a real honor

42
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:42,950
to meet the famous Conqueror of Flames!

43
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:44,450
Right this way.

44
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:46,950
I'll show you to the reception hall.

45
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,770
Shizue Izawa!

46
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:55,210
The Conqueror of Flames!

47
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:57,260
Now, this is reassuring.

48
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,590
Wow... They've gathered up quite a few.

49
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:02,470
Hey!

50
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:04,250
If it isn't Shizu!

51
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:06,320
Good to see you again, Cougar-san.

52
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,490
You took on this request, too, huh?

53
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:10,470
It was a request from the nation.

54
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:13,470
Man, you're as serious as ever!

55
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:16,610
You could've just come up with some random reason to ditch it.

56
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:19,170
Well, you're here, too, aren't you?

57
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:22,520
Hey, I'm just here for the pay.

58
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,610
But...

59
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:26,140
I sorta regret it now.

60
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:29,760
Apparently, at least ten really skilled adventurers have died already.

61
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:30,910
I see.

62
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:34,800
But the arrival of the champion is gonna give hope to everyone!

63
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,300
You're exaggerating.

64
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:41,800
That's the minister.

65
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:48,300
Adventurers, I bring unfortunate news.

66
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:53,190
Our champions, the two Silver Wings, have passed on.

67
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:54,770
-What?! -Those two?!

68
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:56,040
Are you serious?

69
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:59,900
It appears their bodies were devoured with no trace left behind.

70
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:04,610
The request given to you is to defeat the resurrected demon.

71
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:07,960
This account has been found in a century-old text.

72
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:11,410
The champion Orthos, huh?

73
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,770
But all this tells us

74
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:19,000
is that the demon was successfully sealed away by the knight Orthos.

75
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:22,000
It does not mention how he sealed him.

76
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,900
This is why we wish to rely on all of your strengths.

77
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:27,470
There's not enough info on the enemy!

78
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:29,010
Are you telling us to go die?!

79
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:32,410
The Silver Wings were heroes famous enough to have titles!

80
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:36,460
If they failed, there aren't enough lives between all of us to survive this!

81
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:37,520
I agree.

82
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,900
Sorry, but this one's too dangerous. I'm out.

83
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:42,630
Wait!

84
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:47,020
We need the help of all of you to defeat this demon!

85
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:48,110
Shut up!

86
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,620
Oh, man...

87
00:05:56,130 --> 00:05:57,870
Please, calm down!

88
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:03,150
In truth, the one thing we do know is what the demon is after.

89
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:05,010
What do you mean?

90
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:10,890
There are remains laid to rest in the castle's underground reception hall.

91
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:14,680
Those remains are the very body of that demon,

92
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:20,610
and his objective is to recover it and complete his resurrection.

93
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,450
The demon's...

94
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:23,482
...remains?

95
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:30,930
Ah! That must be the renowned Shizue Izawa!

96
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:32,870
I will gladly answer any question you ask.

97
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:36,170
If this demon drove the kingdom to the brink of ruin

98
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:39,040
and defeated the two Silver Wings,

99
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:43,370
he may be a superior demon, an Archdemon.

100
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:44,500
Yes...

101
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,680
That brings me to my question.

102
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,010
Does this demon have a name?

103
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:58,590
Monsters gain far greater power when they are granted names.

104
00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:02,620
This was common knowledge among all capable adventurers.

105
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:07,070
No, there are no accounts indicating that the demon had a name.

106
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:12,860
If he has no name, he can't be an Archdemon.

107
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,700
But it's hard to imagine the Silver Wings losing otherwise.

108
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:23,330
So your intent was to bring us all here to wait for the demon to arrive?

109
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:24,660
Indeed.

110
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:26,740
Now that the Silver Wings have fallen,

111
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:29,100
this strategy is our only hope.

112
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:34,140
He says that, but he seems to see us as enemies.

113
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:37,560
Screw that! I have no obligation to serve this nation!

114
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,930
I'm outta here!

115
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:44,550
He killed him!

116
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,290
What's the meaning of this?!

117
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:47,890
Hey! What are you thinking?!

118
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:52,400
Quiet! Before you curse me, take a good look at this man!

119
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,080
What is this?!

120
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,780
What's going on?

121
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:06,080
A lesser demon...

122
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:26,530
You see that? We have isolated all of you in this location

123
00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:29,940
because some of you may have been possessed by demons, like he was.

124
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:33,280
It would behoove you all to do as we say and cooperate.

125
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:38,580
Try anything funny, and you can expect to be seen as a demon and cut down.

126
00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:42,080
This has turned ugly.

127
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:45,540
This looks bad. These guys are panicking.

128
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:48,960
Makes sense, if it's possible someone could be possessed.

129
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:51,400
That would include you and me, Shizu.

130
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,380
True.

131
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:56,710
So he wants us to find out ourselves which among us are the demons?

132
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,900
Who's this guy?

133
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:02,300
No idea. Never seen him before.

134
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,100
Shizu...

135
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:09,740
Yes. He's very powerful.

136
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:12,690
He seems to be a mage, but he shows no weaknesses.

137
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:17,200
Unbelievable... I didn't even sense his presence before.

138
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:22,670
By making us believe there was a demon here,

139
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:26,210
you hoped it wouldn't build cooperation among all of us, didn't you?

140
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:28,720
What are you saying?

141
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:34,380
Oh, it just seemed that this request would be completed far more easily than expected.

142
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:36,220
I couldn't help but laugh.

143
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:38,390
Captain of the knights...

144
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:44,280
You said that if we tried anything funny, we'd be seen as demons and cut down, right?

145
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,590
So, what will it be?

146
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:50,980
I have no intention of obeying you people,

147
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:53,830
nor do I have any intention of playing along with this charade.

148
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:55,960
Charade, you say?

149
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:57,608
Yes.

150
00:09:57,608 --> 00:10:00,490
It was you who summoned the lesser demon.

151
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:03,610
Are you trying to mock me?!

152
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:06,790
You may intend to gloss over it,

153
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:09,120
but I must say, your efforts are pathetic.

154
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:12,020
You dare defy the principles of this nation?!

155
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:16,310
Oh, no. It saves me a great deal of work, so I'm all for it.

156
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:17,524
Huh?

157
00:10:17,524 --> 00:10:20,870
The request was to defeat a revived demon,

158
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:25,930
but there is no restriction saying the demon is the only one we can kill.

159
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:29,050
This nation's principle seems to be much the same.

160
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:33,440
I've simply determined that there's no reason I should be the only one rebuked.

161
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,680
What do you...

162
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:42,800
Do you intend to slaughter everyone here to find the demon?

163
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:44,450
Correct.

164
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:46,920
I am Shizu.

165
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,170
Who... are you?

166
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:54,220
You can call me... Kuro.

167
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:57,780
It was an imitation name given to me by an old acquaintance.

168
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,480
Kuro...

169
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:02,150
I cannot tolerate what you're doing.

170
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:07,270
In that case, you shall be the first one I kill.

171
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:16,730
Flames have no effect on me.

172
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:21,440
I see... A superior spirit...

173
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,480
And it even identifies with you.

174
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:27,220
That will be a slight hassle, but no real problem.

175
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:30,500
I shall play with you for a bit.

176
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:36,130
Don't underestimate me.

177
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:51,610
W-Wow...

178
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:55,480
That's the power of the champion who reigns at the top?

179
00:11:56,410 --> 00:11:57,440
Shizu...

180
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:03,320
Just who are you?

181
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:07,240
Should one who is about to die be concerned with that?

182
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:10,120
Knowing will only bring you despair...

183
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:13,460
If you knew at all, that is!

184
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:22,720
Of course, who I am is no business of yours.

185
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:24,760
True, it isn't.

186
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:28,990
But letting you run free would be far too dangerous.

187
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:31,850
So I'm sorry, but I'm about to get serious!

188
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,610
Interesting.

189
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:39,670
That lax attitude will be what kills you.

190
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:43,700
I'm ending this now!

191
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:45,320
Inferno Flame!

192
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,059
Seriously?!

193
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:02,730
Excellent.

194
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:08,420
How remarkable that a mere human is capable of using Ifrit's power at this level.

195
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:12,390
It has been some time since I truly felt that I was fighting, as I do now.

196
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:15,390
So you're a demon... It's hard to believe.

197
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:17,950
He's unharmed after taking those flames head-on?

198
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:20,150
No, I must correct you.

199
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:24,060
I am not unharmed. I did feel a bit of pain.

200
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:26,280
That is exactly what makes this fight so fun.

201
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:30,540
Now, let's put an end to this.

202
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:38,630
What?!

203
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:45,600
Impossible... That mask...

204
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,640
That time compression... Is it... infinity?

205
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,420
Infinity?!

206
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:56,860
I can only assume that your mask surpasses time.

207
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:59,650
To think there's a human who can use such an item...

208
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,180
How intriguing!

209
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:07,690
Very well. That will be enough for today.

210
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:15,610
-Awesome! -That's our Conqueror of Flames!

211
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:16,793
Way to go!

212
00:14:16,793 --> 00:14:22,190
We have no intention whatsoever of neglecting you adventurers.

213
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:25,170
We only need to know the demon's identity.

214
00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:29,760
Thank goodness he withdrew.

215
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:34,330
His strength... He was holding back against me.

216
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:35,720
And...

217
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:42,030
Oh, it just seemed that my request would be completed far more easily than expected.

218
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:47,400
Request? Who could employ such a powerful demon?

219
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:49,550
Unbelievable.

220
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:57,160
Demon Lord Leon told me once

221
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:00,300
of demons who were known as the progenitors.

222
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:05,840
These demons are quite heretical, making them rather troublesome.

223
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:10,640
In place of names, each of them is referred to by their signature color.

224
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:12,790
The Red Progenitor, Rouge...

225
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:14,430
The White Progenitor, Blanc...

226
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:17,800
And the Black Progenitor, Noir.

227
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,900
Black... Noir...

228
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,190
It couldn't be.

229
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:26,190
Such a being wouldn't come here.

230
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,320
Come in.

231
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:37,860
Pardon the intrusion. His Majesty wishes to speak with you.

232
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:39,760
Would you accompany me?

233
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:41,120
All right.

234
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:45,630
You were brilliant in that fight earlier.

235
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:48,010
That demon was so frightened of you that he—

236
00:15:48,010 --> 00:15:50,480
I was lucky to survive.

237
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:53,160
That demon was stronger than me.

238
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,100
Please, there's no need to be modest.

239
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:58,010
It is regrettable that he managed to escape,

240
00:15:58,010 --> 00:16:01,210
but with you here, we have nothing to fear!

241
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:09,270
Underground? Is this where the demon's remains are?

242
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:11,800
This knight...

243
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:14,450
I didn't see him in the reception hall.

244
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:17,840
So how did he know about my fight with the demon?

245
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:29,550
The minister and...

246
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,400
the king?

247
00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:45,650
Thank you for coming, Shizu.

248
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:51,400
As king, I am grateful that you have offered your life for this nation.

249
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:53,710
What's the meaning of this?

250
00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:56,500
You are rather slow to catch on, aren't you?

251
00:16:56,500 --> 00:17:00,520
You must be exhausted after your battle earlier.

252
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:04,460
This is why we need to sacrifice you while we still can.

253
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:08,540
I see... You were in collusion from the start.

254
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:12,170
Precisely. My name is Orthos.

255
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:17,580
The Imperial Knight hailed as a champion, Orthos...

256
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:19,300
So that's it.

257
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:22,340
You were never sealed away at all.

258
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:26,450
You were a demon, an enemy of mankind.

259
00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:30,110
I am the ruler of this land, as well.

260
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:34,470
You meant to gather all the best adventurers, eliminate them,

261
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:35,700
and pass them off as demons...

262
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,600
Then you, the true demon, would gain even more power.

263
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:44,460
The Kingdom of Filtwood is ruled by demons,

264
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:47,200
and the king is merely their puppet.

265
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:51,110
I watched through the minister's eyes.

266
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:55,090
That demon was powerful, but he disappointed me, in the end.

267
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:58,470
What intrigues me more is your mask.

268
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:01,530
It seems to have significant value.

269
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:04,220
That makes it suitable for me to own.

270
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:07,740
I will suck out your blood, devour your flesh,

271
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:11,180
and make your power my own.

272
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:12,730
Aren't you glad?

273
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:15,030
Be serious.

274
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:20,030
Don't be a fool! Your magic hasn't even recovered.

275
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:24,290
And you think you can defeat me?

276
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:27,770
I have to face him without any chance to prepare...

277
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,210
But I have no choice!

278
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:37,970
Ah, you still have that much strength left?

279
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:41,970
If you could injure me, you must be stronger than the Silver Wings.

280
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:44,650
So it was you!

281
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:48,480
Indeed, though a lapse in my attention allowed them to escape.

282
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:52,060
But you will not get away.

283
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:59,230
Did you know that there are ranks among demons?

284
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:03,320
I am of the legendary class, a Greater Demon General...

285
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:05,450
that is, an Archdemon!

286
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:15,470
Understand now? As a man-made hero,

287
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:18,380
the voices of this nation's people give me power.

288
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:20,800
That power gave me a name,

289
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:24,140
allowing me to become a named being on my own.

290
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:27,640
Just like that supreme being who reigns at the top...

291
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,140
The top?

292
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:33,150
There is no need for you to know.

293
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:40,030
Even one hailed as a champion has no more power than this?!

294
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:45,940
What's the matter? Not going to unify with Ifrit?

295
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:48,970
That would make you a little stronger.

296
00:19:52,530 --> 00:19:56,710
I'm out of magic, but Ifrit still has strength.

297
00:19:56,710 --> 00:20:00,800
If I let it rampage, it should be enough to defeat even an Archdemon!

298
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,550
Now, we can't have that.

299
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:09,310
How can one who caused me pain die at the hands of this weakling?

300
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:14,960
You're...

301
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:18,440
It is my policy to keep my promises.

302
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:24,700
Wh-What is...

303
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:29,620
Impossible! Our knights are renowned for their unrivaled strength!

304
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:34,680
You call it "unrivaled strength" just because they can kill a mere lesser demon?

305
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:38,880
Your standards for strength are far too low.

306
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:43,880
You are indeed strong, but you are no match for us!

307
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:46,430
After the Conqueror of Flames, you'll be next!

308
00:20:46,430 --> 00:20:47,640
Just wait there—

309
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:57,620
I-It can't be! We have the protection of a greater demon!

310
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,910
Stop squealing, trash.

311
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:09,950
I never really thought he'd just escaped,

312
00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:12,940
but I had no idea he was hunting down demons disguised as humans...

313
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:19,050
Just because you defeated our puppets,

314
00:21:19,050 --> 00:21:22,070
do you think you can defeat me, an Archdemon?

315
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:24,550
A lower demon like you can't—

316
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:29,100
Who are you calling "lower"?

317
00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:32,290
For a dependent of Red, you are overconfident.

318
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:35,600
That's why you can't judge how powerful your opponents are.

319
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:38,100
I-Impossible!

320
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:42,730
You... You are...

321
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:46,080
You have disgraced yourself by aligning with these demons.

322
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,990
You don't deserve to live.

323
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:53,430
I will destroy your very soul so that you can never be revived!

324
00:21:54,330 --> 00:21:59,010
No... No!

325
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:11,220
All the demons dwelling in the Kingdom of Filtwood were purged.

326
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:16,880
The deaths of the king and minister were proclaimed the work of the demon named Black,

327
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:21,130
and the records indicated that Shizu defeated Black.

328
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:26,230
Well, if we can keep our stories straight,

329
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:29,280
I will refrain from targeting you.

330
00:22:35,650 --> 00:22:39,000
Who the heck was that "Black" guy, anyway?

331
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:41,320
I think we're better off not knowing.

332
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:46,260
I guess. Sometimes ignorance is bliss in this world.

333
00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:50,460
Well, I'm heading out. Take care of yourself.

334
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:52,620
I will. Until we meet again.

335
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,830
Well, then...

336
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:04,630
I'm sure someone will do something about that demon someday.

337
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:11,530
And so, time passed...

338
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:20,710
That mask showed up again... So it's true.

339
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:22,040
That slime is...

340
00:23:22,790 --> 00:23:25,040
That being truly is...

341
00:23:29,630 --> 00:23:32,930
Thus, silent and one-sided though it was,

342
00:23:32,930 --> 00:23:36,270
Rimuru and Black had their fateful first encounter.

343
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:39,420
Black would later be summoned by Rimuru

344
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:40,990
and receive a name:

345
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,110
"Diablo."

346
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:49,160
Next time, "Tales: Veldora's Journal."
