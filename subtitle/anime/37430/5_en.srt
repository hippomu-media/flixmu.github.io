1
00:00:00,447 --> 00:00:05,168
Beyond a Fiction that nobody knows,

2
00:00:05,168 --> 00:00:10,523
here I open a nameless Story!

3
00:00:23,394 --> 00:00:28,030
The sky above holds a tomorrow brimming with hope

4
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:33,355
My days were vauge as I'm wondering What's the name?

5
00:00:33,355 --> 00:00:37,919
It took my far-reaching dream that kept me standing in awe

6
00:00:37,919 --> 00:00:43,079
along with my despair and consume them all away

7
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:47,534
My voice has been engraved by the shape of my wish

8
00:00:47,534 --> 00:00:52,051
Make it stronger, stronger, even stronger!

9
00:00:52,051 --> 00:00:55,205
Fly high!

10
00:00:56,906 --> 00:01:01,928
Beyond a Fiction that nobody knows,

11
00:01:01,928 --> 00:01:06,960
There's a slowly sprouting impulse of Skill to stay alive

12
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:11,823
If what I feel right now is Reality, then it will surely be a proof someday

13
00:01:11,823 --> 00:01:16,742
Each one of your story, I shall give a name to it

14
00:01:16,742 --> 00:01:22,053
to the east, to the west, to the high stand up to the period!

15
00:01:22,053 --> 00:01:24,645
Let's go!

16
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:41,640
Man, that sure threw me for a loop!

17
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:46,710
I busted my ass to make that sword, and you made all those copies in seconds!

18
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:50,210
Only because the original you made was so incredible.

19
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:52,580
All I did was analyze it

20
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:55,210
and use that magisteel cluster to copy it.

21
00:01:57,490 --> 00:01:59,140
Was I out of line?

22
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:06,490
If I'm being honest, it is a little vexing...

23
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:13,000
But next time, I'll make one so amazing that even you won't be able to copy it!

24
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,590
I relish the challenge!

25
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:18,140
That's the spirit!

26
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:19,740
Refill, please!

27
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:22,620
Can you even taste this?

28
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:28,370
I can't, but any drink is delicious if a pretty lady pours it for me!

29
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:30,510
Oh, very smooth!

30
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:31,920
Here you go.

31
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:37,130
It's nice being the one entertained for once.

32
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:39,950
As a human, I was always the one doing the entertaining.

33
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:42,510
There was a lot I had to be attentive to.

34
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:46,820
Ah, this is paradise!

35
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:52,500
Meanwhile, Gobta had been completely forgotten.

36
00:02:57,610 --> 00:02:59,070
Hey, Mr. Slime!

37
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:02,570
Would you like to try this?

38
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:06,720
I'm very good at it.

39
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,690
Everyone says I'm pretty amazing, in fact.

40
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:14,500
C-Could this be the legend I've heard about?!

41
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:18,820
Is she gonna do that...

42
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:21,220
No!

43
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:23,390
and even that?!

44
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:25,650
Uh, th-that's...

45
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:29,560
M-Ma'am, we mustn't...

46
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:32,160
-Mr. Slime? -Ma'am... Ma'am...

47
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,560
Mr. Slime!

48
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:35,780
Are you ready?

49
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:38,610
Oh. She meant fortunetelling.

50
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:41,860
So what kind of reading can you do?

51
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,940
Well...

52
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:46,030
What would you like?

53
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:50,700
How about the person he's destined to be with?

54
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:51,900
Huh?

55
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:56,090
Oh, good idea!

56
00:03:57,770 --> 00:03:59,900
Okay, here I go.

57
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:07,320
What's this? I can't see anything.

58
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,378
Hey!

59
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:10,720
I'm just kidding.

60
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,980
You're so silly, Mr. Slime!

61
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:14,053
Huh? Me?

62
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:16,810
Okay, for real this time.

63
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:25,180
The person I'm destined to be with...

64
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:27,830
Could someone like that really be in this world?

65
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:31,950
Maybe it's actually a slime I'm destined to be with.

66
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:34,080
Oh, I see something!

67
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:03,280
She sort of looked Japanese...

68
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,770
That was one pretty girl.

69
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,610
You're turning red.

70
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:08,500
Huh?!

71
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,240
I don't change colors!

72
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:14,040
Oh, you're curious about this girl you're destined to be with, huh?

73
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:17,220
No fair, cheating on us!

74
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:19,540
Sure, I'm curious, but...

75
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:21,940
Destined, huh?

76
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:25,070
If she's also Japanese, I guess I'd like to meet her.

77
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:29,470
Should you really be wasting time in a place like this,

78
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:34,210
Kaijin?

79
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:37,440
It's Minister Vesta.

80
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:39,360
So that's him?

81
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,080
He looks pretty stubborn and high-strung.

82
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:48,110
Is this a good time to be playing around?

83
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:51,240
I believe the deadline for those longswords is...

84
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,870
I just sent them in.

85
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:55,750
If you don't get them finished in time...

86
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:58,820
What? You sent them in?!

87
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:01,150
Yep. All twenty of them.

88
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:03,020
B-But that's...

89
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:05,480
Want to see the invoice?

90
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:09,580
Is that so?

91
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:10,705
Well, well, finishing your work in the time allotted is to be expected.

92
00:06:10,705 --> 00:06:15,324
Did this Minister Vesta guy knowingly give him an impossible order?

93
00:06:15,324 --> 00:06:16,569
Yes, it's only to be expected.

94
00:06:16,569 --> 00:06:18,750
Doesn't look like they're on good terms...

95
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:21,270
I'm more concerned with that!

96
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,270
Huh? Me?

97
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:30,090
You shouldn't bring such a lowly monster into a high-brow establishment like this.

98
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,520
It's making me feel ill.

99
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:37,240
Hey! Do you allow monsters to be brought in here?

100
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:41,080
It may be a monster, but it seems like a harmless slime.

101
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:42,280
What?

102
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:45,000
It is a monster, am I wrong?

103
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,130
Are you trying to say slimes aren't monsters?

104
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:51,640
No, not in the least.

105
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:56,040
Come, now, Minister. How about a drink?

106
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,520
Please, help yourself.

107
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:03,160
Hmph. This is what should be done to monsters.

108
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:05,310
Mr. Slime!

109
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:09,200
Don't worry. I'm okay.

110
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,620
Did your dress get wet?

111
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:12,160
I-I'm fine...

112
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,410
That made me mad,

113
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:17,660
but the guy's a minister.

114
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:21,980
I can't let my short temper screw things up for Kaijin and this bar.

115
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:26,060
Fruit wine. Alcohol content: 7%.

116
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:28,800
Uh, Great Sage, I don't need that info right now.

117
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:37,550
Vesta!

118
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:42,530
I hope you're prepared to pay for treating my guest like that.

119
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:45,010
Y-You...

120
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:47,259
How dare you speak to me like that?!

121
00:07:47,259 --> 00:07:48,648
Shut up!

122
00:07:48,648 --> 00:07:49,700
Hey, Kaijin!

123
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,065
Go easy on him!

124
00:07:51,065 --> 00:07:52,860
Not the face! Go for the body!

125
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,010
Was that a good idea? Isn't he a minister?

126
00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:04,710
Won't this mean trouble for you?

127
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:10,550
Hey, Rimuru...

128
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:14,090
You were looking for skilled artisans, right?

129
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:19,407
Would you settle for me?

130
00:08:19,407 --> 00:08:21,480
What?! You mean it?

131
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:24,273
I don't need to settle if I have you!

132
00:08:24,273 --> 00:08:27,110
I'd be thrilled to have your help, Kaijin!

133
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:35,600
But things rarely work out so smoothly in this world.

134
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:40,790
C'mon, Bro, what were you thinking?

135
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:48,300
Hmph. That moron there was rude to my buddy Rimuru.

136
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:50,990
I just gave him a little scolding.

137
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:53,620
"A little"?

138
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:56,661
You know you can't do that to a minister.

139
00:08:56,930 --> 00:08:57,800
Hmph.

140
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:03,050
Don't hold this against me. It's just the law.

141
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:07,550
I'll have to keep you all restrained until your trial.

142
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:08,540
Move.

143
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:10,480
It's just our job, you know.

144
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:16,700
Trial?

145
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:26,790
You've been asleep all this time?!

146
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,960
If only I hadn't lost my temper...

147
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:34,260
I dragged you all into this.

148
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:37,090
I'm sorry.

149
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:39,870
Hey, it's okay! No problem!

150
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:42,430
Nothing you need to worry about!

151
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:44,730
Speak, man!

152
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:48,020
Are we going to be put on trial?

153
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,970
Yeah, I guess so.

154
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:52,690
We won't be executed or anything, though.

155
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:55,070
We'll probably just have to pay a fine.

156
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:58,170
I hope so...

157
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:02,910
But that minister really seemed to have it in for you.

158
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:11,290
I used to serve this nation's king, Gazel Dwargo.

159
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:16,850
I was the captain of one of the seven orders of royal knights.

160
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:21,660
At the time, he was my adjutant.

161
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:23,180
He came from the marquis's family,

162
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:25,960
and I was from a family of peasants.

163
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:28,240
It must have infuriated him.

164
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,190
Even back then, we clashed all the time.

165
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:33,590
And then...

166
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:54,750
One of the projects he'd been under pressure to complete, the Magisoldier Project...

167
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:57,680
went up in smoke.

168
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:03,330
Vesta foisted all the responsibility for his failure onto me.

169
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:08,060
He got our forces on his side and even came up with false testimony.

170
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,900
So I assumed responsibility and quit the force.

171
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,920
He still holds a grudge against me and

172
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:20,280
makes unreasonable demands of me at every opportunity.

173
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:23,110
That's what this was all about, too.

174
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:25,030
He's pretty pathetic.

175
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:26,700
You got that right.

176
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:31,290
But it's not as if he's a bad guy, really.

177
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,680
He and I weren't a good match,

178
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,500
but he was always a hard worker and passionate about his research.

179
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:41,560
The pressure he felt to complete that project came from his need to please the king.

180
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:47,180
If I leave this country, it might make him a better man.

181
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:49,030
You really think so?

182
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:51,810
Well, Rimuru...

183
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,560
I'm all yours.

184
00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:55,730
Thanks.

185
00:11:58,380 --> 00:11:59,820
About that...

186
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:02,650
We're gonna follow Kaijin, too.

187
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:04,970
Yeah.

188
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:07,950
We'll go anywhere if it means we can work with Kaijin.

189
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,200
Yeah, I figured.

190
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,620
You guys...

191
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:18,880
Rimuru, would we be in your way if we tagged along?

192
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:22,730
Heh. I'll be glad to take all of you in!

193
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:24,760
But be ready. I'm gonna work you to the bone!

194
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,120
Right!

195
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:44,780
He's even silent when he's sleeping.

196
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:53,320
Great Rimuru? Did something happen?

197
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,540
He's so carefree...

198
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:59,840
We've got some things to do. Mind if we leave you here?

199
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,225
Huh?

200
00:13:01,225 --> 00:13:04,870
If you want to get out, call your Tempest Wolf partner.

201
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:07,253
Wait... What?! That's just mean!

202
00:13:07,253 --> 00:13:11,130
Don't worry. I won't forget to come back for you when we're done.

203
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:21,350
I'd feel bad getting him dragged in to this trial when he wasn't involved.

204
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:38,430
His Majesty Gazel Dwargo will now enter!

205
00:13:56,620 --> 00:14:00,300
The judge presiding over Rimuru's party is the Hero King of the Dwarves,

206
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:01,990
Gazel Dwargo.

207
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,650
Yikes, this guy's bad news! He's a beast!

208
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:07,200
He's obviously strong!

209
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:11,990
The trial will now begin.

210
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:13,370
All rise.

211
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:16,910
I'm rising.

212
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,737
In the Armed Nation of Dwargon,

213
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:23,950
no one can speak during a trial without the king's permission.

214
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:27,900
For that reason, a proxy speaks for the defense...

215
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:33,890
As we have seen, when Minister Vesta was enjoying a drink in said establishment,

216
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:38,520
Kaijin and his gang stormed the place and assaulted him.

217
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:42,270
Such behavior must not be tolerated.

218
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:45,280
He's been bought.

219
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:49,100
What? Isn't he supposed to be defending us?

220
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:50,217
Also...

221
00:14:50,217 --> 00:14:53,280
I don't remember him being that injured...

222
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:55,540
Is this true?

223
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,370
Yes. There is no mistake.

224
00:14:58,570 --> 00:15:02,630
King Gazel, have you heard all this?

225
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:06,560
Please pass strict judgment upon these people!

226
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:10,750
Kaijin said Vesta wasn't a bad guy,

227
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:13,140
but he totally is.

228
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,890
Your Majesty!

229
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:22,020
I will now state the verdict.

230
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:25,790
It doesn't look like we'll get out of this with just a fine.

231
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:27,780
I've got a really bad feeling...

232
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:30,000
The principal offender, Kaijin,

233
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,510
is sentenced to twenty years of forced labor in the mines.

234
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:35,584
Huh?!

235
00:15:35,584 --> 00:15:41,370
And his accomplices are sentenced to ten years of forced labor in the mines.

236
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:43,654
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

237
00:15:43,654 --> 00:15:46,580
The court is now adjourned.

238
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:47,343
H...

239
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:49,200
Hey! Wait just a minute!

240
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,119
Wait.

241
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:56,660
It's been some time, Kaijin.

242
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,430
Have you been well?

243
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:00,197
Yes.

244
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:04,532
Kaijin, you may answer His Majesty.

245
00:16:04,532 --> 00:16:05,410
Yes, Your Majesty.

246
00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:09,690
I am relieved to find you in good health, as well.

247
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:12,110
Kaijin.

248
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:17,364
Have you any interest in returning to my ranks?

249
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:30,320
Forgive me, Your Majesty, but I have already found my master.

250
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,769
My sworn oath is my greatest treasure.

251
00:16:33,769 --> 00:16:39,486
I will never part with this treasure, even if Your Majesty orders it.

252
00:16:39,486 --> 00:16:40,583
Insolence!

253
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:43,690
Wha... You're kidding!

254
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:51,885
I see.

255
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:58,740
I will now pass judgment.

256
00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:03,010
Kaijin and his companions shall be exiled.

257
00:17:03,010 --> 00:17:04,380
That concludes my verdict.

258
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:08,020
Disappear from my sight at once!

259
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:12,330
We got off with just exile...

260
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:14,723
Still...

261
00:17:14,723 --> 00:17:16,700
He seems a little sad.

262
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,620
This court is now adjourned.

263
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:31,610
Now then, Vesta, is there anything you wish to say?

264
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:35,280
Y-Your Majesty... I...

265
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,110
W-Well...

266
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:39,520
It is unfortunate.

267
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:43,870
I have lost a loyal retainer.

268
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:47,460
H-How can you say such a thing? Kaijin...

269
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:51,500
That man did not swear loyalty to you!

270
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:54,350
He chose some slime of unknown background to—

271
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:55,610
Vesta.

272
00:17:56,210 --> 00:17:58,669
You are mistaken.

273
00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:03,140
The loyal retainer I have lost...

274
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:04,800
is, in fact...

275
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:14,580
I had great hopes for you.

276
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:20,070
I waited years, even through the failure of the Magisoldier Project,

277
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:23,830
for you to tell me the truth.

278
00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:26,960
Y-Your Majesty, please...

279
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:28,940
And now, as well...

280
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:31,559
Look there.

281
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:36,647
Do you know what that is?

282
00:18:36,647 --> 00:18:41,330
It is a full potion, a draught of complete recovery, made from hipokute herbs.

283
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:42,350
But...

284
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:45,370
Even with the most advanced dwarven techniques,

285
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:49,310
a potion can only achieve 98% recovery at most...

286
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,900
How is this possible?

287
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:55,780
It was that slime who gave it to us.

288
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:04,160
Your actions have severed our relationship with that slime.

289
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:07,910
Now, is there anything you wish to say?

290
00:19:12,410 --> 00:19:16,500
I have nothing to say, Your Majesty.

291
00:19:23,410 --> 00:19:28,260
I wanted only to be useful to you.

292
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:35,320
Ever since I first saw you as a young boy,

293
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:39,190
that is all I have ever wanted.

294
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:47,900
Did I choose the wrong path?

295
00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:51,180
Was it when I began to envy Kaijin?

296
00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:54,970
Or was it even earlier?

297
00:19:58,210 --> 00:20:00,710
For betraying Your Majesty's expectations...

298
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:03,480
I ask your forgiveness.

299
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:10,290
Vesta, never show yourself before me again.

300
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:15,480
I have one last thing to say to you.

301
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:18,760
Thank you for your service.

302
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,830
Take care of yourself, Bro.

303
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:35,460
Sorry for all the trouble. You take care, too.

304
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:39,710
Rimuru, take care of my brother.

305
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:42,470
No need to worry. I'll only work him to death.

306
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:50,640
In accordance with the king's sentence, Kaijin and his companions are now exiled.

307
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,230
Leave at once!

308
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:10,040
Well, shall we get moving?

309
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:12,950
My friends are waiting in the forest.

310
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,220
Right.

311
00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:18,330
Despite all that happened,

312
00:21:18,330 --> 00:21:22,890
Rimuru achieved his initial goal of bringing back some artisans.

313
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:28,340
And they happened to be some of the most skilled artisans around.

314
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:37,110
You've apprehended the proxy?

315
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:38,660
Punish him severely.

316
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:39,550
Of course.

317
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:43,000
And observe that slime's movements.

318
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:46,380
It is unthinkable that such a monster has been released.

319
00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:51,680
Do not be noticed, no matter what it takes.

320
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:52,727
Of course.

321
00:21:56,210 --> 00:21:58,030
That slime is a true beast...

322
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:03,390
Just like the Storm Dragon, Veldora!

323
00:22:17,114 --> 00:22:22,894
Why is it only those who have hope

324
00:22:22,894 --> 00:22:28,391
To fall into despair from the bottom of their heart?

325
00:22:28,391 --> 00:22:33,315
Why is it only those who have courage

326
00:22:33,315 --> 00:22:39,257
To be wounded at the end of their honor?

327
00:22:39,257 --> 00:22:44,974
I don't want to close my eyes in face of sadness

328
00:22:44,974 --> 00:22:50,603
The dawn for new tomorrow was a mere dream to me

329
00:22:50,603 --> 00:22:56,375
Then I see a light falling through the crack of the night

330
00:22:56,375 --> 00:23:02,826
The sky is crying

331
00:23:03,331 --> 00:23:08,895
I don't know what is there at the corner of the world

332
00:23:08,895 --> 00:23:14,511
All I want is to protect those within my reach

333
00:23:14,511 --> 00:23:20,730
Staring at the only reason to fight

334
00:23:20,730 --> 00:23:27,916
We who believe the answer to be forgiveness...

335
00:23:27,916 --> 00:23:32,670
Must not lose!

336
00:23:35,810 --> 00:23:37,990
Next time, "Shizu."
