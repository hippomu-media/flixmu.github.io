1
00:00:10,424 --> 00:00:15,991
In the night you could count stars in the sky

2
00:00:15,991 --> 00:00:21,489
The overflown drop reflects the swaying world

3
00:00:21,489 --> 00:00:27,386
All life are in ambivalence

4
00:00:27,386 --> 00:00:32,182
And it twinkles as the days goes by

5
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:38,774
Both short-lived flowers and devastating winds

6
00:00:38,774 --> 00:00:43,026
are the sign of the passing present

7
00:00:43,821 --> 00:00:49,812
To those who live in the moment, this song shall reach you

8
00:00:49,812 --> 00:00:57,902
It will push you to the limits of freedom, telling you to survive

9
00:00:57,902 --> 00:01:00,677
We will find the way

10
00:01:00,677 --> 00:01:09,010
We returners all equally carry a seed of hope

11
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:15,513
Under the whim of miracle, Birth and Demise shall join hand

12
00:01:15,513 --> 00:01:19,572
and the time will flow once again

13
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:35,190
Okay, I'm going to call the roll.

14
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:37,440
Kenya Misaki-kun.

15
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:40,610
Ryota Sekiguchi-kun.

16
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:43,550
Gale Gibson-kun.

17
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,500
Alice Rondo-san.

18
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,620
Chloe Aubert-san.

19
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:52,510
All right, now, listen up...

20
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:56,990
When your name is called, respond loudly and clearly.

21
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:03,020
Right, right, I understand.

22
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:06,488
Okay, I'm going to call in a friend of mine.

23
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:10,620
Kenya Misaki-kun.

24
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:11,582
H-Here!

25
00:02:11,582 --> 00:02:13,170
Ryota Sekiguchi-kun.

26
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:14,202
Here!

27
00:02:14,202 --> 00:02:15,770
Gale Gibson-kun.

28
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:16,592
Here!

29
00:02:16,592 --> 00:02:18,220
Alice Rondo-san.

30
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:19,281
H-Here!

31
00:02:19,281 --> 00:02:20,910
Chloe Aubert-san.

32
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:21,760
Here...

33
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:24,330
Okay! Very good!

34
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:30,360
Hey! Threatening us with this giant dog is dirty!

35
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:36,300
I am Ranga. Nice to meet you, kid.

36
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:38,090
F-Fine, I get it!

37
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:41,380
Looks like you're good friends already.

38
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:42,600
That's great.

39
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:46,890
So, I'm Rimuru, and I'll be your teacher starting today.

40
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:51,440
I'm not as nice as Shizu-san. Just keep that in mind.

41
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:55,730
What? No response?

42
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:58,820
Yes, sir!

43
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,500
Looks like it won't be easy to gain their trust.

44
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:07,660
Well, I can't blame them.

45
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:11,230
They were summoned into this world and then tossed aside.

46
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:15,960
Okay! Are you all ready for a test?

47
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:19,080
Hey! Why do we have to do that?

48
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,090
I hate tests.

49
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,810
It's too soon for a test! I demand an explanation!

50
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:25,220
Yeah! Explain this!

51
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:27,880
Now, just relax.

52
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:32,270
This test is one that you kids need right now.

53
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:36,000
We're just gonna die sooner or later, anyway.

54
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,520
What's the point in studying?

55
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,530
Th-That's right.

56
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:42,790
Our other teachers said we could just play as we wanted.

57
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:45,410
We haven't studied at all since we came here.

58
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:48,810
I want to read picture books more.

59
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:51,040
Who do you think you are, anyway?!

60
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:54,400
Yes, yes. It's good to have so much energy.

61
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,050
Don't worry. I called it a test, but it's a fun game.

62
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,630
A game?

63
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:05,090
It'll give you children... I mean, you guys a chance to vent your frustrations.

64
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:11,140
You will each fight a one-on-one mock battle with me.

65
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:12,780
You'll have ten minutes.

66
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:16,060
If you can defeat me in that time, you win.

67
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:17,900
Well? Easy enough, right?

68
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:19,480
That's it?

69
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,400
Yep.

70
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:21,730
Ten minutes?

71
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:22,650
Yeah.

72
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:27,070
Hah! So long as you don't sic that dog on us, we won't need ten minutes!

73
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,470
I can promise you I won't do that.

74
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:31,290
Ranga, don't interfere.

75
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:32,234
Right.

76
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:34,410
I'm gonna win!

77
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:36,540
I want to read my picture book...

78
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,800
Okay, Ryota-kun, you can be the referee.

79
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:42,170
Huh? O-Okay.

80
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,800
Well, who wants to go first?

81
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,260
I will!

82
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:49,760
Oh-ho? So Kenya Misaki-kun is starting us off, eh?

83
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,180
We can use these?

84
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:54,890
Pick whichever one you like.

85
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:58,020
But if you lose, you have to start showing me some respect!

86
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:02,530
Hah! I've never lost to anyone but Shizu-sensei!

87
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:05,780
Save the big talk for after you beat me.

88
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:10,390
Now... Will this burn up some of the excess magicule energy

89
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:13,420
that'll otherwise destroy him someday?

90
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,790
B-Begin!

91
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,750
Wh-Why, you!

92
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:25,300
That's it! Go get him!

93
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:26,090
Don't lose!

94
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:28,300
Quit dodging!

95
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,560
You move pretty well, but you've got a ways to go!

96
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:43,930
These flames actually seem pretty weak.

97
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:47,820
Relative to the amount of energy within him, it's really inefficient.

98
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:50,710
Hey! Instead of relying on your flames,

99
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:52,870
try just striking with raw energy.

100
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:57,000
Shut up! The techniques Shizu-sensei used were awesome!

101
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,500
T-Time's up!

102
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:09,680
Well, that's it. You'd better call me "Sensei" from now on.

103
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,580
D-Damn it!

104
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:12,890
Who's next?

105
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:15,980
You'll pay for that!

106
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,450
Chloe Aubert-san.

107
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,520
Chlo-chi, don't push yourself too hard.

108
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,070
Don't get hurt, Chlo-chan!

109
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:30,750
I feel like I've seen her somewhere before...

110
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:32,540
She's so familiar...

111
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:33,580
Begin!

112
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:37,900
Is she gonna hit me with the corner of that book?

113
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:38,960
Surely not...

114
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:43,920
Flow of water, ensnare my enemy.

115
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,130
Water Jail!

116
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:52,220
Ah, she can use magic, too?

117
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:00,640
Impressive. Could she be a prodigy?

118
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:04,310
I can make blades of water rain down on you from there.

119
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:08,680
If you admit defeat, I'll cancel them.

120
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,610
If you don't, you'll die.

121
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,870
So young, yet so frightening!

122
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:16,660
Hey, what's the problem? Just admit defeat!

123
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:17,870
Nice, Chlo-chan!

124
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:18,850
G-Good job!

125
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:19,870
Well done!

126
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:22,759
This is certainly impressive magic.

127
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:27,170
But it won't work on me.

128
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:39,146
I can get out of that little trick easily with my extra skill Magic Manipulation.

129
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,840
You use this magic well.

130
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,032
Make sure you keep studying it.

131
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:50,530
Ack, she's crying...

132
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:51,970
You'll have to forgive me.

133
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:55,620
I needed to show the overwhelming difference in skill between us.

134
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:05,210
Don't hold it against me if you die.

135
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:10,800
Magic bullets, eh? And they're pretty powerful.

136
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:11,940
But!

137
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:16,850
Delicious. Thank you.

138
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:19,560
What was that?! That was dirty!

139
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:22,180
Use any dirty trick necessary to win.

140
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:24,060
That's just what grown-ups do.

141
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:29,140
Ryota Sekiguchi-kun.

142
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:33,820
He seems a bit timid. The polar opposite of Kenya, I'd say.

143
00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:36,570
Ryota! Avenge me!

144
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,580
Body Enhancement?

145
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:49,400
No, maybe that's Berserker...

146
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:03,020
Nice strength enhancement.

147
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:07,240
Up against anyone but me, he might've put up a good fight.

148
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:12,400
But you lose major points for abandoning your composure in battle.

149
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:24,420
Looks like it's finally my turn!

150
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:31,110
You useless losers better take a good look at what Alice Rondo-sama can do!

151
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:33,508
Go!

152
00:09:33,508 --> 00:09:36,880
Everyone! Take that jerk out!

153
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:42,600
Puppetry? So she's a Golem Master, huh?

154
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:49,690
If she can fight this well with stuffed animals,

155
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:53,400
she could use dolls made from a special alloy as actual weapons!

156
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:58,580
This might be the strongest ability out of the five of them.

157
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,650
It's kinda annoying...

158
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:02,910
Maybe I'll just burn them all up.

159
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,290
Notice.

160
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:08,420
The probability that the individual Alice Rondo would cry is 100%.

161
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:09,920
Maybe not, then.

162
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:12,290
T-Time's up!

163
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:18,933
Hmm...

164
00:10:18,933 --> 00:10:23,100
Doesn't look like the energy in their bodies has been reduced at all.

165
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:26,730
Another option might be to separate it from them with Degenerate...

166
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:27,830
Answer.

167
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:31,730
The energy has fused with their souls and cannot be separated from them.

168
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:33,400
I see...

169
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:37,640
They don't have much time, but I'll just have to search for another way.

170
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:41,490
Okay, eyes on me!

171
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:46,750
As you have just learned through experience, I am strong!

172
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,630
And as such, I promise

173
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:52,380
to save all of you.

174
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:54,130
Save us?

175
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:57,630
Yeah. I swear it on this mask.

176
00:10:58,270 --> 00:11:00,440
Is that Shizu-sensei's?

177
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,390
It is.

178
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:04,040
When Shizu-san entrusted this to me,

179
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:06,890
I believe she also entrusted me with all of you.

180
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:11,730
All right. I'll trust you.

181
00:11:12,530 --> 00:11:14,230
Th-Then... I will, too.

182
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:17,850
I trusted you from the beginning.

183
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:20,370
Jeez, you guys...

184
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:21,740
Fine. I will, too.

185
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:26,870
You're right. I think we can trust this person, too.

186
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:30,250
All right!

187
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:32,626
Wait...

188
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:37,890
Shizu-san came to this world around the same time these kids did, right?

189
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:42,510
She said the Demon Lord Leon made Ifrit possess her...

190
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:45,240
Could that mean...

191
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,640
Um...

192
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:53,730
Are we clear? I'll save you, no matter what.

193
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:57,650
Shizu-san entrusted you to me, and I won't abandon you.

194
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,240
Thank you, Sensei!

195
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:04,840
"Sensei," huh? I like the sound of that.

196
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:09,200
You guys are my students!

197
00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:10,850
Huh?

198
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:12,970
Huh?

199
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:25,910
I used Warp Portal, which Vesta taught me, to visit Treyni-san.

200
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:36,300
If we can make superior spirits inhabit these kids, like Shizu-san and Ifrit,

201
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:39,920
it should be possible for them to control their energy.

202
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:46,870
Great Rimuru, what brings you here?

203
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,720
Hey, Treyni-san.

204
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:51,370
I wanted to ask you where superior spirits can be found.

205
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:53,050
Well...

206
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:55,560
There is a place called the Dwelling of Spirits,

207
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:58,380
which is ruled by the Queen of Spirits.

208
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:02,380
Oh! So if I go there, can I meet superior spirits?

209
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:05,220
Yes, but...

210
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:10,490
You see, there are several entrances,

211
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:14,010
but the one I know of has long since vanished.

212
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:14,954
Huh?!

213
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:21,060
The Queen of Spirits we once served passed away long ago.

214
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:24,020
As I have no connection with the current Queen of Spirits,

215
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:25,650
I am unsure where she resides.

216
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,220
I see...

217
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,460
I am truly sorry I could be of no help.

218
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:31,570
It's okay.

219
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:47,100
Don't worry. Just leave it all to me.

220
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:57,620
It's been a month since I became a teacher.

221
00:13:58,030 --> 00:14:01,560
I've spent that time trying to find where superior spirits live,

222
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,600
but I haven't found anything yet.

223
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:06,710
Today, we're having a picnic.

224
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:08,830
Everyone needs a break sometimes.

225
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:14,790
Now, before we have lunch, I think we should do a bit of combat training.

226
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:17,250
Aww!

227
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:20,190
Those who do their best will earn a reward.

228
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:21,890
That's...

229
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,960
The latest issue!

230
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:28,050
Oh, man! I wanna see what happens next!

231
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:31,670
Y-Yeah! The last issue left off right where it was getting good!

232
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:35,610
I'm gonna get it before any of you!

233
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:36,980
I like manga, too.

234
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:42,000
Well, I don't know much about Japanese manga and anime,

235
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,360
but that makes it even more intriguing!

236
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,840
So, who's going first?

237
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:46,740
Oh! Me! Me!

238
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:47,890
No, me!

239
00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:48,720
I will...

240
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,760
I will!

241
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:50,610
Me, too!

242
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:52,300
Please, let me!

243
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:54,910
Please! Please, Sensei!

244
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:58,490
Damn... I lost again today...

245
00:14:58,490 --> 00:15:01,080
Sensei, you're so strong, it should be illegal.

246
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:04,480
Hey! You're supposed to go easy on girls!

247
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,550
I need to learn more magic...

248
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:08,970
I guess we're just no match for him!

249
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:17,350
Look, kiddos. You're dreaming if you think you can ever surpass me.

250
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:18,850
Boo! Boo!

251
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:20,350
Boo! Boo!

252
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:25,610
Well, you all tried hard, though, so I'll let you...

253
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:28,610
Sensei?

254
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:36,370
What is this pressure?

255
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:37,430
Notice.

256
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:40,270
High-density energy detected.

257
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:42,870
This response is a Sky Dragon.

258
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:44,880
Sky Dragon?

259
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:58,950
What was that? A stray Dragon?

260
00:15:58,950 --> 00:16:00,520
It was heading toward the capital!

261
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:03,650
Oh, well. I'd better go help them.

262
00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:04,590
Huh?

263
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:09,570
If we let that thing run free, a lot of people could get hurt.

264
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:12,820
Ranga, stay here and protect these guys.

265
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:17,610
Master, shall I go and give that thing a good chomping?

266
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:19,450
No, I'll go this time.

267
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:22,960
I have to put on a good show for these kids.

268
00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:24,230
I see.

269
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:25,540
Sensei!

270
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:27,900
I know you're strong,

271
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:29,770
but you can't beat a Dragon!

272
00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:30,730
Yeah!

273
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:34,550
If you die, who's going to save our lives?

274
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:38,380
I'm not stupid enough to go after anyone I can't defeat!

275
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:40,110
Just leave this to me!

276
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:41,600
Sensei!

277
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,600
Sensei!

278
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:45,560
Hang on to this for me!

279
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:50,940
No fair, Chlo-chan!

280
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:57,950
H-He flew!

281
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:59,490
Amazing...

282
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,590
They'll know who I am if I go in like this...

283
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:07,920
This'll do.

284
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:25,860
Aim!

285
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:27,810
Fire!

286
00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:49,210
Is this the end for me?

287
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:58,280
U-Unbelievable!

288
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:00,750
He completely wiped out a Sky Dragon's lightning attack!

289
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:02,600
Is that the Hero?!

290
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:07,600
Compared to Charybdis, this is nothing!

291
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:29,120
An invitation to dinner?

292
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:32,380
Yes, a merchant named Mjolmire

293
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:36,030
is quite keen on inviting you to the store he runs.

294
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:38,380
He said the children can come along, too.

295
00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:40,490
And why is this guy inviting me?

296
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:44,340
He said a mysterious warrior saved his life today.

297
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:48,640
It was you who defeated the Sky Dragon, wasn't it?

298
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:51,600
Was it, now?

299
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,960
So, this... Myo...

300
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,350
Mjolmire.

301
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:56,650
Yeah, him. Is he trustworthy?

302
00:18:56,650 --> 00:19:00,230
He has earned the official merchant certification issued by the Kingdom of Blumund

303
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:01,830
and the Free Union.

304
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:05,410
Of course, he also works as a loan shark out of the public eye...

305
00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:09,910
But I ran a background check on him. He can be trusted.

306
00:19:10,130 --> 00:19:11,030
Hmm...

307
00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:19,340
Wow!

308
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:20,700
It's so good!

309
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:22,300
This is fantastic!

310
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:23,960
What is this? It's so good!

311
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:24,720
Uh-huh!

312
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:28,850
What do you think?

313
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:31,690
Yes, it's quite good.

314
00:19:31,930 --> 00:19:34,460
Of course it is, of course it is!

315
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:37,450
I procured that via a particularly special route!

316
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:39,190
Go on, pour him some more!

317
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:47,010
You're sure you don't mind feeding my students, too?

318
00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:51,210
Not at all, not at all! I owe you my life, after all!

319
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:53,370
What do you mean?

320
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:58,090
I get information from all over the place, you know.

321
00:19:58,090 --> 00:20:03,890
Even with a different appearance, I know very well that was you.

322
00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:11,140
And I must show my gratitude to my savior or incur Heaven's wrath!

323
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:16,900
So, shall we say that we're even now?

324
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:19,210
I get it.

325
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:23,150
This guy seems trustworthy enough as a merchant.

326
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:25,810
By the way, Mjolmire-kun,

327
00:20:25,810 --> 00:20:29,830
with that information network of yours, you must know who I am, right?

328
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:31,420
Correct.

329
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:35,040
Then why don't you come to our town?

330
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:37,840
Go to... your town?

331
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:42,120
We intend to sell all kinds of things, but we lack the know-how.

332
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:44,590
If we had your help...

333
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:49,800
So we would both profit... I mean, benefit!

334
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,230
Very well.

335
00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:54,730
Then, it's settled.

336
00:20:57,890 --> 00:21:01,730
Right... I have the invitation to your town.

337
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:06,240
Come visit me again. I'll cut some great deals just for you!

338
00:21:06,930 --> 00:21:08,630
But not for free, right?

339
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:13,730
May the blessing of the Queen of Spirits safeguard these children.

340
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,540
Is that a magic spell?

341
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:21,240
It's a prayer we say in my homeland.

342
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:25,880
It means the Queen of Spirits, who lives in the Dwelling of Spirits, will protect you.

343
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,180
E-Excuse me, miss!

344
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,630
Did you just say "the Dwelling of Spirits"?

345
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:31,820
Do you know where that is?

346
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:35,020
Huh? Yes, I do...

347
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:37,940
I come from a village near there.

348
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:45,490
In exchange for a handsome tip, the lady told me where to go...

349
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:52,230
The Ulg Nature Park, in the northern part of a frontier nation called the Republic of Ulgrasia.

350
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:58,200
This is where the Dwelling of Spirits is...

351
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:03,760
Shizu-san, I swear I'm going to save these kids.

352
00:22:05,513 --> 00:22:12,394
I have to believe in me that you believe in

353
00:22:12,394 --> 00:22:20,858
A story just started, carrying a name

354
00:22:22,326 --> 00:22:29,050
Whether it's a concidence or a fate, who cares?

355
00:22:29,050 --> 00:22:34,787
Just pick one thing in here

356
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:42,242
Just from one chance, the future would change

357
00:22:42,242 --> 00:22:48,737
Along with the sky, the wind, and the land

358
00:22:48,737 --> 00:22:55,762
It's all because you keep believing in that possiblity

359
00:22:55,762 --> 00:23:02,315
That I can also keep believing. With my power...

360
00:23:02,315 --> 00:23:05,643
In the depths of the world that we must protect,

361
00:23:05,643 --> 00:23:08,997
rise up as many times as it take

362
00:23:08,997 --> 00:23:15,064
If I can't hold it with both hands, I'll lend it to you

363
00:23:15,674 --> 00:23:22,368
Even if you got shaken, face foward for the smile you wish to protect

364
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:27,294
There's a scenary I want to show you,

365
00:23:27,294 --> 00:23:29,815
let's go togehter

366
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:38,750
Next time, "Conquering the Labyrinth."
