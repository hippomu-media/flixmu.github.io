1
00:00:00,447 --> 00:00:05,168
Beyond a Fiction that nobody knows,

2
00:00:05,168 --> 00:00:10,523
here I open a nameless Story!

3
00:00:23,394 --> 00:00:28,030
The sky above holds a tomorrow brimming with hope

4
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:33,355
My days were vauge as I'm wondering What's the name?

5
00:00:33,355 --> 00:00:37,919
It took my far-reaching dream that kept me standing in awe

6
00:00:37,919 --> 00:00:43,079
along with my despair and consume them all away

7
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:47,534
My voice has been engraved by the shape of my wish

8
00:00:47,534 --> 00:00:52,051
Make it stronger, stronger, even stronger!

9
00:00:52,051 --> 00:00:55,205
Fly high!

10
00:00:56,906 --> 00:01:01,928
Beyond a Fiction that nobody knows,

11
00:01:01,928 --> 00:01:06,960
There's a slowly sprouting impulse of Skill to stay alive

12
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:11,823
If what I feel right now is Reality, then it will surely be a proof someday

13
00:01:11,823 --> 00:01:16,742
Each one of your story, I shall give a name to it

14
00:01:16,742 --> 00:01:22,053
to the east, to the west, to the high stand up to the period!

15
00:01:22,053 --> 00:01:24,645
Let's go!

16
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:41,810
There's no sign that the Eastern Empire is trying to cross the Great Forest of Jura.

17
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,740
Not yet, at least.

18
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:49,860
Our intelligence bureau is continuing to monitor them.

19
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:54,210
So, how did it go in the Great Forest of Jura?

20
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,160
It was a disaster!

21
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:59,570
Can't you even say you're glad we came back in one piece?

22
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:02,010
Let's hear your report.

23
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:05,850
Seriously? We just got back.

24
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:08,480
I really want a bath...

25
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:10,390
You think you two had it rough?

26
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:15,070
I had to listen to you squabbling the whole time.

27
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:18,370
Um...

28
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:25,680
While in the cave, we confirmed Veldora's disappearance.

29
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,019
We then searched the cave, but we found nothing.

30
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:29,800
Nothing?

31
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,330
No, nothing.

32
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:35,340
I'm now clear on what happened in the cave.

33
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:36,660
Then we'll just be—

34
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:38,240
I'll give you three days off.

35
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,312
Huh?

36
00:02:39,312 --> 00:02:42,800
Next, instead of the cave, you'll investigate around the forest.

37
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:47,680
The monsters may be more active with Veldora gone.

38
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,100
Don't overlook any changes, no matter how small.

39
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:52,970
Be thorough. Search every nook and cranny.

40
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,510
You may go.

41
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,530
"You may go," my ass!

42
00:02:57,530 --> 00:02:59,400
Why only three days?!

43
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,840
Give us a longer break!

44
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:03,280
We just got back, you know!

45
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:09,960
I wish you would've said all this to the guildmaster.

46
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:13,230
-That stupid old geezer! -Give us a longer break!

47
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:16,910
We have to go back to that forest?

48
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:20,550
Jeez, can't we do anything but complain? It's making me feel worse.

49
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,250
I want my bath...

50
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:23,371
Excuse me.

51
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:31,230
Who are you?

52
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:34,580
Did you not say you are going to the Great Forest of Jura?

53
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,510
What if we did?

54
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:39,860
Would you allow me to accompany you through the forest?

55
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:42,800
Sure!

56
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,640
Hey!

57
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,370
I'm the leader! You can't give the okay before I do!

58
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:48,900
Why not?

59
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:51,845
Traveling is best with companions, and life is best with compassion.

60
00:03:51,845 --> 00:03:54,860
Eren, Kaval, and Gido.

61
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:57,380
Shizu.

62
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,500
Welcome aboard, Shizu!

63
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,040
Sheesh...

64
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,180
We leave in three days.

65
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:06,050
If that's okay with you, come along if you want.

66
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,700
I appreciate it.

67
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:20,340
Ready, Ranga. Watch closely.

68
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:21,349
I shall!

69
00:04:21,349 --> 00:04:24,150
Rimuru, transform!

70
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:34,000
And now... Black Lightning!

71
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:48,230
Wow.

72
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:55,230
I thought I'd try out the new skill I just learned,

73
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:59,150
but I'll have to be careful how I use it. It could be too powerful.

74
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,280
Black Lightning...

75
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,930
You never cease to amaze, Master!

76
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:13,960
Ah... Everything's so peaceful.

77
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,900
Uh-huh. Looks like they're doing great.

78
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:23,930
A few weeks had passed since Rimuru returned from Dwargon with Kaijin

79
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:25,750
and the other dwarves.

80
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:33,050
Strike while the iron's hot, as we say!

81
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:38,400
There's the blacksmith, Kaijin, with expert smithing skills...

82
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,800
The oldest of the three dwarf brothers, Garm, an armor smith...

83
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,530
Tanning hides makes them more durable.

84
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:53,990
The middle brother, Dord, whose craftsmanship is the finest among all dwarves...

85
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,090
And the youngest brother, Myrd,

86
00:05:57,090 --> 00:06:00,040
whose skill with his hands makes him an expert in architecture and the arts.

87
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:03,360
With their guidance,

88
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,250
Rimuru and the Goblins were well on their way to building a new village.

89
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,720
When we first came back from Dwargon,

90
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:14,640
I was a little surprised to see what had happened...

91
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:18,390
Uh, Rigurd... What is this?

92
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,670
They all heard the rumors about you

93
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:24,530
and came here from the nearby Goblin villages to seek protection.

94
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:25,700
O-Oh...

95
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:29,450
Welcome home, Great Rimuru!

96
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:33,990
Great Sage, how many of them are there?

97
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:36,540
Answer: approximately 500.

98
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:37,709
Fi—

99
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:42,500
I thought about asking them to leave, but...

100
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,800
What will happen if I turn them away?

101
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:48,800
Due to the disappearance of the Storm Dragon, Veldora,

102
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:52,120
Orcs, Lizardmen, Ogres,

103
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:56,930
and other intelligent monster races are vying for dominance in the Great Forest of Jura.

104
00:06:57,330 --> 00:07:00,250
The unevolved Goblins will likely be eliminated.

105
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:02,210
You answered that so easily...

106
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:05,820
All right. Come with us, all who want to.

107
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:12,490
So Rimuru named all 500 of the Goblins...

108
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,760
and spent three days asleep again.

109
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:20,670
I wasn't sure how it'd work out,

110
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:24,190
but it's starting to look like they'll all be able to live here.

111
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:26,160
Good job, Kaijin!

112
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:30,050
All right! I'll show you how it's done!

113
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:45,810
Whoa! He summoned one!

114
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:48,850
There you have it.

115
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:50,570
Give it a try, all of you!

116
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:55,070
Gobta is teaching the newbies how to summon a Tempest Wolf.

117
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:58,580
Never knew Gobta had it in him...

118
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:03,040
When Rimuru nearly left Gobta behind in the Dwarven Kingdom...

119
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:07,790
He prayed with all his might for help.

120
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:09,060
And when he did...

121
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,930
he succeeded in summoning his wolf.

122
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:19,310
He then rode the wolf out of the kingdom,

123
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:24,130
rejoined Rimuru's party, and made it back to the village safely.

124
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:28,570
I guess that boy can do things when he really tries.

125
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:33,170
Rimuru's opinion of Gobta went up several levels after that.

126
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:35,680
That won't work.

127
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:38,580
You've gotta be more like, "Unnnngh"...

128
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:41,480
And then, "Pop!" Like that!

129
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:45,690
He's not the greatest teacher, though.

130
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:49,790
Rimuru's opinion of Gobta went down several levels after that.

131
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:52,590
Great Rimuru!

132
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:55,220
Rigurd.

133
00:08:56,020 --> 00:09:00,600
By the way, Rigurd was promoted from Goblin Lord to Goblin King.

134
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:04,290
He's the leader of all the other village elders who joined us.

135
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:06,350
Frankly, they threw the job at him.

136
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:15,260
It seems like becoming the Goblin King made him evolve even further...

137
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,660
Is something up?

138
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:21,150
Yes, sir! We received a message from Rigur and the security team.

139
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:23,830
It seems they've discovered suspicious beings in the forest.

140
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:25,340
Monsters?

141
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:27,370
No, humans.

142
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:28,330
Humans?

143
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:32,750
They may be scouts from some nation hoping to expand its dominion.

144
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:35,130
Hmm...

145
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:44,690
This is your fault, Kaval!

146
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:47,350
You just had to stab a Giant Ant nest with your sword!

147
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:50,250
Shut up! Don't complain about your leader!

148
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:52,330
For a leader, you're way too careless!

149
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:55,530
If I die, I swear I'll come back to haunt you!

150
00:09:56,770 --> 00:09:58,430
That's not even possible!

151
00:09:58,430 --> 00:09:59,660
Because...

152
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:02,220
I'd be dying with you!

153
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:08,080
-Shizu! -No, don't!

154
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:13,610
W-Wow...

155
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:17,125
Shizu, that one's still—

156
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:26,805
Shizu!

157
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:35,720
Shizu!

158
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:38,440
Are you okay?

159
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,840
Y-Yes.

160
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:42,270
What the heck was that?

161
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:44,430
It looked like... black lightning.

162
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:47,700
I guess Black Lightning really is too strong.

163
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,510
Better not use it, either.

164
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:57,400
A slime?

165
00:11:57,610 --> 00:12:00,300
Yeah. Got a problem with slimes?

166
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:01,900
Uh, no...

167
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:04,010
I just never knew slimes could talk.

168
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,910
I can't believe it.

169
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,730
Here, miss. This is yours, isn't it?

170
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:11,260
Sorry about that. You weren't hurt, were you?

171
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:16,420
No, I'm all right.

172
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:22,800
I met her sooner than I expected...

173
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:27,100
You saved me. Thank you.

174
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,270
The one I'm destined to be with.

175
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,330
What are those four up to?

176
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:34,480
Well...

177
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:37,180
Hey, damn it! I wanted that meat!

178
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:41,050
What a jerk! I raised that meat myself, you know!

179
00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:44,950
Listen, man! I won't yield when it comes to food!

180
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:47,960
I'm sorry...

181
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:50,490
They said they were starving, so I gave them food.

182
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:52,640
Hey, that's great!

183
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:55,750
Helping those in need is a good thing!

184
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:58,230
Yes, sir! Thank you very much!

185
00:12:58,230 --> 00:13:00,650
I hope to dedicate myself to doing just that!

186
00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:01,800
Good, good.

187
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,130
Great Rimuru, go on in.

188
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:10,350
Now that I really look at them, I feel like I've seen them before...

189
00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:11,600
Answer.

190
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:14,850
They are the trio you encountered in the cave.

191
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,770
Oh, right. Those guys.

192
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:28,280
Eating with her mask on... This girl I'm destined to be with has some skills.

193
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:32,650
Guests, I fear we have little to offer,

194
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:34,920
but are you comfortable here?

195
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:37,450
Allow me to make introductions.

196
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,790
This is our master, the great Rimuru!

197
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:46,550
Master?

198
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:49,050
Got a problem with that?

199
00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:50,640
Uh, no...

200
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:54,560
We knew you were no ordinary slime, but we had no idea...

201
00:13:54,890 --> 00:13:56,650
That threw them for a loop.

202
00:13:56,650 --> 00:14:00,100
Maybe I should do something to show them I'm harmless.

203
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:03,880
Nice to meet you! I'm Rimuru the slime!

204
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,820
I'm not a bad slime!

205
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:08,700
Shizu?

206
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:11,980
Huh? Did she actually get that joke?

207
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,570
We apologize.

208
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:19,050
We never expected to be saved by a monster,

209
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:20,230
but we do appreciate it.

210
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:22,770
Oh, and thanks for the meat!

211
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:24,340
It's delicious!

212
00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:26,650
Th-Thanks for your help.

213
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:30,340
I didn't expect to find Goblins building a village here.

214
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:34,350
She sure moves at her own pace...

215
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:38,100
So, what brings you all the way out here?

216
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:42,510
I'm Kaval. For what it's worth, I'm the leader of this party.

217
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:43,260
This is...

218
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:44,720
I'm Eren!

219
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,750
Hello. I'm Gido. Nice to meet you.

220
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:52,370
And this is a temporary member who just happened to be going the same way as us.

221
00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:55,088
Shizu.

222
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:58,440
The one I'm destined to be with is named Shizu, huh?

223
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:02,980
I guess she really is Japanese. She's sitting seiza-style, even.

224
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:04,590
And?

225
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:08,160
We're here at the request of the Guildmaster in the Kingdom of Blumund.

226
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:13,980
Kaval told me all of their plans, as if he'd never learned to suspect anyone.

227
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:20,410
A Guildmaster in Blumund, one of the nations bordering the Great Forest of Jura,

228
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:22,150
asked them to investigate the area.

229
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,650
I see.

230
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:29,650
Looks like Veldora's absence is having a greater effect than I realized.

231
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:34,490
People are coming to check out not just the cave, but all the surrounding area.

232
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:39,580
As you can see, we're in the middle of building our village,

233
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:42,920
but, well... does the Guild have some problem with that?

234
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:46,070
I don't think so. Right?

235
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:47,440
Yeah.

236
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,810
It's nothing the Guild has any say in.

237
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:51,530
What about the country, though?

238
00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:54,180
I have no idea, myself.

239
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:57,280
I see. Well, I get it now.

240
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:01,210
You should stay here tonight and get some good rest.

241
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:02,980
Thank you!

242
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:04,820
Treat them well.

243
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:05,640
Yes, sir!

244
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:18,480
Do you have a minute?

245
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:26,390
There's something I'd like to ask you.

246
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:28,430
Are you, um, from Japa—

247
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:31,530
Slime-san, that line you said was from a game, wasn't it?

248
00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:32,513
Huh?

249
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,640
"I'm not a bad slime."

250
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:44,040
I've never played it, but I heard about it from someone else from my country.

251
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,230
Yeah!

252
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:51,020
I've been held by so many women since I took this form!

253
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:52,930
One of the side perks, I guess!

254
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:55,760
Are you from Japan, too?

255
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:56,660
Yeah.

256
00:16:58,550 --> 00:16:59,640
I see.

257
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,530
I'm glad I met you.

258
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,490
How did you come here?

259
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:09,810
Actually, I was stabbed to death.

260
00:17:09,810 --> 00:17:10,960
Stabbed?

261
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:14,100
And the next thing I knew, I had this magnificent form!

262
00:17:14,610 --> 00:17:18,040
I see. So you were reincarnated.

263
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,360
That must've been hard.

264
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:22,220
Was it different for you?

265
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:27,950
I'm... a Summon.

266
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:29,800
A Summon...

267
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:33,490
That's right. Veldora talked about that.

268
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:38,040
It takes more than 30 mages to perform a ritual that lasts several days

269
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,740
to bring one here from another world.

270
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:44,280
They're also expected to serve as powerful weapons.

271
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:47,160
Magic is used to carve a curse into the Summon's soul

272
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:49,750
to ensure that the Summon can't defy the Summoner.

273
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:54,440
So... Shizu-san is a weapon?

274
00:17:55,210 --> 00:17:57,500
And the curse...

275
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:01,630
I'm curious, but this probably isn't the time to ask.

276
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:06,050
So when were you summoned here?

277
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,360
A long time ago.

278
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:12,270
My town was burning, engulfed in flames...

279
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:14,310
A war?

280
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:17,050
Bombs fell from the sky...

281
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:19,020
The air raids...

282
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:21,940
My mother and I fled together,

283
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:23,600
but then...

284
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,460
What happened to her?

285
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:29,610
I'm sorry.

286
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:31,100
It's okay.

287
00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:37,490
Hey, I know! I'll show you something fun!

288
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:39,050
Something fun?

289
00:18:39,850 --> 00:18:42,100
Great Sage, I'd like to use Thought Communication

290
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:44,810
to show Shizu-san some of my memories.

291
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:45,940
Understood.

292
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:47,060
Here we go!

293
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,110
An elf?

294
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:02,700
No, no! It's not... It's not like that!

295
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:04,080
She was pretty.

296
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,450
Pretend you never saw that! Look at this one!

297
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:27,350
Wow...

298
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:32,040
It's like the skyscrapers of New York that I saw on a picture postcard once.

299
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:35,230
After the war ended, peace came to Japan.

300
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:37,360
The towns and the economy all boomed.

301
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:40,370
I see... I'm so glad.

302
00:19:42,050 --> 00:19:44,620
I wish I could have shown my mother this.

303
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:51,180
I want to make this world one where everyone can live in peace, too.

304
00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:54,920
That's wonderful. I hope it really happens.

305
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:57,120
It will! I'm sure of it!

306
00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:05,460
Shizu-san?

307
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:09,570
I'm sorry.

308
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:11,030
Are you okay?

309
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:14,730
Yes, I think so.

310
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:19,280
Hey, Rimuru!

311
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:21,440
Got a minute?

312
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:26,270
We'd like to talk to you about where to build a new house.

313
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:27,120
Sure.

314
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,520
See you later.

315
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:29,505
See you.

316
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,530
Was I interrupting?

317
00:20:33,530 --> 00:20:34,640
Shut up!

318
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,940
Now, don't be shy.

319
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:37,120
I'm not!

320
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,850
But you're blushing.

321
00:20:57,860 --> 00:20:59,070
Mommy!

322
00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:00,230
Mommy!

323
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:23,670
Another failure.

324
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:27,540
H-Help...

325
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:39,650
I thought she was useless, but she may have an affinity for fire.

326
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:48,980
Ifrit, I offer her body to you.

327
00:21:50,170 --> 00:21:51,560
Use it well.

328
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:22,950
Why is it only those who have hope

329
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:28,447
To fall into despair from the bottom of their heart?

330
00:22:28,447 --> 00:22:33,371
Why is it only those who have courage

331
00:22:33,371 --> 00:22:39,313
To be wounded at the end of their honor?

332
00:22:39,313 --> 00:22:45,030
I don't want to close my eyes in face of sadness

333
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:50,659
The dawn for new tomorrow was a mere dream to me

334
00:22:50,659 --> 00:22:56,431
Then I see a light falling through the crack of the night

335
00:22:56,431 --> 00:23:02,882
The sky is crying

336
00:23:03,387 --> 00:23:08,951
I don't know what is there at the corner of the world

337
00:23:08,951 --> 00:23:14,567
All I want is to protect those within my reach

338
00:23:14,567 --> 00:23:20,786
Staring at the only reason to fight

339
00:23:20,786 --> 00:23:27,972
We who believe the answer to be forgiveness...

340
00:23:27,972 --> 00:23:32,726
Must not lose!

341
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:38,630
Next time, "Conqueror of Flames."
