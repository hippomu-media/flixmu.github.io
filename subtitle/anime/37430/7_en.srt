1
00:00:00,447 --> 00:00:05,168
Beyond a Fiction that nobody knows,

2
00:00:05,168 --> 00:00:10,523
here I open a nameless Story!

3
00:00:23,394 --> 00:00:28,030
The sky above holds a tomorrow brimming with hope

4
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:33,355
My days were vauge as I'm wondering What's the name?

5
00:00:33,355 --> 00:00:37,919
It took my far-reaching dream that kept me standing in awe

6
00:00:37,919 --> 00:00:43,079
along with my despair and consume them all away

7
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:47,534
My voice has been engraved by the shape of my wish

8
00:00:47,534 --> 00:00:52,051
Make it stronger, stronger, even stronger!

9
00:00:52,051 --> 00:00:55,205
Fly high!

10
00:00:56,906 --> 00:01:01,928
Beyond a Fiction that nobody knows,

11
00:01:01,928 --> 00:01:06,960
There's a slowly sprouting impulse of Skill to stay alive

12
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:11,823
If what I feel right now is Reality, then it will surely be a proof someday

13
00:01:11,823 --> 00:01:16,742
Each one of your story, I shall give a name to it

14
00:01:16,742 --> 00:01:22,053
to the east, to the west, to the high stand up to the period!

15
00:01:22,053 --> 00:01:24,645
Let's go!

16
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,870
The great sorcerer Koenig has come to pay his respects!

17
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:24,740
Leon!

18
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:28,370
I will defeat you and become the Demon Lord myself!

19
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:30,330
You can die with your mind at ease!

20
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:34,860
Who sent a lowly creature like you here?

21
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:37,430
Still, this is a fine opportunity.

22
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:40,830
Your turn has come, Ifrit.

23
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:43,020
What's the matter?

24
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:51,150
You're ignoring me?! You'll regret underestimating me!

25
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:56,650
Oh, you want to die first?

26
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:58,190
Very well!

27
00:02:58,190 --> 00:02:59,860
Go ahead and die!

28
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:19,970
Very interesting.

29
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:25,220
What did you say your name was?

30
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:28,870
Shizu...e.

31
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:31,320
Shizu E?

32
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:32,953
Hm...

33
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:35,750
As of today, you will be called Shizu.

34
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:37,890
Shizu...

35
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:50,230
Eats lots, okay?

36
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,790
I-It got separated from its mother...

37
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:01,760
P-Please pretend you didn't see this!

38
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:04,820
I won't tell anyone.

39
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,260
Can I take care of it with you?

40
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:11,640
Yes, of course!

41
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:16,250
He's eating!

42
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,730
So what's his name?

43
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:23,650
Monsters don't have names.

44
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:26,160
But it's sad to have no name to go by.

45
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,330
See? He agrees.

46
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,450
How about Pizu?

47
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:35,490
Pizu... That sounds good!

48
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:37,210
Right, Pizu?

49
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:43,390
Look! He got bigger!

50
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:46,470
You got bigger!

51
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:52,700
Pirino, you know you can't take Pizu to the castle.

52
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:55,480
It'll be fine. He's really smart!

53
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:57,310
But...

54
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:59,240
He's really friendly with me.

55
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,650
I'm sure they'll let him be my familiar.

56
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:05,320
You think so?

57
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:09,410
What's wrong, Pizu?

58
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,690
It's okay... Come on, it's okay!

59
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:13,780
Just calm down!

60
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:17,420
Be good, now... Pizu!

61
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:22,920
It's okay... It's okay.

62
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:28,900
Shizu...

63
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:32,699
Enemy.

64
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:52,870
What... did I just...

65
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,820
M-My body...

66
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:59,170
My body moved on its own...

67
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:01,260
The flames...

68
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:04,900
I... I...

69
00:06:56,970 --> 00:07:00,070
So, do you like our town?

70
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:06,230
Yes, very much.

71
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:10,880
You're welcome to stay as long as you'd like, Shizu-san.

72
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,580
Thank you...

73
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:15,140
but I have to go.

74
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:16,310
You do?

75
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:20,370
If I stay here, I might bring trouble for you.

76
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:26,420
The goal of my journey is...

77
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:27,920
Goal?

78
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:32,720
...to find the man who summoned me.

79
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,070
What will you do when you find him?

80
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:45,940
Well, okay!

81
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:48,530
It's too bad, but you can come visit anytime!

82
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:50,810
You'll always be welcome! Right, Ranga?

83
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:51,990
Of course!

84
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:54,330
Okay. Thank you.

85
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,700
Thank you, too, Ranga.

86
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:11,720
Shizu, why don't you come back to Blumund with us?

87
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:12,817
Huh?

88
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:16,030
It'd be awfully sad to say goodbye here.

89
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:19,710
You're all exceptional adventurers.

90
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:23,560
I'm sure it would be lots of fun adventuring with you.

91
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:25,100
Well, then...

92
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:32,240
Traveling together has shown me how nice it is to be part of a group.

93
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:36,870
I'm truly grateful my last journey was made with all of you.

94
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:40,620
Shizu, what do you mean by "last"?

95
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:43,550
I've been around for decades, you know.

96
00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:45,500
I'm not as young as I look.

97
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:50,250
Huh? O-Oh, you were just joking!

98
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:52,880
Gosh, don't scare me like that!

99
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:57,340
Ah, here they come.

100
00:08:57,930 --> 00:08:59,400
Sorry for the wait!

101
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,990
Oh, we waited, all right.

102
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:05,270
Jeez, why do women take so long to get ready?

103
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,190
Shizu?

104
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,360
Is something wrong?

105
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:24,710
Not... again...

106
00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:26,080
Shizu?

107
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,210
Hey, what's wrong with you?

108
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,717
Shizu!

109
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:42,400
Shizu! Shizu!

110
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:13,320
Hey! Is everyone okay?

111
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:15,110
What the hell is this?

112
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:17,300
We charge extra for hazard pay, you know!

113
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:20,180
You should be telling Fuze that!

114
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:22,430
Shizu! Shizu!

115
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:28,580
Shizu... Shizue Izawa?

116
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:29,140
Huh?

117
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:31,190
Isn't Shizue Izawa...

118
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:33,490
...the Conqueror of Flames?!

119
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:40,450
Y-You mean the hero of the guild from about 50 years ago?!

120
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:42,410
Shizu is her?

121
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:43,640
The Conqueror of...

122
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:47,580
Wasn't she retired already?

123
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,750
Rigurd, Rigur.

124
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,300
Evacuate the others.

125
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:56,630
But...

126
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:57,900
Great Rimuru...

127
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:59,060
That's an order.

128
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:01,180
Yes, sir! As you wish!

129
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,290
Are you there, Ranga?

130
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Right here, Master.

131
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:10,670
Once it starts, you're up.

132
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:11,560
Of course!

133
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:38,470
The fire spirit, Ifrit...

134
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:41,590
There's no mistake, then. Shizu is...

135
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:45,220
...the legendary hero, the Conqueror of Flames.

136
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:48,630
Th-There's no way we can win if we have to fight that!

137
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:52,980
Not a chance. We're going to die here.

138
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:56,770
My life was so short...

139
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:23,340
Damn it! We just built all that!

140
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:25,380
Ouch...

141
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:27,350
You guys need to get out of here!

142
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:30,670
We can't do that.

143
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:39,020
I don't know why she's suddenly out for blood...

144
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,320
But she's one of us!

145
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:43,110
We can't just leave her!

146
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,590
All right. Just be careful.

147
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:48,160
They're really nice guys.

148
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:53,660
Never thought I'd see the day when I'd fight a legendary hero.

149
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:56,920
You never know what's going to happen in life.

150
00:12:58,450 --> 00:12:59,420
Let's go!

151
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:07,680
Hey! What is it you want?

152
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:14,680
Water Blade!

153
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:22,730
Yeah, I should've expected that.

154
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:29,130
Icicle Lance!

155
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:40,420
Hey, you doing okay?

156
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:42,050
Just leave this to us!

157
00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:45,880
We've put our lives on the line to be adventurers, you know!

158
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:48,660
Hey, gimme a break.

159
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:50,560
I'm the leader, remember?

160
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,290
Well, whatever.

161
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:54,020
We've got the first one!

162
00:13:54,530 --> 00:13:56,810
We're all in the same boat, as they say!

163
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:58,400
I'll leave you to it, then.

164
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,860
But don't overdo it.

165
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:01,480
Whoa!

166
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,600
Ranga!

167
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:07,850
Yes!

168
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:17,830
Ranga, here they come!

169
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:26,130
Just concentrate on evading them! I'll do the attacking!

170
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:27,840
Understood!

171
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:49,040
We need to take care of those guys before we can face Ifrit.

172
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:52,370
What to do? My Water Blade will just evaporate...

173
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:57,790
But what if I shoot all the water in my belly toward them at once?

174
00:14:58,150 --> 00:14:59,120
Answer.

175
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,440
Expulsion of great amounts of water is possible.

176
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:03,340
When it makes contact with a Salamander,

177
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:05,340
it will cause an explosion of steam.

178
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:06,800
Take this action?

179
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:08,860
An explosion of steam?

180
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:11,200
Will that destroy the Salamanders?

181
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,370
It is possible.

182
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:18,060
However, the force of the blast may destroy the surrounding area, as well.

183
00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:20,680
Well, what's the point in that, then?!

184
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,340
Icicle Lance!

185
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,740
Her attack is working, isn't it?

186
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:36,190
Magic attacks are effective against spirits.

187
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:37,960
Which means...

188
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,390
Ranga!

189
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:40,200
Yes!

190
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:46,000
Eren! Fire that attack at me!

191
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:49,880
What?! Um, I don't know if I can...

192
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,760
Just do it! Hurry!

193
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:54,260
Don't complain to me later!

194
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:58,260
Icicle Lance!

195
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:08,650
What?! My magic...

196
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,200
Notice.

197
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:13,150
Analysis of Icicle Lance successful.

198
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,338
All right!

199
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,510
Icicle Shotgun!

200
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:35,901
Yes!

201
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,980
I'll get that one, too—

202
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:50,570
It's gonna blow itself up!

203
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,580
Hey! Are you o—

204
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:03,620
Nope, they're not...

205
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:10,500
Ranga, get these three someplace safe.

206
00:17:10,690 --> 00:17:11,730
But...

207
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:12,680
Go!

208
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:15,170
As you command, Master.

209
00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:16,260
Please be well.

210
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:17,880
Don't worry.

211
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:21,780
I'll take down Ifrit.

212
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:37,530
Okay, now we can fight without holding back.

213
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:07,640
Take this! Icicle Shotgun!

214
00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:16,650
It's gonna work!

215
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,270
Master...

216
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:51,190
There should've been something else I could do!

217
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:55,190
I can't believe I fell into the enemy's trap!

218
00:18:55,600 --> 00:19:00,450
Instead of talking about seals, I should've hit them with Black Lightning!

219
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:03,720
And after I was just reincarnated here as a slime!

220
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:06,690
Is this really the end?!

221
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:08,920
It was a short life...

222
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,810
rather, a short slife.

223
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:17,050
Actually, I don't seem to be taking much damage.

224
00:19:18,050 --> 00:19:19,720
How long is it gonna take?

225
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,140
Is this some kind of tease?

226
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:22,870
Answer.

227
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:25,500
Due to "Thermal Fluctuation Resistance,"

228
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:28,890
fire attacks are being automatically nullified.

229
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:29,970
Ah.

230
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:31,190
Sigh...

231
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,740
Hey, why do you sound exasperated?!

232
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:38,070
Oh, well. If I can nullify fire attacks,

233
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:40,210
this'll be easy mode!

234
00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:42,140
It's all good!

235
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:44,450
In fact, everything is...

236
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:46,410
according to plan!

237
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:12,260
Did you just do something to me?

238
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:23,080
I underestimated you, but not as much as you underestimated me.

239
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:30,190
My turn.

240
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:36,340
Use unique skill "Predator"?

241
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,310
Yes!

242
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,540
Shizu-san!

243
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:21,170
Give up, Ifrit.

244
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:32,100
You cannot break out of this place.

245
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:39,050
You are no match for Rimuru.

246
00:21:39,430 --> 00:21:41,940
He is my sworn friend!

247
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:48,040
I am the Storm Dragon, Veldora Tempest.

248
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:51,320
It would be my pleasure to face you.

249
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:22,950
Why is it only those who have hope

250
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:28,447
To fall into despair from the bottom of their heart?

251
00:22:28,447 --> 00:22:33,371
Why is it only those who have courage

252
00:22:33,371 --> 00:22:39,313
To be wounded at the end of their honor?

253
00:22:39,313 --> 00:22:45,030
I don't want to close my eyes in face of sadness

254
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:50,659
The dawn for new tomorrow was a mere dream to me

255
00:22:50,659 --> 00:22:56,431
Then I see a light falling through the crack of the night

256
00:22:56,431 --> 00:23:02,882
The sky is crying

257
00:23:03,387 --> 00:23:08,951
I don't know what is there at the corner of the world

258
00:23:08,951 --> 00:23:14,567
All I want is to protect those within my reach

259
00:23:14,567 --> 00:23:20,786
Staring at the only reason to fight

260
00:23:20,786 --> 00:23:27,972
We who believe the answer to be forgiveness...

261
00:23:27,972 --> 00:23:32,726
Must not lose!

262
00:23:35,810 --> 00:23:38,470
Next time, "Inherited Will."
