1
00:00:10,424 --> 00:00:15,991
In the night you could count stars in the sky

2
00:00:15,991 --> 00:00:21,489
The overflown drop reflects the swaying world

3
00:00:21,489 --> 00:00:27,386
All life are in ambivalence

4
00:00:27,386 --> 00:00:32,182
And it twinkles as the days goes by

5
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:38,774
Both short-lived flowers and devastating winds

6
00:00:38,774 --> 00:00:43,026
are the sign of the passing present

7
00:00:43,821 --> 00:00:49,812
To those who live in the moment, this song shall reach you

8
00:00:49,812 --> 00:00:57,902
It will push you to the limits of freedom, telling you to survive

9
00:00:57,902 --> 00:01:00,677
We will find the way

10
00:01:00,677 --> 00:01:09,010
We returners all equally carry a seed of hope

11
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:15,513
Under the whim of miracle, Birth and Demise shall join hand

12
00:01:15,513 --> 00:01:19,572
and the time will flow once again

13
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,530
Now, do it!

14
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:34,820
Yes, sir!

15
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,700
Amazing! You're the best, Master!

16
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:47,790
One neatly filleted Megalodon!

17
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:53,300
A task simple enough to achieve before breakfast... or dinner, in this case.

18
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:56,660
It's so light...

19
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:58,550
And so hard.

20
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:00,540
I bet we could use this.

21
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:02,180
It'll make some nice weapons.

22
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:06,060
It could be a shield, too. Or we could even work it into some armor.

23
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:08,440
We could even make some simple accessories with it.

24
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:10,230
They'd fetch a high price for sure.

25
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:20,570
Geld, that was some splendid fighting!

26
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:22,799
Your courage set an example I'd like to follow!

27
00:02:22,799 --> 00:02:27,290
You were unstoppable yourself, Gabiru! I can't express my admiration enough!

28
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:29,080
Oh, no, Geld!

29
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,790
Oh, no, Gabiru!

30
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,790
You're both awesome!

31
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:37,400
With Charybdis no longer a threat,

32
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:40,050
peace returned to the city of Rimuru.

33
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:44,560
As an added windfall, the Demon Lord Carrion agreed to a non-aggression pact,

34
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,760
adding further stability to the foundation of the Jura Tempest Federation.

35
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:01,830
Sheesh... I'm really worn out after all this.

36
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:06,100
You were a big help, Milim. Thanks again.

37
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:09,720
It was nothing! It's only natural I'd do that much!

38
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,530
Feel free to thank me more!

39
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:13,710
You were really something yourself, Rimuru!

40
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:17,990
If you said you planned to become a Demon Lord, I'd have no objections!

41
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:21,700
A Demon Lord? You know I wouldn't become one of those.

42
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:23,340
Is there any merit to being one?

43
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:25,800
Merit?

44
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,100
Why did you become a Demon Lord?

45
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:32,060
Why did I?

46
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:35,480
Did something bad happen and make me become one out of frustration?

47
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:37,570
Uh, why are you asking me?

48
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:40,600
Good point! I can't really remember!

49
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:43,040
It was so long ago that I forgot!

50
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,090
I see.

51
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:44,952
Oh, yeah!

52
00:03:44,952 --> 00:03:46,608
I just thought of one merit!

53
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:53,477
It's because I became a Demon Lord that I found myself a bestie!

54
00:03:53,477 --> 00:03:54,960
R-Right...

55
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:03,000
Anyway, bestie, I need to get back to work now.

56
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,020
Work?

57
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:05,440
Right now?

58
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,220
That came out of nowhere.

59
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:09,680
Well, it doesn't mean I'll never see you again!

60
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:11,974
We'll only be apart for a little while!

61
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:14,290
Transform!

62
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:27,740
I'll be sure to tell the other Demon Lords not to mess with this place,

63
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:28,950
so don't worry about that!

64
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,830
You're going to see the other Demon Lords?

65
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:34,040
Indeed. That's my job!

66
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,010
Careful you don't let them trick you.

67
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:37,370
Please don't let them trick you.

68
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:38,550
Don't let them trick you.

69
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:40,120
Don't let them trick you, okay?

70
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,524
Make certain they do not trick you.

71
00:04:41,524 --> 00:04:43,840
You all worry too much!

72
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,000
They can't trick me! I'm too smart!

73
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:51,140
Well, I'm off! Fwoosh!

74
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,060
Hey, wait!

75
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:55,890
Oh. She's gone.

76
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:59,150
I envy how free-spirited she is.

77
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:02,090
That's so very like Lady Milim, though.

78
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:04,400
I look forward to seeing her again.

79
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:30,760
Please... save... those children...

80
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:35,180
Hurry... to the royal capital...

81
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:42,180
Huh?

82
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:51,850
That... wasn't just a dream.

83
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:54,040
It's the regret Shizu-san's clinging to, isn't it?

84
00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:59,840
So I retired and became an instructor.

85
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,310
An instructor?

86
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:03,460
A teacher at a school.

87
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:06,040
Oh! There are schools here?

88
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,260
Yes, in a place called the Kingdom of Ingrassia.

89
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,630
It was a school for kids from other worlds.

90
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:20,980
The royal capital of the Kingdom of Ingrassia, huh?

91
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:28,530
There's Benimaru...

92
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,110
Kaijin...

93
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:32,070
Rigur...

94
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:33,990
The Goblin riders...

95
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:36,910
Geld...

96
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:40,210
Rigurd...

97
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,790
And heck, even Gabiru.

98
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:47,240
They should be just fine without me for a while.

99
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:57,510
So that's why I'm planning to go to the Kingdom of Ingrassia.

100
00:06:57,810 --> 00:06:58,810
Those kids were one of the reasons

101
00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:03,066
why Shizu-san made up her mind to go see the Demon Lord Leon.

102
00:07:03,066 --> 00:07:05,360
And I promised Shizu-san, after all.

103
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:09,800
I understand what you're saying... but...

104
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,920
If anything should happen to you,

105
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:15,370
the Jura Forest Alliance could be ripped up from its very roots,

106
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:17,740
after it was only just beginning to come together.

107
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:20,110
I will go with him.

108
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:22,040
You can all rest at ease.

109
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:24,960
What Ranga said.

110
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:28,960
Work together to keep this town safe.

111
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:33,070
I need you all to fulfill your roles the best you can.

112
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:34,224
Yes, sir!

113
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,970
Well, I'm off.

114
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:40,920
P-Please, be well! We will await your return always!

115
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,450
Sir Gabiru, you're so sensitive!

116
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:43,980
Sir Gabiru, you're so kind!

117
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:46,730
Don't be so dramatic. I'll be back in no time.

118
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:49,600
Please do come back as soon as you can!

119
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,490
I pray you'll have a safe journey.

120
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:52,740
Later!

121
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:55,990
Farewell!

122
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:59,500
And so, I was on my way.

123
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:02,120
In the two years since I reincarnated here,

124
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:04,350
it's my first time visiting a nation of humans,

125
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:06,600
so I'm a little excited.

126
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:11,670
The Kingdom of Ingrassia lies to the west of our nation.

127
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:15,890
It's also the home of the headquarters of the organization set up to help adventurers,

128
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:18,100
the Free Union, which Fuze and his people belong to.

129
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:21,560
That's because its location is easily accessible from all nations.

130
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,260
The school where these kids are,

131
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:28,980
Freedom Academy, was established by one of Shizu-san's students.

132
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:32,420
That student's name is Yuuki Kagurazaka.

133
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:34,700
Based on the name, they must be Japanese...

134
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:36,630
My plan is to meet them first.

135
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:41,950
Fuze wrote a letter of introduction for me, so that won't be a problem.

136
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,170
Thanks to Ranga,

137
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:52,140
I arrived at the royal capital of Ingrassia in just three days.

138
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:57,920
Stay hidden in my shadow.

139
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:01,050
It'll cause a panic if you walk into the city like this.

140
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:04,800
Yes, Master. Feel free to call upon me at any time.

141
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,730
Take care.

142
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:06,590
Sure.

143
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:15,434
There was a strict identification policy for entering the capital.

144
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:19,650
Just in case there was a magic barrier to prevent monsters from entering,

145
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:22,360
I wore the magic-suppressing mask to conceal my aura.

146
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:26,300
It'd probably be trouble if they found out I'm a monster,

147
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:27,740
so it's just in case.

148
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,983
And, with the ID that Fuze prepared for me,

149
00:09:31,983 --> 00:09:34,250
I was able to enter the capital without issue.

150
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:43,774
Sorry...

151
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,640
There are so many people.

152
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:50,120
It's quite a departure from our little nation.

153
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,280
Definitely a big city.

154
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:55,219
Whoa, seriously?!

155
00:09:55,219 --> 00:09:56,610
Is that glass?

156
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:04,300
This is the biggest pane of glass I've seen since I came to this world.

157
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:08,580
This must be a church.

158
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:13,600
Wait... Don't churches consider monsters enemies?

159
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,360
Better make sure I don't get involved with that.

160
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:21,530
And that must be the Free Union headquarters.

161
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:29,400
Glass here, too... They definitely have money.

162
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:35,110
Automatic doors?!

163
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:40,840
I've verified your letter of introduction.

164
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:45,930
The Grandmaster has agreed to see you. I'll show you in.

165
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:47,520
Right this way.

166
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:48,450
Thanks.

167
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:57,130
We're teleporting? They must be worried about spies and stuff.

168
00:10:57,810 --> 00:10:59,930
Please wait here for a few moments.

169
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:09,140
Now... What will this Grandmaster be like?

170
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:19,100
Thank you for waiting.

171
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:21,390
Pleased to meet you.

172
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:25,370
I'm the Grandmaster, Yuuki Kaguraza... ka...

173
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:34,260
Nice to meet you, too. I'm Rimuru Tempest.

174
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:36,790
I'm the leader of the Jura Tempest Federation,

175
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:40,130
the nation of monsters in the Forest of Jura.

176
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:44,640
That mask... is Shizu-sensei's.

177
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,940
That's right. You know who I am, don't you?

178
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:53,310
I'm a slime that can mimic the appearance of monsters I eat.

179
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:57,740
Monsters you... eat?

180
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:11,370
Calm down, kid.

181
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:15,880
I'm not a bad slime.

182
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,944
That line...

183
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:23,220
I beat that game, too.

184
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,800
You taught it to Shizu-san, didn't you?

185
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,810
I'd like you to elaborate further on this.

186
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:32,820
That's why I'm here.

187
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:38,040
I see! So that's what happens in the last episode!

188
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:40,570
Wow, so Belldandy really...

189
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:44,520
Anything else you'd like to know?

190
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:46,910
By the time I got stabbed and died,

191
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:50,580
I'd finished just about all the manga and anime you know!

192
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:53,870
Naturally, I didn't miss a thing in that respect.

193
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:57,460
It's important to get the basics down. That's how a gentleman's gotta be.

194
00:12:57,660 --> 00:13:01,610
You amaze me, Master Rimuru! Please, please teach me!

195
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:05,090
What about games? How many FFs were they up to?

196
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,680
Nineteen.

197
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,290
That many?!

198
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:10,938
Anything else?

199
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:14,100
The Sagrada Família is almost finished.

200
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:15,600
Wow! Finally?!

201
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,600
And Iitomo ended.

202
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,940
Are you serious?!

203
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:21,940
What am I gonna be "Uki Uki Watching" every weekday afternoon now?!

204
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:23,860
BomBom is gone.

205
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:28,220
What?! I looked forward to those comics every month as a kid!

206
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:30,740
Hey! Is that one series finished yet? Glass Ma—

207
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:31,950
Nope, it's still going.

208
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:34,200
Still?! Then... Then what about The Five Sta—

209
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,960
Well, since each book has its own clear ending...

210
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:39,710
So it still hasn't ended?

211
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:43,050
I'd love to know how it's going to end myself.

212
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:46,050
As for the prime ministers we've had...

213
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:47,340
Oh, I don't care about that.

214
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:48,293
Huh?!

215
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:52,850
Still, that's incredible. I'm so happy.

216
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:56,280
Just hearing all this has been great,

217
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:59,600
but I wish I could've seen it all with my own eyes.

218
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,280
Your own eyes, huh?

219
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,510
Got any paper?

220
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,360
Paper?

221
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:09,400
Hang on a sec.

222
00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:11,740
Transform!

223
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:16,120
Oh! So this is your true form!

224
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,130
Here's a whole volume.

225
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:29,780
Wow! What magic did you use to make this, Master?!

226
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,140
That's a trade secret.

227
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:36,180
It was the result of using Great Sage's ability to the fullest.

228
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:40,400
I copied images from my own memory onto the paper I ingested.

229
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,760
Notice. This is a waste of my ability.

230
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:46,400
You fool! This is an extremely effective use of your ability!

231
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,150
Well, you'd better get me more paper,

232
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:51,290
if you want to read what comes next.

233
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:56,440
Thank you so much, Master!

234
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:59,790
Now, do you see that I'm not a bad slime?

235
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,560
Of course!

236
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:06,760
The news about Shizu-sensei is unfortunate,

237
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,500
but I trust you.

238
00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:12,930
I'll take my time reading these later.

239
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:17,410
So, what brought you here to see me?

240
00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:21,190
Are you looking for a way to go back home, perhaps?

241
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:23,310
No, it's not that...

242
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,690
but is it possible to go back?

243
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:31,200
Well, if it was, I'm sure you would've done it long ago.

244
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:35,770
I've given up on that. I've probably been cremated by now, anyway.

245
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:38,750
It sounds like you have no way back.

246
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:42,720
But I don't believe that it's impossible.

247
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:46,960
There were legends of ogres and demons in Japan,

248
00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:51,220
and every other nation has similar myths and stories, too.

249
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:54,170
So I figure that if some condition is met,

250
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:56,630
moving between our worlds should be possible.

251
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:58,730
I see...

252
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:02,260
If your goal wasn't to go back, then why are you here?

253
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,970
I'm more than happy to just live an easy life.

254
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:11,030
I built a town, and I intended to enjoy life with my friends there.

255
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:15,070
But there was something bothering me.

256
00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:17,080
What was bothering you?

257
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:19,830
Shizu-sensei's lingering regret.

258
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:25,500
I see. Shizu-sensei's regret...

259
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:28,590
The children of Freedom Academy.

260
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:32,590
If that is Shizu-sensei's wish, then...

261
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,250
Of course.

262
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:38,830
Rimuru-san, I'm also willing to entrust them to you.

263
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:44,230
Yuuki arranged for me to be a teacher at the school.

264
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:48,680
I'll be the one teaching Shizu-sensei's students now.

265
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:52,040
Incidentally, it comes with a dorm just for the teachers!

266
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,820
Three meals a day, too!

267
00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:55,740
My daily wage is ten silver coins.

268
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:57,660
The working conditions are pretty good!

269
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:03,040
Rimuru-san, do you know Hinata Sakaguchi?

270
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:05,260
Hinata Sakaguchi?

271
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:08,570
She was once a student of Shizu-sensei's.

272
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:09,950
Oh...

273
00:17:09,950 --> 00:17:13,750
The one who left Shizu-san?

274
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:14,690
Yes.

275
00:17:15,810 --> 00:17:21,440
In her prime, Shizu-sensei had complete control over the superior spirit Ifrit,

276
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:26,910
but Hinata gained strength surpassing hers at the age of fifteen.

277
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:28,914
Huh...

278
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,870
That alone should give you an idea of how strong she is.

279
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:37,070
Nope, not a clue. Better just keep my mouth shut.

280
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:42,330
You may wonder why I'm telling you about this...

281
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:45,660
I just want you to know the difference

282
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:48,800
between the Otherworlders, like Hinata and us,

283
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:51,160
who came to this world spontaneously,

284
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:54,100
and those five students, the Summons.

285
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:55,340
Summons?

286
00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:57,960
Veldora mentioned that...

287
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:00,610
A Summon?

288
00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:02,850
Is that different from Otherworlders?

289
00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:07,310
It takes more than 30 mages to perform a ritual that lasts several days

290
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:09,100
to bring one here from another world.

291
00:18:09,370 --> 00:18:12,800
They're also expected to serve as powerful weapons.

292
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:13,950
Weapons?

293
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:15,790
Yes, for the Summoner.

294
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:18,650
Magic is used to carve a curse into the Summon's soul

295
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:21,370
to ensure that the Summon can't defy the Summoner.

296
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:26,060
Since Summons are brought here for some specific purpose,

297
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:29,870
they're always given power suited to that purpose.

298
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:34,540
Just like the Hero who may become mankind's trump card, in fact.

299
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:40,390
When crossing worlds, one is given a new body.

300
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:43,070
At that time, the body takes in a massive amount of energy

301
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:45,390
and begins to acquire abilities.

302
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:51,230
When a summoning is performed, there are times when a child is summoned.

303
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:54,558
And when an amount of energy too vast

304
00:18:54,558 --> 00:18:57,740
for that child's growing body is taken in...

305
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:03,940
Eventually, that body will be incinerated by all that energy with nowhere to go.

306
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:04,862
Huh?

307
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:06,490
Wait a minute.

308
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:09,240
So those five kids you mentioned...

309
00:19:09,770 --> 00:19:13,220
You surmised correctly. They were summoned.

310
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:15,000
Are they okay, then?

311
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:20,510
They resulted when different nations tried and failed to summon a Hero.

312
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:24,760
Shizu-sensei took them in and did her best to save them.

313
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:28,890
Different nations? Whole nations are involved in summoning?

314
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:32,770
Yes. I suppose that was this world's choice.

315
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,780
Rather than strengthening armies so they can face monsters,

316
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:41,580
it may be more effective to summon an Otherworlder of incomparable strength.

317
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:43,030
That's what they thought.

318
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:48,280
If you know Shizu-sensei's strength, I'm sure you understand what that implies.

319
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,380
But...

320
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:54,110
Shizu-san hated this world.

321
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:57,380
So what's going to happen to these kids?

322
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:01,990
The longest any Summon has lasted according to our current records...

323
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:03,956
is five years.

324
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:05,422
Five years?

325
00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:08,600
No one has found a way to prevent their destruction.

326
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:13,160
Nearly all children under the age of ten who have been summoned

327
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:15,400
have died within five years.

328
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:21,650
The nations willingly let us have these children because of that, but still...

329
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:29,740
So no matter what I do with these kids, the nations won't complain, right?

330
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:31,620
You have something in mind?

331
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:32,921
Yeah.

332
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:36,890
If that's Shizu-san's wish, I'll take it on.

333
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,430
Please!

334
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:42,970
If it's at all possible, please save those children!

335
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:46,780
I'll just do whatever I can.

336
00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:50,470
It's what I've always done, and what I'll continue to do.

337
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:56,820
Right!

338
00:20:57,750 --> 00:21:01,030
Heya! Starting today, I'm your new te—

339
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:10,330
Wait... I thought these kids didn't have long left?

340
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:14,460
Aren't they just giving all that excess energy free rein to run wild?

341
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:15,930
Ken-chan, you're awesome!

342
00:21:15,930 --> 00:21:18,840
Is that your finishing move? You finally perfected it!

343
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:21,800
It wasn't good enough, though. He dodged it.

344
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,720
Shut up! I won't miss next time!

345
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:26,380
No way! No way! This is no good at all!

346
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:28,340
This classroom is pure chaos!

347
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:32,160
He looks... a little like Shizu-sensei.

348
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,850
Huh? You think so?

349
00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:35,880
He doesn't look a bit like her.

350
00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:38,230
Kenya Misaki, age 10.

351
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:40,480
Ryota Sekiguchi, age 10.

352
00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:42,670
Gale Gibson, age 11.

353
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:44,800
Alice Rondo, age 9.

354
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:47,160
Chloe Aubert, age 10.

355
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,600
I just felt something react...

356
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:55,700
Was that Veldora?

357
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,130
Anyway, since they're not supposed to have much time left,

358
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:02,590
I expected these kids to be meek and mild...

359
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,350
That's a bit depressing.

360
00:22:05,513 --> 00:22:12,394
I have to believe in me that you believe in

361
00:22:12,394 --> 00:22:20,858
A story just started, carrying a name

362
00:22:22,326 --> 00:22:29,050
Whether it's a concidence or a fate, who cares?

363
00:22:29,050 --> 00:22:34,787
Just pick one thing in here

364
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:42,242
Just from one chance, the future would change

365
00:22:42,242 --> 00:22:48,737
Along with the sky, the wind, and the land

366
00:22:48,737 --> 00:22:55,762
It's all because you keep believing in that possiblity

367
00:22:55,762 --> 00:23:02,315
That I can also keep believing. With my power...

368
00:23:02,315 --> 00:23:05,643
In the depths of the world that we must protect,

369
00:23:05,643 --> 00:23:08,997
rise up as many times as it take

370
00:23:08,997 --> 00:23:15,064
If I can't hold it with both hands, I'll lend it to you

371
00:23:15,674 --> 00:23:22,368
Even if you got shaken, face foward for the smile you wish to protect

372
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:27,294
There's a scenary I want to show you,

373
00:23:27,294 --> 00:23:29,815
let's go togehter

374
00:23:35,690 --> 00:23:39,000
Next time, "Shizu-san's Students."
