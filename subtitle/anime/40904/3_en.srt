1
00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:07,790
The screening is soon.

2
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:10,730
I wonder how our video will look like...

3
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:12,120
I'm feeling anxious.

4
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:17,210
I'm sorry. You guys couldn't watch it
because there's no time left after the edit.

5
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:21,090
It's fine. We're here already.
We can only trust you.

6
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:25,570
Exactly. We wouldn't even be able to hand it in
if it weren't for your idea.

7
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:28,290
It's going to be all right!

8
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:30,650
Attention, please!

9
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:35,000
The screening of General Practical Assignment 1
will begin soon.

10
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:40,440
As you all know, this screening session
is part of the curriculum.

11
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:41,970
However,

12
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:47,710
once you've produced something, you should
always be prepared for any feedback.

13
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:53,750
Everyone here is not only a creator
but also a keen-eyed audience.

14
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:57,220
Laugh or clap if you like the video

15
00:00:57,620 --> 00:00:59,930
but feel free to boo too.

16
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:03,470
"But it's made by my friend."
"But they worked really hard on it."

17
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:06,300
We don't need sentimental critics here.

18
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:10,730
You're all film students. I can't wait
to see your authentic reaction.

19
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:13,770
In other words, if the video is boring,
there'll be no reaction.

20
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:16,520
It will end in silence.

21
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:17,820
Hashiba.

22
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:22,030
I won't lose to you.

23
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:30,240
The screening will start now.

24
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:40,940
♫What happened before here, I'll be there♫

25
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:46,770
♫What happened before that day, we'll be there♫

26
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:51,030
♫As the sun sets♫

27
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:56,490
♫We chase after the fading shadow♫

28
00:01:57,229 --> 00:02:02,610
♫Everyone knows♫

29
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:06,770
♫You can't travel back in time♫

30
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:11,740
♫Laying in front of you♫

31
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:16,030
♫Is the future. No doubt♫

32
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:25,420
♫Who you really want to see is on the other end♫

33
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:31,770
♫That day, you took the first step
to chase after that person♫

34
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:38,800
♫What's in front of us is a story
that can't be turned into a song♫

35
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:42,110
♫I can't say what's going on♫

36
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:49,290
♫Now is not the season for answers yet♫

37
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:54,100
♫No need to use your voice to convey
what happened before♫

38
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:59,670
♫March with your dream♫

39
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:02,980
WHO AM I?

40
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,460
Tear-jerking. Well done!

41
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,920
As expected of Kawasegawa.

42
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:13,580
They outsmarted everyone.
Who knew they'd make a silent film.

43
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:18,880
No sound, no dialogue, but they managed
to convey the emotions of the protagonist.

44
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,280
The mise-en-scène is also beautiful.

45
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:24,400
In terms of polishedness and quality,

46
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,740
they are far beyond what we've achieved.

47
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:29,540
Team Kitayama is next.

48
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:31,110
Already?

49
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:32,770
Our setting is a train station too.

50
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:35,020
People will draw comparisons.

51
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,710
We did everything we could.

52
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:37,960
So...

53
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,850
God helps us.

54
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:51,500
Produced by Team Kitayama.

55
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:03,490
Eh? Photos?

56
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,420
Static images. That counts too?

57
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:07,980
This is...

58
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:17,230
It's what I could come up with back then.

59
00:04:20,149 --> 00:04:22,270
I'll definitely find a way.

60
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:25,270
Are you okay, Kyouya?

61
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:26,840
How?

62
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:29,460
I know I'm at fault here
and I don't have the right to say this.

63
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,680
But we only have these cameras.
We can't do anything.

64
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:35,360
We're supposed to make a video,
not to take photos.

65
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,600
We can work around it.

66
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,480
Stop it. Just give up.

67
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:41,000
Let's pack everything up and figure out
what we should do next.

68
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:41,970
I have a way.

69
00:04:43,409 --> 00:04:45,940
Please believe me.

70
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:50,040
I won't let all of you down.

71
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:54,550
Besides, I've been in
this kind of situation anyway.

72
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:59,200
I once managed to make a film out of
substandard images.

73
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:01,120
What did I do back then...?

74
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:07,380
AE. PR. PS. Those software already exist.

75
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:10,190
I won't disappoint them.

76
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:15,480
Hi, it's Kiryu.

77
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,770
Oh, Hashi! You finally decided
to join us?

78
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,710
"ANYONE'S WELCOME. FINE ARTS CLUB RECRUITING"
Yes, I would like to join the club.

79
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:25,310
Please teach me how to make
a stop motion animation.

80
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:30,300
And? Does it fit our setting?

81
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,530
Yes, perfectly.

82
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:37,000
Based on what Kiryu said,
you need 100 photos for one shot.

83
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:38,420
100?

84
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:42,140
Yes, that's why we'll use the still camera.

85
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:44,120
What should I do then?

86
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:47,150
Don't worry, Nanako. Two or three seconds
after you hear the shutter,

87
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:49,650
just start acting as if we're filming you.

88
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:51,290
Are you sure?

89
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:56,890
Yes, I'll pick the photos with
the best expression from the burst mode.

90
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,330
All right then.

91
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,690
For the dialogues, do we use dubbing
during the post-production?

92
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:05,620
Yes, but we need to adjust them
based on the frame rate...

93
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:06,700
I will do that.

94
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:09,300
Don't worry.

95
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:11,750
I won't throw another tantrum this time.

96
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:13,140
Thank you.

97
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:15,470
-Shino Aki.
-Yes!

98
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:20,830
Can you come up with a composition
that can bind still images together?

99
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:25,010
I know it's tough, but only you can do it.

100
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:26,310
Can I count on you?

101
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,550
Okay. I'll try.

102
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:31,060
I won't let you down.

103
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:34,030
By the way, did any of you
bring a digital camera?

104
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:35,990
I did.

105
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:38,520
But the quality is bad.

106
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:39,560
It's fine.

107
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,450
Good. This will do.

108
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,220
Good job, Nanako.

109
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,450
A 15-second short video

110
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:52,440
made by Nanako's digital camera.

111
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:56,380
For your return I patiently pray,

112
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:58,480
till my black hair turn gray one day.

113
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:04,180
We'll organize the still images
and tell a story.

114
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:07,930
We only have three minutes. Everything
has to be done within these three minutes.

115
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:32,430
Kami-Kosawa Station.

116
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,870
My hair is salt and pepper

117
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:43,200
and until now,

118
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,690
our love story couldn't be better.

119
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:56,200
The End.

120
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:04,970
Have we failed?

121
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:15,520
Well done, Team Kitayama!

122
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:16,980
For real?

123
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:19,080
More people applauded than just now.

124
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:20,760
Hooray!

125
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:23,350
Not bad.

126
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,990
MULTIMEDIA AMPHITHEATER

127
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,289
Kawasegawa and her team got first place.

128
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:38,929
Well, that's to be expected.

129
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:44,540
We got third place. I suppose it's not bad
considering the fierce competition...?

130
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:49,430
If only we had everything ready
during the shoot...

131
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,360
More people might like it.

132
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:57,920
I know all of you are not too happy
with the editing...

133
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,260
I could've done so much better!

134
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:02,120
What the hell, dude?

135
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:05,310
I had no idea what you were doing
during the shooting

136
00:09:05,530 --> 00:09:08,140
but upon seeing the final product, your
story-telling is mature. A lot of Easter eggs.

137
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:11,700
You're really talented. I'm impressed.

138
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:14,070
However, the script I wrote...

139
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:19,250
Not the original version, the revised version
that contains your input.

140
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:22,970
If we could convey it using motion pictures,
the effect would be amazing.

141
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:26,950
It might even be better than what we made here.

142
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:30,190
I could do better too!

143
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,670
You're good, Kyouya.

144
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:35,120
You managed to figure out a solution
to that kind of crisis.

145
00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:37,780
I was just following your order.

146
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:42,400
I...I was very touched!

147
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:47,000
However, if only I could act properly.

148
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:49,900
And then, we would...

149
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:52,730
Forget it!

150
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:56,370
You know what? I will be a better actress.

151
00:09:56,650 --> 00:09:58,870
I want to be an actress!

152
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,570
Kyouya,

153
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:04,720
you're a sly fox.

154
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,190
You look like an easygoing big brother

155
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:12,880
but in pivotal moments,
the light in your eyes shines so brightly.

156
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:16,570
Whether it's during the shooting
or the screening,

157
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:19,300
you get me pumped up.

158
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:25,020
Oi! I'm locking the door.
Group discussion should be done outside.

159
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,630
Unless...

160
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:29,680
You guys have your next target in sight?

161
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:30,800
Yes!

162
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:31,840
This guy.

163
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:32,870
Kyouya.

164
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,050
Kyouya.

165
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:36,440
We won't lose to him!

166
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:43,660
Good then. After the break, there will be
new assignments waiting for you.

167
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:46,040
Be prepared and show me the comeback.

168
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:47,180
Yes!

169
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:49,370
I love the passion.

170
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:54,450
Let's have a post-screening discussion.
No one mentions the camera accident.

171
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:56,510
We will mention it first and foremost!

172
00:10:56,820 --> 00:11:00,390
I need to include the duration and other details
in my storyboard next time.

173
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:01,830
Don't forget the script!

174
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,940
I will perform so well that
Kyouya drops his jaw on the ground.

175
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:07,930
I can't wait.

176
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:14,620
I'm finally one step closer to the Platinum Era
that I admired.

177
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:18,780
If I can push them to be better,

178
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,880
then my second life is worth it.

179
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:31,310
I don't understand why Hashiba wasn't the first.

180
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:33,070
It's simple.

181
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:36,980
As an assignment,
they were too creative about it.

182
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:40,120
I guess it was most likely an accident.

183
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:43,810
Perhaps they got the wrong camera.

184
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:45,240
Really?

185
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:49,490
It was unplanned and that's why their work
is the way it is now.

186
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:54,070
However, they make an interesting group.

187
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:57,800
They turned crisis into opportunity
and made that video.

188
00:11:58,090 --> 00:12:02,930
At the very least, Hashiba Kyouya
has outstanding problem-solving skills.

189
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:04,570
Indeed.

190
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:08,690
And so, for the end of term assignment,

191
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:11,700
you will shoot something
with Hashiba's team.

192
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:16,480
You're interested in Hashiba, are you not?

193
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:19,770
I...A little bit.

194
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:25,800
But only from a producer's perspective!

195
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:28,850
That's what I said, no?

196
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:31,980
I hate you, Sis!

197
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:35,140
My, my.

198
00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:41,490
She hasn't changed a bit, has she?

199
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,380
OSAKA ASIAN FILM FESTIVAL

200
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:45,110
BEST ORIGINAL VIDEO
KAWASEGAWA MISAKI

201
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:47,120
See you then!

202
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,760
All right. See you!

203
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,080
Thank you.

204
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,820
Sorry for asking you to cover for a shift
out of a sudden.

205
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:00,220
No worries. You worked hard.

206
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:02,220
By the way,

207
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:08,320
are you free?

208
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:11,010
KARAOKE

209
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:14,020
12 ZODIAC HOROSCOPE FOR TOMORROW

210
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:17,110
I haven't done karaoke for a long time.

211
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:19,410
Do you like karaoke?

212
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,800
I love it.

213
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:25,050
More precisely, I love the songs and singing.

214
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:27,140
I see.

215
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:32,920
And now...

216
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:41,570
"TOUCHING MY ANNOYING FRECKLES AND SIGH"
That's loud!

217
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:46,440
"THIS LOVE STORY WILL MELT LIKE A SUGAR"
It's as if the voice can reach my heart.

218
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:47,830
Goodness gracious.

219
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:53,090
"SOMETHING HURTS IN MY EVER-SLIMMING CHEST"
This is so bad.

220
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:04,050
I haven't sung for a long while.
It sure helped me de-stress.

221
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:07,600
Sorry, I know I can't sing.

222
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:10,000
It's okay.

223
00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:14,590
Back in my hometown, my grandma
is a folk singer.

224
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I sang with her since small

225
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:23,660
but I suck at it. I can never get a hang
of music theories.

226
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:32,170
And so, can I ask for a favor?

227
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:33,780
Yes?

228
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:39,780
I'm always alone when I sing
so I don't know where to improve.

229
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:46,790
When you're free, can you
come sing karaoke with me?

230
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,020
Please?

231
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:51,680
Sure, if you don't mind my company.

232
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:53,050
Really?

233
00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:54,530
Yay!

234
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,560
Thanks, Kyouya!

235
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:04,450
I feel very at ease too singing in front of you.

236
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:06,270
Hooray!

237
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:10,270
By the way, Nanako.

238
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:12,240
Yes?

239
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,920
I was thinking.

240
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,340
As you practice more and get more confident,

241
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:19,350
do you want to upload your song to the internet?

242
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:20,600
To the internet?

243
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:23,980
Yes, like we'll make a video of you singing

244
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:25,550
then share it to an online platform

245
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:27,390
and let everyone listen to it.

246
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:31,310
No. Hell no!

247
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:36,520
I can't sing at all.
Everyone will just insult me.

248
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:38,970
That why I said
after you have practiced enough...

249
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:41,020
No. Absolutely not!

250
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:42,960
Putting it online means showing it to everyone.

251
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:46,900
I'm not shameless enough to show everyone
how narcissistic I am!

252
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:49,930
Then...

253
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:52,860
What if it's a website that's only
accessible from Japan?

254
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:55,800
Only from Japan?

255
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:58,000
Does that site exist?

256
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:02,680
Yes, it will come online either
at the end of this year or early next year.

257
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:04,650
What do you think?

258
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:09,920
In that case...okay.

259
00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:11,050
Done deal!

260
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:13,280
Let's practice hard so that
we can upload videos one day!

261
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:16,110
Stop making decisions for me!

262
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,330
That can't be helped.

263
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:26,490
So, to the end of mid-term exams

264
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:31,080
and the increase in funding due to
new members in this Fine Arts Study Club.

265
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,600
Cheers!

266
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,740
Cheers!

267
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:44,210
All right, allow me to introduce myself again.

268
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:48,110
Fifth-grade student. Photography Department.
Kiryu Takashi.

269
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:50,830
Thank you for the stop-motion animation
last time.

270
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:55,060
No biggies! Thanks to all of you,
this club lives to see another year.

271
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:59,460
Not to mention we have some cute girls among us.

272
00:17:01,530 --> 00:17:03,940
I'm Hiyama Yurika. Third-grade student
in the Handicraft Department.

273
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,960
My main focus is pottery. Normally,
I make those things.

274
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:19,150
Wheels on the bus go round and round.
Round and round.

275
00:17:22,109 --> 00:17:26,839
I'm Sugimoto Mikio, second-grade
Music Department student. Nice to meet you.

276
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:29,650
Don't be fooled by his appearance.
He sings really well.

277
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,550
All eyes on me!

278
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:34,720
Let me celebrate this joy with a dance.

279
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:36,770
This is the welcoming posture.

280
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:38,940
This shows the excitement we have
towards the future.

281
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:45,250
-He's Kakihara Sho, a third-grade dancer.
-This is the expression of love.

282
00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:49,730
And this is the Dance of Bacchus!

283
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:51,410
Finally!

284
00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:53,850
The treasure of this club will
make its appearance soon.

285
00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:56,850
Mount Vesuvius Eruption!

286
00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:03,060
Such is the tragedy that befell Pompeii.

287
00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:08,450
I still have my shift.
Let's part ways here.

288
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,540
The dinner will be ready when you're back.

289
00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:12,380
Thanks!

290
00:18:14,890 --> 00:18:18,620
The seniors are fun to hang around.

291
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:23,220
Fun? More like they are the embodiment
of their respective talent.

292
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:25,020
Kyouya.

293
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:26,600
Yes?

294
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:33,320
You know I draw, don't you?

295
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,440
You have noticed...

296
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:41,700
It was supposed to be a secret

297
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:45,930
but I forgot to lock the door back then.

298
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:48,370
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have looked
without your consent.

299
00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:51,860
It's fine. It's my fault.

300
00:18:54,530 --> 00:18:56,110
Do you still remember what I said?

301
00:18:57,770 --> 00:18:59,880
"Someone who can't do anything

302
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:03,190
will try his hardest
to find something he can do."

303
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:04,450
Yes.

304
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:08,750
I'm not like everyone. I'm not good at anything.

305
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:11,950
I make mistakes in my day-to-day life.

306
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:15,340
I'm not good at sports
or studying.

307
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:21,130
The only thing I love...

308
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:23,450
Is drawing?

309
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:27,300
But I can't draw well.

310
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:31,200
It has always been just a hobby.

311
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:34,080
I won a prize before

312
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:37,230
but I can't make a living like that.

313
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:39,990
And so I thought, if I became a film student,

314
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:43,120
I could work for the media.

315
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:45,600
That's why I came to Oonaka.

316
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:49,330
Frankly speaking, I was too afraid
to apply to the Arts Department.

317
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:53,530
I like drawing, but I don't love it.

318
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,040
I am not confident.

319
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:57,770
That's why I kept it as a secret.

320
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:00,550
I thought I could be like you.

321
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:05,000
Like one day, I would suddenly have a spotlight.

322
00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:07,580
But that

323
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,440
will never ever happen to me.

324
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:11,150
Wait, it's because I...

325
00:20:11,290 --> 00:20:12,710
I was thinking.

326
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:18,550
If I stop drawing, will I find peace?
Will I...

327
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:19,570
No way!

328
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:24,720
You can't abandon drawing!

329
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,640
Kyouya...?

330
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:29,470
I...

331
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:38,660
I was touched by your...

332
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:42,960
I

333
00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:46,590
really like your drawing, Shino Aki.

334
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:54,240
I've already liked your drawing
from the distant future.

335
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:59,180
You said that during the shooting.

336
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:03,520
Only I could do it, so you counted on me.

337
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:05,890
Yes, I did.

338
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:10,350
I was really happy. Excited too.

339
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:14,300
I keep wondering what's in your mind

340
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:17,560
and it makes me want to know you better.

341
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:22,280
I've made up my mind.

342
00:21:22,610 --> 00:21:24,980
I will work hard to be like you.

343
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:32,090
I will practice more until I can draw
the world you want to see, Kyouya.

344
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:34,830
Do you have a goal, Kyouya?

345
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:38,710
I do,

346
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:41,610
but I can't tell you now.

347
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:44,040
What a shame.

348
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:48,830
But I'll work hard until you acknowledge me
as your friend.

349
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,800
My goal

350
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:56,400
is to make you say the same words
after ten years.

351
00:21:57,550 --> 00:21:59,320
My second life

352
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:01,490
has just begun.

353
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:13,690
