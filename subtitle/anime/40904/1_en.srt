1
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:21,600
I can't sleep.

2
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:26,710
SUCCEEDSOFT IS LIVE NOW

3
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:28,510
Eh? What?

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,630
SUCCEEDSOFT OFFICIAL LIVESTREAM

5
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,290
Sorry for the long wait!

6
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:38,860
We're finally ready to reveal a huge plan

7
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:40,520
to everyone!

8
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:42,550
A huge plan?

9
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:45,330
Oh yes! I remember now.

10
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:49,770
Yes, I get it.

11
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:04,260
What?

12
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:05,680
No way.

13
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:11,120
"KAWAGOE KYOUICHI, N@NA, AKISHIMA SHINO"
Kawagoe Kyouichi, N@NA, and Akishima Shino.

14
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,470
The entire Platinum Era is here!

15
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:16,670
How much did they pay them?

16
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:19,440
"SUCCEEDSOFT'S LATEST WORK"
It must be very hyped.

17
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:25,390
Oh well.

18
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:32,360
I have always loved things like
games, animes, or light novels.

19
00:01:33,979 --> 00:01:35,960
I did want to get into this industry

20
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:40,009
so I left my previous job
and applied to a galgame company.

21
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,310
But the management was so bad.

22
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:46,160
The sales weren't great,
so the company went bankrupt.

23
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,789
Hashiba Kyouya, 28 years old.

24
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:56,240
A run-of-the-mill bachelor who's about
to become an uncle.

25
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:01,650
Of course, no girlfriend or money.

26
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:04,850
And now, no job too.

27
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,620
Couldn't afford the rent eventually

28
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:19,850
so he used his last saving to purchase
an express bus ticket

29
00:02:21,079 --> 00:02:24,329
to go back to his hometown.

30
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:32,320
Direction, film and photo editing, computer
graphics, assistant screenwriter, logo designer.

31
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,150
I did everything I could, but nothing lasts.

32
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:40,250
What a shitty life.

33
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,890
I love Akishima Shino's art style.

34
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:21,300
INCOMING CALL: HASHIBA MIYOKO

35
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:23,550
Hi.

36
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:25,579
How are you, Kyouya?

37
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:28,100
Not good at all. What's up?

38
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:31,579
I was packing the luggage
and I found your belongings.

39
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:34,380
Just want to give you a call.
I'll bring them to you later.

40
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,490
My belongings? Like what?

41
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:39,810
Acceptance letter to Oonaka.
Isn't this super important to you?

42
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:42,579
See you in a bit!

43
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:53,440
Oonaka...

44
00:03:55,560 --> 00:04:00,310
Back then, I was trying to figure out which one
of the two school offers I should pick.

45
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:03,710
It's either an economics major
in an ordinary university

46
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:07,670
or a film student in Oonaka Arts College.

47
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:11,550
The application was for memorabilia's sake

48
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:13,930
because I really wanted to be a game developer,

49
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:15,810
but I got in.

50
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:17,850
However, I didn't show up.

51
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,620
First, it's because I think I'm not good enough
to be a game developer.

52
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:23,510
And secondly, I'll have an easier time
in a normal university.

53
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:31,770
I wonder what would happen
if I went to Oonaka instead.

54
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:35,360
Members of the Platinum Era and I
are at the same age too.

55
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,690
If I had gone to Oonaka,

56
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:42,300
perhaps I would be a game developer
like they are now.

57
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:45,810
If only I could go back in time after a nap.

58
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:48,040
But this time...

59
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:54,970
Kyouya!

60
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:57,090
Kyouya!

61
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,300
You... Have the decency to knock.

62
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:04,340
For you.

63
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:14,570
See you then.
I already did what I came here for.

64
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,920
Of course, you can't go back in time.

65
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:23,830
ACCEPTANCE LETTER

66
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:31,000
There's no second save in this world.

67
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:37,290
Back to job-hunting.

68
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:51,870
USELESS

69
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:03,830
MAY YOU HAVE A BRIGHT FUTURE AHEAD!

70
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:25,560
Don't do it!

71
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:34,570
I'm sorry!

72
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:40,930
Do I look suicidal?

73
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:47,250
Well... you look lonely.

74
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:51,200
Lonely...

75
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,320
Sorry!

76
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,800
I should be the one apologizing.

77
00:06:57,140 --> 00:07:01,030
I thought about something annoying again
so I'm a bit agitated.

78
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,760
Must be something infuriating.

79
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:04,980
Exactly!

80
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,830
Staff ran away during a crucial period.

81
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:09,870
Ran away?

82
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:13,060
We are game developers.

83
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:16,740
In our industry, it's a common occurrence.

84
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:21,990
I wonder where I can find someone

85
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,750
who can direct videos,

86
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:28,170
edit, maintain websites,

87
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:32,060
and know a lot of artists.

88
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,700
Uhm...

89
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:36,000
Yes?

90
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:38,130
I can do it.

91
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,320
You?

92
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:42,610
I think so.

93
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:55,490
SucceedSoft? That SucceedSoft?

94
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:56,890
I can't believe this.

95
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,790
Do your best! It's a precious opportunity.

96
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:09,880
SECOND DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT

97
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:12,460
Welcome, Mr. Hashiba Kyouya.

98
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:16,920
I'm the director of SucceedSoft's
Second Development Department, Kawasegawa.

99
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:18,150
Nice to meet you.

100
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,720
Nice to meet you.

101
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,620
She's a director already?

102
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:28,280
But she's around my age...
No, younger than me.

103
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:30,110
Impressive.

104
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:32,330
So,

105
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,510
let me show you what you're expected to perform.

106
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:36,730
Okay.

107
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:43,299
These are the documents of the ongoing projects.

108
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:46,410
Due to insufficient staff,
it's a bit of a mess now.

109
00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:51,670
Please excuse us for asking you to do
such menial job straight away. It must be tough.

110
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:53,080
We count on you.

111
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:58,080
I knew things wouldn't go as planned.

112
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:02,330
Whatever. I'm happy that I found a job already.

113
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:05,590
Eh?

114
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:10,510
This is...

115
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:15,040
It would be better like this.

116
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:18,240
Change the category here...

117
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:31,850
At first, every document was assigned a number.

118
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:37,810
I changed it so that you arrange them
in alphabetical order, then give them a number.

119
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:42,010
Those who don't need a hard copy
are all scanned into the PC.

120
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,870
Those who need a hard copy are all
kept in the folders on the shelves.

121
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:52,660
The toys and merchandise have been given
a tag too, so you can manage them on PC.

122
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:55,730
So...

123
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:57,310
What do you think?

124
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:01,880
Well, it's not what I expected.

125
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:03,530
Don't worry.

126
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:06,310
You did better than expected.

127
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:15,660
Let's delay the deadline by a week then.

128
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:19,690
Just send me what you've done so far,
even drafts will do.

129
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:23,540
We'll let the staff work on it first.

130
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:26,110
And also, for the next thing,

131
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:28,420
tonight, I'll...

132
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:32,150
My bad. I'll send it to you tomorrow.

133
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:33,750
See you!

134
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,560
Thank you, Hashiba.

135
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:41,830
I always get on this guy's nerves
when I talk to him.

136
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,260
It's so nice to have someone who can
deal with him tactfully.

137
00:10:44,530 --> 00:10:45,380
No biggies.

138
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,880
I'll leave the text to you.

139
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:53,670
Hashiba! About that video guide
on how to use the tool...

140
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:55,870
It's okay. I'll do it.

141
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:59,270
I'll finish it and share it before the check-up
tomorrow morning.

142
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:03,530
Hashiba, can you help me edit a video?

143
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:04,550
Sure.

144
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:06,910
It'll be done this evening.

145
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:09,190
Hashiba, I need help.

146
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:10,870
Sure, let me find a solution.

147
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,430
Sorry, Hashiba, I need help here too.

148
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:14,360
No problem.

149
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:16,790
What a lucky encounter

150
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:19,770
stemming from a small misunderstanding.

151
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:22,470
Thank god it's just a misunderstanding.

152
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:24,220
It still hurts a bit.

153
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:26,610
I'm sorry!

154
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:38,570
I was really upset back then.

155
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:42,910
I hated everything.
That's why I was there alone.

156
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,860
The company is in deep trouble now.

157
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:48,200
What do you mean?

158
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:53,420
The mobile game department
thinks that we're freeloaders.

159
00:11:54,290 --> 00:11:56,790
They are trying to hinder our progress.

160
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:01,630
Isn't it an anniversary event?
Why do they think that way?

161
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:05,630
Not everyone shares the same sentiment.

162
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:09,870
For those who don't care,
it's just a waste of money.

163
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:19,240
But I will make it work no matter what.

164
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:24,020
You don't get to see a workpiece from the
collective effort of Platinum Era every day.

165
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,810
It must be important to you.

166
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:31,970
Having you on the team is a great addition.

167
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:34,290
Thank you so much.

168
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:39,320
No need. It's something special to me too.

169
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,850
You like Akishima Shino?

170
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:44,470
Yes.

171
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:47,520
We should induce you officially.

172
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:49,130
Really?

173
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:51,560
That's the contract you signed.

174
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:55,140
Work for us for half a year,
and we'll consider.

175
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:57,170
I'll do my best!

176
00:12:57,730 --> 00:13:01,030
You'll get to see the Platinum Era
and talk to them too.

177
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:02,130
Yes!

178
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:11,890
SORRY, CAN YOU GIVE ME MORE TIME?

179
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:18,390
I heard the script is not ready yet.

180
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:21,540
It's been a month! This is not good.

181
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:24,510
I don't know what the director was thinking.

182
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,750
She's seldom here recently.

183
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:33,740
Everyone,

184
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:41,290
I have an announcement.

185
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:46,410
The board of advisors decided

186
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:54,140
to cease and shelve the Platinum Era project.

187
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:58,840
Why? What happened?

188
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,290
If only I had more power...

189
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:05,660
Sorry.

190
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:10,270
So why did we work so hard for?

191
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,530
-What will happen to this department?
-Mobile game is more important, I see.

192
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:13,390
Axed?

193
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:16,920
-First Department will mock us again.
-What a let-down.

194
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:18,100
Another...

195
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:21,440
Failure.

196
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:52,680
The team was disbanded,
the contract was terminated.

197
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,980
What did I do wrong?

198
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:14,030
If I had picked this school

199
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:20,040
and started creating, discussing,
brainstorming with friends...

200
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,420
Yes...

201
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:24,830
Meeting the Platinum Era members.

202
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,580
Creating together.
Compete and motivate each other.

203
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,980
And then...

204
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,670
And then what?

205
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,650
It's too late.

206
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,300
Kyouya!

207
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:47,330
Kyouya!

208
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:49,360
Kyouya!

209
00:15:53,210 --> 00:15:54,100
You're awake!

210
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:56,000
Were you exhausted from the excitement?

211
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:58,570
Are you mocking me?

212
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:02,680
Is cosplaying your hobby?

213
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,040
What are you on about?

214
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:10,850
Anyway, dad wants to know what you want
to eat as celebration.

215
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:12,550
Celebration?

216
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:15,630
You were all over the moon just now.

217
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,540
"I'm in Oonaka Arts College!"
Like that.

218
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,750
That's ten years ago.

219
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:24,300
Why are you still spouting nonsense
even though you're wide awake?

220
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:27,080
Nonsense? You...

221
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:34,750
Hey, did you remove the books here?

222
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:37,950
Of course not. Or else you'll be mad at me.

223
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:42,400
But there are only seven
The Familiar of Zero here...

224
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:46,790
Haganai, Asterisk, No Game No Life
are all gone.

225
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:48,250
Eh?

226
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:54,020
Didn't we throw away this CRT TV?

227
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:55,670
And,

228
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:59,020
there's only PS2 here. PS3 is gone.

229
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,970
Oh, let me check with my phone...

230
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:03,870
An old phone?

231
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:14,839
2006...?

232
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:26,609
You can't rewind or reload your life.

233
00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:29,260
Well, that's what I thought.

234
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:33,410
However, appearing in front of me

235
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:38,600
is the world ten years ago
that I'd die to travel back.

236
00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:51,830
♫What happened before here, I'll be there♫

237
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:57,660
♫What happened before that day, we'll be there♫

238
00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:01,920
♫As the sun sets♫

239
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:07,380
♫We chase after the fading shadow♫

240
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:13,500
♫Everyone knows♫

241
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:17,660
♫You can't travel back in time♫

242
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:22,630
♫Laying in front of you♫

243
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:26,920
♫Is the future. No doubt♫

244
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:36,310
♫Who you really want to see is on the other end♫

245
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:42,660
♫That day, you took the first step
to chase after that person♫

246
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:49,690
♫What's in front of us is a story
that can't be turned into a song♫

247
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:53,000
♫I can't say what's going on♫

248
00:18:53,110 --> 00:19:00,180
♫Now is not the season for answers yet♫

249
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:04,990
♫No need to use your voice to convey
what happened before♫

250
00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:10,560
♫March with your dream♫

251
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:28,380
I don't know what's happening yet

252
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:31,920
but I traveled back to the world ten years ago,

253
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,630
precisely at the moment where
I have to pick a university.

254
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:45,510
Instead of thinking about how I traveled
through time, I should now pick a school first.

255
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,200
KITAYAMA SHARE HOUSE

256
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:52,120
Here?

257
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:56,780
Ichisuka Higasi...

258
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:58,150
Turn right here.

259
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:07,720
I didn't believe in my own potential,
so I picked a normal route.

260
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:12,230
I regret it very much.

261
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:16,610
And now after I traveled back in time,
there's only one path left for me.

262
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:22,060
It's here.

263
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,010
Kitayama Share House.

264
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:32,340
Excuse me?

265
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:41,220
No one's here yet.

266
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,390
Akashika Moving Company here!

267
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:45,560
Coming!

268
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:47,040
Thank you.

269
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:55,330
All right. Time to unpack.

270
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:03,390
I'll deal with the rest tomorrow.

271
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:19,800
The only tip my dad gave me is that

272
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:23,100
you tend to have an imbalanced diet
when you're living alone.

273
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:26,840
So take in lactic acid bacteria
and bacillus natto regularly.

274
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:32,090
I should have bought another sports drink too.

275
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,470
I'm in Oonaka now.

276
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:45,830
Perhaps I can create with Akishima Shino,

277
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:48,260
Kawagoe Kyouichi, and N@NA.

278
00:21:49,410 --> 00:21:54,950
And this time, I have to...

279
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,800
Hashiba!

280
00:22:08,610 --> 00:22:09,510
Hashiba!

281
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:15,910
Hashiba! Wake up, you sleepyhead!

282
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:17,280
President?

283
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:19,790
This is the company I used to work for.

284
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:25,080
Wake up! You haven't submitted the CG
of Bubble Butt, Hashiba.

285
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:26,230
Is the President here?

286
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:32,740
Time to pay off your debt, President.

287
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:35,890
You got the wrong person!

288
00:22:36,170 --> 00:22:37,180
Cut!

289
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:42,520
Not like this, Hashiba. You're supposed
to flee from the debt collectors.

290
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:43,530
President?

291
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:48,620
Life and movie are different.
You can't start over, Hashiba.

292
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:54,160
All right. Take two.

293
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:56,200
There's no take three, Hashiba.

294
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:59,200
Okay. Run towards the light.

295
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:01,410
You decide your future, Hashiba.

296
00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:09,830
Scene 5, Take 12. Ready, action!

297
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,180
Is the President here?

298
00:23:12,810 --> 00:23:14,390
I cannot stop here.

299
00:23:19,050 --> 00:23:21,410
Things cannot end here.

300
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:34,650
What a nightmare.

301
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:47,150
This looks familiar...

302
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,360
SETTING: GIRL, ASLEEP BEFORE THE PROTAGONIST
OUTFIT: DISHEVELED, SHOWING PART OF HER BREAST

303
00:23:50,370 --> 00:23:53,350
Oh yes. I did this scene in an erogame.

304
00:23:55,090 --> 00:23:57,210
I'm still in the dream, aren't I?

305
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:09,340
It's morning already?

306
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:17,990
So cute!

307
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:25,330
What's the matter?

308
00:24:33,970 --> 00:24:35,630
I'm thirsty.

309
00:24:36,010 --> 00:24:36,950
I...

310
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:40,830
drank it...

311
00:24:47,530 --> 00:24:50,320
Morning yogurt is the best.

312
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:52,170
Huh? Yes.

313
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:56,330
Wait, you...

314
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:59,400
Oh, I haven't introduced myself.

315
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:04,350
What's that noise?

316
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:05,390
It's from upstairs.

317
00:25:08,890 --> 00:25:11,040
Are you all right? I'll barge in!

318
00:25:11,410 --> 00:25:12,650
Wait!

319
00:25:13,170 --> 00:25:15,000
What happened?

320
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:21,820
It's not like that!
I woke up and she's already next to me, and...

321
00:25:24,210 --> 00:25:28,000
My blanket is not here yet, so I borrowed his.

322
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:29,750
That's the reason?

323
00:25:38,950 --> 00:25:41,370
Let me introduce myself first.

324
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:45,390
I'm Kogure Nanako from Shiga Prefecture.

325
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:47,430
Just call me Nanako.

326
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:48,850
Nice to meet you.

327
00:25:49,710 --> 00:25:51,760
She looks like an outgoing hot girl.

328
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:55,290
Are you called Kogure because you picked up
bad habits...

329
00:25:56,120 --> 00:26:00,030
You managed to poke at where you shouldn't
the first time we met.

330
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:01,680
You're something.

331
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:05,290
That's why she wants others to call her Nanako.

332
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:10,720
I'm Rokuonji Tsurayuki.
No need for any nickname.

333
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,810
Your family name sounds so cool.

334
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:14,520
Boisterous brat.

335
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:17,550
My surname doesn't bother me at all.

336
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:20,120
And that means you can make fun of
someone's surname?

337
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:23,100
My turn then.

338
00:26:24,050 --> 00:26:26,220
I'm Hashiba Kyouya. Nice to meet you.

339
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:27,720
You can use my family...

340
00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:30,550
Kyouya, I have a question for you.

341
00:26:31,530 --> 00:26:32,710
Yes?

342
00:26:32,970 --> 00:26:37,170
What happened from yesterday till today?
Explain yourself.

343
00:26:37,410 --> 00:26:39,240
I just did!

344
00:26:39,450 --> 00:26:43,530
It's just, coincidentally, every bad event
came one after another.

345
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:48,060
So, you get to spend a night
with a girl you just met

346
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:50,540
and spray white, sticky fluid on her face?

347
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:55,060
Just a series of unfortu...

348
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,570
Do you think I'll believe you?

349
00:26:58,470 --> 00:27:00,680
I'll keep a close eye on you.

350
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,550
My turn now.

351
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:09,750
I'm Shino Aki,
from Itoshima Island of Fukuoka, Kyushu.

352
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:13,950
Shino Aki? Sounds like a guy's name.

353
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:15,990
I feel that too.

354
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:20,820
No. My family name is Shino.
Aki is my first name.

355
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:23,300
Together, it's Shino Aki.

356
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:28,210
You can use my family name too.

357
00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:29,520
Shino Aki is good.

358
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:31,110
I'm fine with Shino Aki too.

359
00:27:31,290 --> 00:27:32,400
Shino Aki it is!

360
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:36,140
Listen to me!

361
00:27:42,090 --> 00:27:43,090
And so,

362
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:47,180
the four of us
live in this share house together.

363
00:27:47,690 --> 00:27:49,810
Shino Aki and I will occupy the room upstairs.

364
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:52,240
Tsurayuki and Nanako
will live on the first floor.

365
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:56,080
This is the schedule for all household tasks.

366
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,060
KYOUYA: ALL TASKS, TSURAYUKI:
TAKING OUT THE TRASH OR OTHER LABORIOUS TASKS

367
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:59,170
"NANAKO: COOKING OCCASIONALLY, SHINO AKI: HEAD PAT"
Let's not dwell on why it became like this.

368
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:01,850
If it's brought up, something bad will happen.

369
00:28:07,130 --> 00:28:08,200
Anyway,

370
00:28:08,650 --> 00:28:12,080
I have two cute female roommates.

371
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:14,010
It's like a dream come true.

372
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:20,060
But that fiasco just now...

373
00:28:20,330 --> 00:28:22,850
I have to make sure that
I won't raise any suspicion anymore.

374
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:30,480
Also, all four of us are film students.

375
00:28:30,730 --> 00:28:32,670
What a coincidence!

376
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:36,560
Isn't it great? We can share notes.

377
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:40,210
However, is this place really Osaka?

378
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:42,520
It looks more underdeveloped
than my hometown.

379
00:28:43,170 --> 00:28:45,400
It's Osaka, all right.
We're just at the edge of it.

380
00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:50,610
I heard there used to be a warning sign here
that said "Beware of python!".

381
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:53,340
Can I go back?

382
00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:58,000
If a python is enough to scare you away,
then this will be more daunting.

383
00:28:59,090 --> 00:29:02,550
The infamous Oonaka Slope.

384
00:29:03,650 --> 00:29:05,980
That's right. There's also this.

385
00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:10,800
It's like the danger zone
before the final boss.

386
00:29:16,350 --> 00:29:21,100
HEISEI 18, OONAKA ARTS COLLEGE,
ORIENTATION DAY

387
00:29:23,610 --> 00:29:25,840
There are a lot of freshers.

388
00:29:26,170 --> 00:29:28,360
Indeed.

389
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:31,040
One hundred. Wait, even more.

390
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:32,360
I know right?

391
00:29:32,870 --> 00:29:38,920
All freshers, check the student ID on the table
and sit accordingly.

392
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:40,170
Got it?

393
00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:42,000
See you later then.

394
00:29:46,170 --> 00:29:48,180
33. Here then?

395
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:52,590
Yes.

396
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:55,010
I see. Excuse me.

397
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:58,990
I'm finally in Oonaka.

398
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:01,510
I'm Hikawa Genkiro.

399
00:30:01,930 --> 00:30:03,950
The "Genki" from "Get hyped!"

400
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,640
and the "ro" from Ichiro or Jiro.

401
00:30:06,850 --> 00:30:07,650
Nice to meet you.

402
00:30:08,630 --> 00:30:11,120
I'm Hashiba Kyouya. Nice to meet you.

403
00:30:11,430 --> 00:30:14,630
Oh, Hashiba. Do you practice any sport?

404
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:16,750
Not really.

405
00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:19,080
I've seen some baseball matches on TV.

406
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:23,090
Baseball? Lotti from Chiba played
so well last year.

407
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:27,380
Not to mentioned the Mi from Tomakomai
during last year's Summer Koshien too!

408
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:30,860
Oh, that's right.
That's what happened 10 years ago.

409
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:34,550
The Prince of Towel should have a
stellar performance this summer.

410
00:30:34,890 --> 00:30:36,900
Do you have a favorite athlete?

411
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:39,330
Eh?

412
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:41,430
Like Ohtani.

413
00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:42,780
Ohtani?

414
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:45,260
Is there someone called Ohtani?

415
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:47,380
That two-way player.

416
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:48,290
Two-way?

417
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:54,730
I mean...kill two birds with one stone!
I quite like this idiom.

418
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:58,280
That was close. I need to think before I speak.

419
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:00,210
Now, let's hear the speech

420
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:05,690
from Kano, the associate professor
in charge of internship.

421
00:31:06,570 --> 00:31:11,450
Hi everyone! I'm Kana, your associate professor.

422
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:13,420
Nice to meet you all!

423
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:15,350
Is she really a professor?

424
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:17,080
She's so young.

425
00:31:18,290 --> 00:31:23,250
First, I have a small survey for you.

426
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:28,320
So, raise your hand
if you want to be a film director.

427
00:31:29,690 --> 00:31:32,750
And any screenwriter?

428
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,780
Any animator?

429
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:37,980
Any game developer?

430
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:44,070
There are also other interests like photography,
recording, special effect, editing etc.

431
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:46,750
I see.

432
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:53,780
Listen carefully, everyone.

433
00:31:55,950 --> 00:32:00,580
First of all,
there were 135 film graduates last year.

434
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:01,570
Guess

435
00:32:01,730 --> 00:32:05,250
how many of them got the job they desired?

436
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:07,110
How many?

437
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:09,280
You. The blonde lady there. What do you think?

438
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:18,780
Uhm...

439
00:32:19,610 --> 00:32:22,140
Around 40?

440
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:24,350
Wrong.

441
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:28,080
If that's true, it'd be great.

442
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:30,880
The correct answer is

443
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:32,750
8.

444
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:36,240
Fewer than expected?

445
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:39,740
Compared to the previous years,
8 is a lot.

446
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,480
Let's change the subject
Let's talk about money.

447
00:32:44,850 --> 00:32:49,760
We will get hungry, sleepy,
want to go to the toilet.

448
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:52,830
We need clothes. We want a roof
on top of our head.

449
00:32:53,130 --> 00:32:58,460
Clothes, food, accommodation.
They are essential. They make money.

450
00:32:58,970 --> 00:32:59,680
But,

451
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:02,470
films, animes, video games.

452
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:07,710
They are the entertainment that comes after
you have a proper life.

453
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:11,210
In other words, they are not mandatory.
They are not that useful.

454
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:15,450
All of you came here
to make those kinds of things.

455
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:17,730
So, not only are you crazy,

456
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:19,460
you're also foolish.

457
00:33:21,130 --> 00:33:22,170
However,

458
00:33:22,330 --> 00:33:25,050
if the condition is right,
a fool can also be a product.

459
00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:26,330
This shall be your goal.

460
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:28,150
If you want to be a fool,

461
00:33:28,410 --> 00:33:30,520
be an unprecedented fool.

462
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:34,960
I sincerely hope that I can see that one day.

463
00:33:35,490 --> 00:33:36,430
That's all.

464
00:33:41,850 --> 00:33:44,920
She's right. It'll never be easy.

465
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:49,860
Now that I think about it,
this industry is very competitive.

466
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:54,820
Whether it's films, animes, or games,

467
00:33:55,190 --> 00:33:59,540
only a small number of people can be famous.

468
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:03,630
Even if this era is the Platinum Era,

469
00:34:04,050 --> 00:34:07,350
not everyone in the same age range
gets the spotlight.

470
00:34:07,790 --> 00:34:12,469
My previous life is the living proof.

471
00:34:12,949 --> 00:34:15,949
This is demotivating.
I can't do anything about it.

472
00:34:17,489 --> 00:34:19,469
Oh well, let's just march forward
and see how it goes.

473
00:34:22,570 --> 00:34:25,280
You dropped your student ID.

474
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:26,870
Mine?

475
00:34:31,690 --> 00:34:32,659
Director?

476
00:34:33,659 --> 00:34:37,320
What? I'm not in any club.

477
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:39,460
Excuse me.

478
00:34:42,350 --> 00:34:43,530
What's wrong?

479
00:34:44,370 --> 00:34:47,280
Can you give me my student ID back?

480
00:34:47,730 --> 00:34:48,610
Sorry.

481
00:34:49,030 --> 00:34:50,060
Thanks.

482
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:59,100
I see. Same department.

483
00:35:07,350 --> 00:35:12,140
Perhaps the Platinum Era trio are here too!

484
00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:16,660
TWO WEEKS LATER

485
00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:18,570
Scene 16, Act 1.

486
00:35:18,890 --> 00:35:20,770
Ready. Action!

487
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:25,230
Just like this, the lectures roll out as usual.

488
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:28,240
We can't make a movie straight away.

489
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:31,790
We visit the filming studio of our seniors.

490
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:35,270
We learn various filming techniques.

491
00:35:38,890 --> 00:35:41,550
Oi! The monster is not supposed
to defeat the hero!

492
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:42,950
Oops. Sorry. I got carried away.

493
00:35:43,650 --> 00:35:45,900
Don't be like him, freshers.

494
00:35:46,430 --> 00:35:53,560
Several months ago, we were still learning about
the "be" verb and quadratic function.

495
00:35:53,870 --> 00:35:56,450
And now, we are being introduced to
the 180-degree rule out of a sudden.

496
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:58,610
Of course we can't get it straight away.

497
00:35:59,390 --> 00:36:03,650
Besides, one month ago, I was 28 years old.

498
00:36:04,010 --> 00:36:05,360
That's not what I want.

499
00:36:06,470 --> 00:36:08,460
Well, there's one exception.

500
00:36:08,970 --> 00:36:13,360
The actor's position is wrong.
Stand further. We need space.

501
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:16,990
No need to pan. Just use a static frame.

502
00:36:17,430 --> 00:36:21,860
Kawasegawa has become the pivot of the scene.

503
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:24,650
She's so serious that

504
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:26,610
she scares people away at times.

505
00:36:26,970 --> 00:36:30,330
As expected from a director.
She does things differently.

506
00:36:30,990 --> 00:36:35,490
SCRIPTWRITING THEORIES: THE TEN PRINCIPLES

507
00:36:39,410 --> 00:36:40,900
Compared to her, I...

508
00:36:42,310 --> 00:36:45,920
Can I catch up to Platinum Era like this?

509
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:51,130
Tsurayuki, wake up!

510
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:56,100
Five more minutes.

511
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:58,920
My shift ended in the morning. I'm exhausted.

512
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,160
Everyone

513
00:37:03,030 --> 00:37:06,420
in Kitayama Share House is very chill.

514
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:09,200
To put it nicely, we're easy-going.

515
00:37:09,450 --> 00:37:13,090
To put it bluntly,
we're not the most eager students.

516
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:15,670
Truth be told, it's a relief.

517
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:19,660
If they are like Kawasegawa,

518
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:23,920
I'd be afraid of studying too.

519
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:28,040
Here.

520
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:32,830
The Ten Principles are the rules to help you
write a good script.

521
00:37:33,030 --> 00:37:36,400
There are ten principles

522
00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:40,040
but I only listed eight here. Weird, isn't it?

523
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:44,650
Any of you can tell me
what the last two principles are?

524
00:37:44,650 --> 00:37:47,000
For real? I have no idea.

525
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:48,030
I volunteer.

526
00:37:48,870 --> 00:37:51,350
Such enthusiasm. You are...

527
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:53,480
Kawasegawa Eiko.

528
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:57,710
One of them is Twist.

529
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:02,850
Twist refers to an unexpected turn of event.

530
00:38:03,110 --> 00:38:06,010
Like the failure of the main protagonist.

531
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:11,980
We're all imperfect. If there's no shortcoming
or failure, then the story lacks some spice.

532
00:38:12,510 --> 00:38:14,400
Using twist

533
00:38:14,730 --> 00:38:17,160
and watching how the protagonist
overcomes it is more dramatic.

534
00:38:17,330 --> 00:38:18,530
That's what I understood.

535
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:24,090
Correct. Good answer.

536
00:38:25,410 --> 00:38:26,740
Nice one.

537
00:38:26,910 --> 00:38:29,950
Do you want to reveal
the last principle too?

538
00:38:30,250 --> 00:38:32,170
I shouldn't hoard the glory.

539
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:33,540
So,

540
00:38:34,450 --> 00:38:37,160
why not we ask the one
who is snoring so loudly at the back?

541
00:38:40,710 --> 00:38:44,580
Interesting choice, Kawasegawa.

542
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:46,260
A mean one at that too.

543
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:47,790
You're welcome.

544
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:50,790
Since Kawasegawa extended such kindness,

545
00:38:51,150 --> 00:38:53,510
you, sleepyhead, answer me.

546
00:38:55,590 --> 00:38:57,440
Someone asked for me?

547
00:38:57,650 --> 00:39:00,810
The professor asked you a question.
The last principle.

548
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:03,510
The last one?

549
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:07,190
THE TEN PRINCIPLES

550
00:39:07,190 --> 00:39:09,270
TWIST

551
00:39:10,590 --> 00:39:13,010
So? Can't answer?

552
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:15,050
That's why you pay attention to your lecturer.

553
00:39:15,250 --> 00:39:16,340
Antagonist.

554
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:22,300
As its name implies,
it's the enemy of the protagonist.

555
00:39:22,670 --> 00:39:24,530
It can be a character or an organization.

556
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:27,430
If I have to use these nine principles
to explain,

557
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:31,500
you can view it as someone
who covets the Treasure.

558
00:39:32,430 --> 00:39:35,660
It's an important element that maintains
the suspense of the story

559
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:38,340
until the finale.

560
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,420
Did I get it right?

561
00:39:42,710 --> 00:39:45,020
What a surprising twist.

562
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:47,720
Yes, you're correct.

563
00:39:48,070 --> 00:39:49,680
Thank you.

564
00:39:55,540 --> 00:40:00,650
Let me take back what I said.
I cannot slack at all.

565
00:40:05,190 --> 00:40:06,860
It's no big deal.

566
00:40:07,710 --> 00:40:10,770
I read it from a book,
so I just regurgitated it.

567
00:40:11,050 --> 00:40:13,190
No need to praise me.

568
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:16,700
But that scary lecturer gave you a compliment.

569
00:40:17,030 --> 00:40:18,210
Just take it.

570
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:22,040
He just wanted to give us
some sort of encouragement.

571
00:40:22,550 --> 00:40:24,560
If you believe it, you won't be able to grow.

572
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:30,120
Let's go, Nanako. The third lecture is
about filming techniques.

573
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:31,990
All right.

574
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:33,870
See you!

575
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:38,420
Tsurayuki is so smart.

576
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:41,790
I have a hard time digesting the jargon

577
00:40:42,090 --> 00:40:43,880
so trying to keep apace with the lecture
is challenging enough.

578
00:40:44,070 --> 00:40:45,390
I know.

579
00:40:46,690 --> 00:40:47,740
That said,

580
00:40:49,330 --> 00:40:52,400
I thought I could gain an edge
over the freshers here

581
00:40:52,890 --> 00:40:57,160
due to having a decade's worth of experience.

582
00:40:58,070 --> 00:40:59,350
I know it's a small company,

583
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:01,820
but I've worked in the scene.

584
00:41:02,170 --> 00:41:04,660
The difference should show.

585
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:06,640
However, I quickly learn that

586
00:41:07,130 --> 00:41:10,940
I have a weak foundation.

587
00:41:11,450 --> 00:41:13,100
Some working experience

588
00:41:13,370 --> 00:41:15,550
doesn't hold a candle
to proper knowledge and talent.

589
00:41:16,710 --> 00:41:18,900
I feel it now.

590
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:30,140
Why are you sulking?

591
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:31,500
Nothing.

592
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:35,070
I'm fine.

593
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:37,200
That's good then.

594
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:40,340
By the way, Shino Aki.

595
00:41:41,250 --> 00:41:43,280
Why did you apply to Oonaka?

596
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:46,520
She pays attention
during the photography lecture.

597
00:41:47,650 --> 00:41:50,290
Perhaps she wants to be a cameraman?

598
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:54,960
Hikawa?

599
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:55,920
Yo!

600
00:41:56,210 --> 00:41:58,340
What's with this outfit?

601
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:01,290
What? This is my club's uniform.

602
00:42:01,470 --> 00:42:02,840
Uniform?

603
00:42:03,170 --> 00:42:08,400
Yes, one of the few Ninjutsu clubs in the world.

604
00:42:08,630 --> 00:42:10,390
I joined one.

605
00:42:10,590 --> 00:42:12,250
I have heard about it.

606
00:42:12,590 --> 00:42:15,600
Apparently, in all Japan, only
Oonaka Arts College has one.

607
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:17,920
Right? It's rare.

608
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:21,820
Also, there are a lot of female ninjas too.

609
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:24,350
So that's why?

610
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:27,500
Hikawa seems to be enjoying himself.

611
00:42:27,590 --> 00:42:28,600
I am!

612
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:31,220
You should check out other clubs too.

613
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:32,950
It'll be super fun!

614
00:42:38,810 --> 00:42:41,840
Club center...here?

615
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:44,440
Seems like it.

616
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:48,610
But there's no one here.

617
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:51,120
Hey!

618
00:42:52,550 --> 00:42:53,900
Over here!

619
00:42:55,810 --> 00:42:57,050
Are you freshers?

620
00:42:57,340 --> 00:42:58,830
Yes.

621
00:42:59,070 --> 00:43:00,120
Yes.

622
00:43:00,530 --> 00:43:01,670
I knew it.

623
00:43:02,050 --> 00:43:03,540
It's settled then.

624
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:10,570
2006 Welcome Party will start now!

625
00:43:10,970 --> 00:43:12,090
Cheers!

626
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:23,180
We haven't decided if we want in or not.
Will it be okay?

627
00:43:23,670 --> 00:43:25,020
It will be.

628
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:28,690
They didn't ask us which club either.

629
00:43:30,110 --> 00:43:31,020
True.

630
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:58,290
Shino Aki, what do you want to do
in the future?

631
00:44:29,930 --> 00:44:30,970
You're awake.

632
00:44:32,650 --> 00:44:33,830
Kyouya...

633
00:44:34,950 --> 00:44:35,830
Sorry!

634
00:44:36,210 --> 00:44:37,750
Don't worry.

635
00:44:38,190 --> 00:44:40,730
Ever since school started, you only
have your eyes on studying and other stuff.

636
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:42,410
You must have been too busy to rest.

637
00:44:52,810 --> 00:44:55,180
You're so reliable, Kyouya.

638
00:44:55,660 --> 00:44:57,720
You're not like your age at all.

639
00:44:59,330 --> 00:45:00,810
Really?

640
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:04,250
Yes. You check on others too.

641
00:45:04,550 --> 00:45:07,450
Dependable beyond your age.

642
00:45:08,530 --> 00:45:12,880
However, sometimes I think you
overcomplicate things. It tires you out.

643
00:45:13,650 --> 00:45:17,140
Like this noon, you were deep in your thoughts.

644
00:45:18,930 --> 00:45:21,890
Like I said, I'm fine.

645
00:45:22,430 --> 00:45:23,650
Ouch!

646
00:45:23,970 --> 00:45:25,810
No more riddle. Just tell me.

647
00:45:26,550 --> 00:45:28,880
Maybe you'll feel better afterward.

648
00:45:33,370 --> 00:45:36,350
What Tsurayuki did today

649
00:45:36,750 --> 00:45:40,360
makes me feel like I'm useless.

650
00:45:41,250 --> 00:45:43,380
No, it's not just him.

651
00:45:43,820 --> 00:45:47,320
Everyone in this college has a spotlight
following them

652
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:51,650
but I have nothing.

653
00:45:52,670 --> 00:45:55,720
That's why I feel so...useless.

654
00:45:56,850 --> 00:45:59,190
It bothers me.

655
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:05,490
But in my opinion, you know everything.
I'm surprised to hear this from you.

656
00:46:05,860 --> 00:46:07,160
Not everything.

657
00:46:09,260 --> 00:46:12,890
You can cook, can't you?

658
00:46:13,350 --> 00:46:14,030
Yes.

659
00:46:14,370 --> 00:46:17,860
You can clean and make everything look tidy,
can't you?

660
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:18,960
Yes.

661
00:46:19,270 --> 00:46:22,850
You can formulate a plan
and stick to it, can't you?

662
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:23,940
Yes.

663
00:46:24,220 --> 00:46:27,660
I can't do any of them

664
00:46:28,530 --> 00:46:32,190
so I envy those who can.

665
00:46:33,140 --> 00:46:36,560
The same goes to Tsurayuki too.

666
00:46:37,250 --> 00:46:41,390
He must be envious of you too.

667
00:46:42,990 --> 00:46:44,530
Someone who can't do anything

668
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:48,590
will try his hardest
to find something he can do.

669
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:51,300
So those who you think are very capable

670
00:46:51,530 --> 00:46:55,970
must have their own problems
that they want to solve too.

671
00:47:06,250 --> 00:47:08,070
There, there.

672
00:47:11,530 --> 00:47:13,820
Shino Aki. I...

673
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:17,560
Thank you.

674
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:21,850
I should work hard too.

675
00:47:23,570 --> 00:47:24,670
I...

676
00:47:26,590 --> 00:47:27,950
What can I do?

677
00:47:32,830 --> 00:47:33,770
We're home!

678
00:47:34,930 --> 00:47:36,730
They went to work, didn't they?

679
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:40,090
I'll go to the bed then.

680
00:47:40,470 --> 00:47:41,150
Okay.

681
00:47:42,770 --> 00:47:44,000
Coming up next.

682
00:47:44,470 --> 00:47:48,830
Weird noises were reported this morning,
around 6AM, coming from Dotonbori.

683
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:51,750
I'm knackered.
I'll deal with the homework tomorrow.

684
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:53,640
Time for a shower.

685
00:47:56,180 --> 00:47:58,540
Oh no! I forgot to return this to her.

686
00:48:02,790 --> 00:48:04,070
Is she asleep?

687
00:48:07,710 --> 00:48:09,570
Shino Aki, are you still awake?

688
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:34,150
Akishima Shino

689
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:36,710
is Shino Aki.

690
00:48:37,310 --> 00:48:38,670
Someone who can't do anything

691
00:48:39,070 --> 00:48:42,530
will try his hardest
to find something he can do.

692
00:48:42,990 --> 00:48:47,920
I see. This is what Shino Aki wants to do.

693
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:53,450
I want to find out

694
00:48:55,570 --> 00:48:58,690
what I want to do

695
00:49:00,110 --> 00:49:02,760

EP02 BACK TO 10 YEARS AGO
