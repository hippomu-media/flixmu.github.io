1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:03,480
Tsurayuki! Why did you do that?

2
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:04,920
I said I'm sorry!

3
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:07,270
I was hungry
and I couldn't find anything to eat.

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,270
That doesn't mean you could eat my food!

5
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:13,360
I'm really sorry.

6
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,790
But see? I left you some instant noodle here...

7
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:20,800
This is shoyu flavor,
and mine was tonkatsu flavor.

8
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:22,750
They are completely different!

9
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,330
They are not that different.

10
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:26,460
I got into Oonaka this spring

11
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:30,730
and I rented a house
with three other classmates.

12
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:36,140
Two boys and two girls in a house.
I thought my dream roommates life will begin...

13
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:38,240
I heard that!

14
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:43,930
Tsurayuki, you're at fault here. You shouldn't
eat someone's food without permission.

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,140
It's a no-no if we were to live together.

16
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:49,810
What's the matter? Say something.

17
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:54,170
Well, Nanako, your outfit...

18
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:56,200
My outfit?

19
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,410
Avert your gaze!

20
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:07,480
I forgot that I was getting changed.

21
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:09,840
That was a strong punch, wasn't it?

22
00:01:10,789 --> 00:01:16,640
For some unknown reason, I traveled back
to the world a decade ago.

23
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:19,370
"DO NOT EAT SOMEONE'S FOOD"
It's the so-called time leap.

24
00:01:19,789 --> 00:01:21,840
In this second chance at varsity life

25
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:24,660
peppered with instant noodles, chest pain,

26
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:27,050
hope, and insecurity,

27
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:30,930
my creative journey is about to begin.

28
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:34,880
What will the future hold for us?

29
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,940
♫What happened before here, I'll be there♫

30
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:50,770
♫What happened before that day, we'll be there♫

31
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:55,030
♫As the sun sets♫

32
00:01:55,210 --> 00:02:00,490
♫We chase after the fading shadow♫

33
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:06,610
♫Everyone knows♫

34
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:10,770
♫You can't travel back in time♫

35
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:15,740
♫Laying in front of you♫

36
00:02:16,079 --> 00:02:20,030
♫Is the future. No doubt♫

37
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:29,420
♫Who you really want to see is on the other end♫

38
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:35,770
♫That day, you took the first step
to chase after that person♫

39
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:42,800
♫What's in front of us is a story
that can't be turned into a song♫

40
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:46,110
♫I can't say what's going on♫

41
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:53,290
♫Now is not the season for answers yet♫

42
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:58,100
♫No need to use your voice to convey
what happened before♫

43
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:03,670
♫March with your dream♫

44
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:08,960
BACK TO 10 YEARS AGO

45
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:15,920
These four elements are crucial
in video-making.

46
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:19,329
I want all of you to focus on one element

47
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:21,480
and form a team of four.

48
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:27,790
Together, make a video no longer than
three minutes. It's mandatory.

49
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:31,170
There will be a screening session afterward
to display your work.

50
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,750
So everyone will see our work?

51
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:35,910
Guess we have to do it properly this time.

52
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:40,960
And lastly, the theme is...

53
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,530
The theme is "Time".

54
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:48,710
It's too vague. I don't know how to begin.

55
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:49,680
Likewise.

56
00:03:50,329 --> 00:03:56,130
And the video cannot exceed three minutes.
Our lecturer is so strict.

57
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:58,910
Fortunately, we already have a team.

58
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:02,060
Since we all live in the Kitayama Share House,
it'll be Team Kitayama.

59
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:03,920
We sure didn't give it much thought.

60
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:07,390
You'll be the director,
Shino Aki will be the technician.

61
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:10,300
Nanako will be the actress,
and I'll be the producer.

62
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,630
I would love to write the script

63
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:17,190
but I'm not interested in acting.
That's why I leave it to you.

64
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:22,920
I can't believe we work at the same place.

65
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:26,140
I know right? We also noted down
the same address on our resume.

66
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:28,090
No wonder the shop owner
gave us a weird look.

67
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:29,220
A weird look?

68
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:34,610
Forget it. Those are for this rack.
Give them to me.

69
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:35,940
Sure.

70
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:42,750
Nanako,

71
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:48,740
why did you come to Oonaka?
Is it for your dream?

72
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:57,010
No specific reason, actually.

73
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,250
If I have to choose a reason...
Let's say that I got sick of the Lake Biwa.

74
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:02,050
The Lake Biwa?

75
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,060
Yes. Truth be told,

76
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:08,070
before I went to elementary school,
I thought the lake was the ocean.

77
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:12,520
I kid you not! Lake Biwa is huge!

78
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,400
You'd think it's an ocean once you're there too.

79
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:20,400
Well...

80
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:25,050
It's a place that has nothing of interest.
There's a town and some shops.

81
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,540
You can get whatever you need to live.

82
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:31,660
If I don't leave that place, I'd spend the rest
of my life not knowing how an ocean looks like.

83
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:48,560
Days passed by just like that
and I started to be afraid.

84
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:52,590
When I snapped back to the reality,
I'm already here.

85
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:57,940
I know it's embarrassing, but just think of this
as my journey to find my true self.

86
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:01,120
I can understand.

87
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,950
Attention. The door is closing.

88
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,570
Are you here to find your true self too?

89
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:41,720
Yes.

90
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:46,590
What?

91
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:49,990
Give me this. This is for the upper rack.

92
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,640
Wait, Nanako!

93
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:54,450
Eh? The inside is stuck.

94
00:06:55,409 --> 00:06:57,590
Sorry. I'll fix it quickly.

95
00:06:58,130 --> 00:06:59,220
Quickly?

96
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:01,510
Pretend I said nothing.

97
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:04,150
Just give me a moment...

98
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:12,210
I can pretend to be young
but deep down, I'm already 28.

99
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:16,070
Nanako, I...

100
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,300
Thank you.

101
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:18,550
No worries.

102
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:20,430
Let's hurry up and finish the work.

103
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:25,940
It goes without saying that the longer
we spend here together, the better.

104
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:27,450
Stop dilly-dallying!

105
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:40,710
You want to submit the plot later?

106
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:43,630
Yes. We're still brainstorming.

107
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:47,850
The fine details in life
can be your inspirations.

108
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:50,220
So keep a lookout.

109
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:51,570
Noted.

110
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:55,380
Has anything interesting happened lately?

111
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:57,460
Recently?

112
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:04,870
It looks that interesting?

113
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:06,610
Of course...

114
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:09,630
Nothing!

115
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,540
I'll take my leave.

116
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:19,410
I have to make up my mind.

117
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:22,660
I'm back.

118
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,140
Shino Aki, you might catch a cold.

119
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:34,330
I'm already full.

120
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:36,679
Yes, you ate a lot and you're full.

121
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:48,850
Morning, Kyouya.

122
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:58,870
I had a very wonderful dream.

123
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:02,190
I ate tons of oysters from Itoshima Island.

124
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,470
Sorry for waking you up then.

125
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:08,940
By the way, Shino Aki,
why did you come to Oonaka?

126
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:14,290
Growing up, I'm not good at anything.

127
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:17,450
I wanted to find something I'm good at

128
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,210
so I came here.

129
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:21,050
Is that the reason?

130
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:26,600
Yes. I'm not smart academically.

131
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:29,170
I often miss my train station too.

132
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:31,500
I can totally picture that.

133
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:36,370
I live in a rural area. If I miss my station,
I have to wait another 30 minutes.

134
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:39,650
The staff has even become my friend.

135
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:00,090
What's the matter?

136
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:03,280
I think I know what we should shoot.

137
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:07,250
The setting will be a train station.

138
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:09,010
A train station? Why?

139
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:14,810
We often take the train so we're familiar
with the place and it's not too alienating.

140
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:19,140
If you want to tell a story within 3 minutes,
a train station is a good starting point.

141
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:21,210
It makes sense.

142
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:22,960
I'm always at the train station.

143
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:27,130
Also, we spend a long time in the train station.

144
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:29,230
We can easily use it to describe
the passing of time.

145
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:31,250
Why not use this setting

146
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:35,970
to depict the life of a girl
within three minutes?

147
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:41,530
We can even sync it to the different moments
of a day. Isn't it interesting?

148
00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:42,670
What do you think?

149
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:45,050
It's interesting. Not bad.

150
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:49,390
I agree. I want to see how it's like
in video.

151
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:50,920
What do you think, Tsurayuki?

152
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:54,450
Can you give me 30 minutes?

153
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:59,050
What happened to him?

154
00:10:59,120 --> 00:10:59,930
No idea.

155
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:09,950
This is...?

156
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,820
The plot I wrote based on what Kyouya said.

157
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:15,420
I think that's what you want?

158
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:17,810
Wow! This is exactly what I have in mind.

159
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:23,130
You're so talented, Tsurayuki.
You wrote this within a short time.

160
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,130
Not too shabby for someone like you.

161
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:28,050
Well, I can't come up with any idea

162
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:29,990
so I have to contribute more somewhere else.

163
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,980
That's settled then.

164
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,280
All good!

165
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:34,210
All right.

166
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:35,840
I can't wait to...

167
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:36,790
Kyouya,

168
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:38,860
can we talk?

169
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:49,420
What's wrong, Tsurayuki?

170
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:51,910
This is...?

171
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:55,330
An idea that I wrote down on my note.

172
00:11:58,010 --> 00:11:59,090
This is...

173
00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:05,410
It's the same idea
as what you suggested just now.

174
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:06,400
I didn't plagiarize it!

175
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:07,840
I know.

176
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:13,300
This note was in a locked box.
You can't even take a peek at it if you want to.

177
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:18,430
However, it's as if you could read my mind

178
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:20,670
and came up with this idea.

179
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,860
It feels like someone stole my idea.

180
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:27,610
That's why I had to rush the plot.

181
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:29,400
I...

182
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:32,400
Honestly, I was really surprised.

183
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:39,310
Anyway, where did I get this idea from?

184
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:43,300
Oh yes! I once read a novella

185
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:48,200
that used a train station to depict
the life of a girl.

186
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:54,250
I was inspired by it.

187
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:59,810
Undoubtedly, I read that book in the future.

188
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:05,680
Did I steal the idea from the future Tsurayuki?

189
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:10,780
Kyouya, is this a coincidence

190
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:15,630
or is there...a particular reason?

191
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:23,560
Say something, Kyouya.

192
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:33,640
Seems like I overthought this.

193
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:37,060
I'm sorry. This can only be a coincidence.

194
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:40,490
It's not impossible that
we came up with the same idea.

195
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:42,710
Yes.

196
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:45,240
I'm actually relieved.

197
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:46,280
What do you mean?

198
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:51,440
A train station is a good starting point
to delve into

199
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,090
a character's behavior or for plot development.

200
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:58,610
Anyone who has written a script knows this.

201
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:04,140
However, among all the freshers in Oonaka,
no one is sharp enough to notice this.

202
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:07,030
I thought I could just wing the video

203
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:10,250
and learn things my own way.

204
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:15,420
With you, Kyouya, I feel like
I can create something better.

205
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:19,860
Let's surprise the lecturers
with our work.

206
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:22,710
Definitely.

207
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:04,260
Trim it down?

208
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:07,980
If this continues,
it will surpass three minutes.

209
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:09,800
We can only rewrite the script.

210
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:14,970
I racked my brain to produce
the best version of it.

211
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:19,650
You can't ask me to trim it down
just because it exceeds the time limit.

212
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,010
But...

213
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:26,190
Shino Aki, can you adjust the storyboard?

214
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:31,770
Well, it's not impossible.

215
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:35,690
We can also speak faster to save more time.

216
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:40,210
I have to try first.

217
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:41,870
See? That's enough.

218
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:44,090
Don't beat it until you try it,

219
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,160
right?

220
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:50,300
For this assignment, we have to
respect the time limit.

221
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:55,190
Even if the video is good, if it's more than
three minutes, we'll be disqualified.

222
00:15:55,690 --> 00:15:59,800
However, can Tsurayuki accept this reasoning?

223
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:03,430
This is what I can do.

224
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:07,820
It's an assignment. If we disregard the rule,
we won't be assessed.

225
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:08,940
So...

226
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,120
I see. I got it.

227
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,420
I'll cut it down.

228
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:17,040
Tsurayuki.

229
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:20,480
Is this your answer to the masterpiece
that we promised to create together,

230
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:21,630
Kyouya?

231
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:28,580
Boring.

232
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:38,650
Honestly, Tsurayuki is a perfectionist.

233
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:41,700
Just trim it if it goes over three minutes.

234
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:44,410
Don't mind him.

235
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:48,830
Oh, fair lady who graces my face with your foot!

236
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:54,700
As hard as I may in holding myself back
from admiring your beauty,

237
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:56,770
can I ask for a favor?

238
00:16:57,050 --> 00:16:58,710
That is if you still have an ounce
of pity left

239
00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:02,860
for me who are cut off from my parents
and are paralyzed due to starvation.

240
00:17:04,530 --> 00:17:06,099
Here?

241
00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:08,450
Yes. Thank you.

242
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:11,920
Thanks to you all,

243
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:15,619
I can finally make it back
to the club office.

244
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Freshers,

245
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:21,200
captured!

246
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:22,890
Well done, president!

247
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:26,490
The tragedy of not having funds for
three consecutive years will end now.

248
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:29,490
We can finally survive this year.

249
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:32,000
I'm truly sorry.

250
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:34,520
We set this weird trap. Please excuse us.

251
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:37,000
It's okay. Sit back up.

252
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:38,600
Are you willing to join us then?

253
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,360
This is another story.

254
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:42,700
So no?

255
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:46,110
I beg of you! We really need new members.

256
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:49,610
Lend us your name at least, Hashi.

257
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:51,630
Don't simply give me a nickname!

258
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:55,630
Also, club activities and whatnot, I...

259
00:17:56,050 --> 00:17:57,820
Can I join then?

260
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:01,320
I don't mind joining temporarily too.

261
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,270
Really?

262
00:18:02,530 --> 00:18:05,930
Hooray!

263
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:07,800
I...

264
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:12,810
I'm Kiryu Takashi, a fifth-grade student
in the Photography Department.

265
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:15,810
Feel free to ask me anything about
photography.

266
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:18,060
I'll be waiting for you.

267
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:38,750
Hashiba Kyouya.

268
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,810
Ah, direct...

269
00:18:41,170 --> 00:18:43,070
Wait, Kawasegawa.

270
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:47,310
Is your team using the train station
as your setting?

271
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:50,950
Yes, yours too?

272
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,130
I won't lose.

273
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:55,750
I don't know what kind of things
you'll shoot,

274
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,710
but we'll take the first place.

275
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:00,270
Okay...

276
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:04,900
Don't ever think that I'm on your level.

277
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:06,780
Hey, we want to shoot something great too...

278
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:08,000
Let me ask you then.

279
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,490
What's the concept of the video?

280
00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:12,200
What do you focus on?

281
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:15,010
How do you plan to use these three minutes
to the fullest?

282
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:17,750
You're the producer.
You have the answers, don't you?

283
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:18,850
I...

284
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:23,590
Take filming seriously.

285
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:28,030
This is the filming permission.

286
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,540
I'll verify it. Give me a moment.

287
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:32,760
Where is it...?

288
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:37,780
Sorry for the long wait.

289
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:41,570
It's tough on the producer, isn't it?

290
00:19:42,650 --> 00:19:45,110
I heard you guys quarreled.

291
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:47,000
No, we...

292
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:48,380
Well, yes.

293
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:52,400
This is...?

294
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:55,300
The script for the movie released
several days ago.

295
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:58,700
It was widely acclaimed.
Some even said it's award-worthy.

296
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:02,370
However, the movie is poorly received.

297
00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:06,590
Mainly because the director and the actors
got carried away.

298
00:20:06,890 --> 00:20:08,720
The movie was too long.
The pacing was a mess.

299
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:10,550
It couldn't bring out the charm of the script.

300
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:12,270
That's challenging.

301
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,740
The script doesn't represent the entire work.

302
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:18,940
If you wish to convey your message via words,
then being a novelist will do the trick.

303
00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:22,140
The script is not the sole factor
that decides whether the movie is good or bad.

304
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:27,620
A producer is not a leftover position.

305
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:31,580
If a producer decides it's over,
then it's over.

306
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:33,930
It's a very important role.

307
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:36,580
You're the producer.
You have the answers, don't you?

308
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:39,640
Take filming seriously.

309
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:42,660
Just a piece of advice from me.

310
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:46,830
Everyone who participates
in the creative process is a creator.

311
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:48,910
There's no hierarchy.

312
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:53,550
Thank you.

313
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:58,680
♫Create, follow what your heart wants♫

314
00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:02,090
10 years ago or 10 years later,
our time is limited.

315
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:06,560
Why didn't I notice such an obvious thing?

316
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:10,900
We commit so that we won't have any regrets.
Or else, nothing will change.

317
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:14,810
Tsurayuki!

318
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:16,990
What's up?

319
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:18,170
I'm sorry!

320
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:20,120
Why so sudden?

321
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:21,360
What happened?

322
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:22,400
What's going on?

323
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:27,750
Can you spare me some time?
I want to talk to you.

324
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:32,250
It's already over. I don't care.

325
00:21:32,410 --> 00:21:35,340
No, it hasn't even begun.

326
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:37,400
Like what you said,

327
00:21:37,770 --> 00:21:42,130
the shooting and the editing haven't even
started. I don't want to give up now.

328
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:43,730
Kyouya...

329
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:47,430
Let's do our best and film it first.
We'll communicate

330
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:49,290
and decide what to do later.

331
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:50,600
As for the time limit,

332
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:52,290
we'll deal with it when we're there.

333
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:55,780
That can't be helped.

334
00:21:56,390 --> 00:21:57,680
Let's do it then.

335
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:01,630
♫Even if I'm hurt, it can't end here♫
Let's work together.

Nice weather today.

339
00:22:13,770 --> 00:22:17,440
I picked the date after consulting
the weather forecast. I thought it through.

340
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:21,650
I also tried my best
to keep it within three minutes.

341
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:23,020
Thank you.

342
00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:24,650
Let's work hard together.

343
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:25,500
Yes.

344
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:29,120
Eh? This is...?

345
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,070
What's up?

346
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,870
The equipment that Tsurayuki borrowed

347
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:35,550
is not a video camera.

348
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:38,190
Impossible.

349
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:42,360
DIGITAL SINGLE-LENS REFLEX CAMERA

350
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:43,480
I wrote the wrong thing.

351
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:45,910
Let's borrow it again.

352
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:48,770
No, we'll waste too much time.

353
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:49,890
How...?

354
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:52,510
I'm sorry. I ruined everything.

355
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:55,710
It's okay. We can't do anything about it.
Let's...

356
00:22:56,770 --> 00:22:58,320
That's right. We have no other option.

357
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,440
No other...option?

358
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:09,290
I kept telling myself that and I regretted it.
That's how I spent my previous decade.

359
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:12,510
I finally got a second chance.

360
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:14,970
Am I going to make the same mistake again?

361
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:19,550
Should I find some excuse
and let my future self deal with it?

362
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:23,310
Do I want to spend another ten years like this?

363
00:23:26,290 --> 00:23:27,060
No.

364
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:28,910
There is a way.

365
00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:33,960
I'll definitely find a way.

366
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:39,020
EP03 WHO AM I?
