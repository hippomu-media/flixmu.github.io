20
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:03,090
So, are the warriors going to take part?

21
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:06,970
Yes. We will participate as mercenaries.

22
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:08,729
It's a relief to hear that.

23
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:10,910
I am Cantil.

24
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:14,090
I've battled the Orcs many times.

25
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:15,840
I'm Yotsuya...

26
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:17,550
It's a pleasure to meet you, Mr. Cantil.

27
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:20,300
Wow, you look awesome.

28
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:22,930
With a veteran on our side,
nothing could go wrong.

29
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:28,510
Not bad.

30
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,760
Yeah!

31
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:34,990
An Orc's main weapon is the punches
it swings with his long arms.

32
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,820
A direct hit will result in death.

33
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:44,150
After every successful attack,
back out to a safe range.

34
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:47,970
Basically, you must maintain your distance
from the Orcs at all times.

35
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,500
A hit-and-run style of combat.

36
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:51,210
Okay!

37
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:51,850
Hey, you.

38
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:56,050
That short weapon won't be enough to
deal any lethal damage to them.

39
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,570
Do you have other weapons?

40
00:02:57,690 --> 00:02:59,980
No, this is all that I have.

41
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:02,200
Don't worry, Yotsuya.

42
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:05,890
Leave the Orcs to the warriors.

43
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:07,820
Right, Iu?

44
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:10,360
PASS

45
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:12,670
SUBPAR STRENGTH

46
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:16,579
I had planned for those unfit to use swords
to be our archers.

47
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:19,100
But if you can't pull a bowstring...

48
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:20,440
Sorry.

49
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:24,090
Never mind, I don't want to get too tired.

50
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:25,540
I'll raise my level!

51
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:28,570
No way I'm being kicked off the team
for being subpar.

52
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:32,420
I'll make a comeback!

53
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,079
Monsters other than the Orcs?

54
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,540
There are no other monsters on this island.

55
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:43,200
Our ancestors must have eradicated all of them.

56
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:45,340
Yeah, it's the pride of this island.

57
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:51,140
One can only gain experience
by defeating monsters.

58
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:53,050
Another way

59
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:57,560
is that magician can practice their magic
while a cook can practice cooking.

60
00:03:57,630 --> 00:04:00,270
Completing tasks corresponding to the classes
will give one experience.

61
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:02,170
Which means...

62
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:04,260
I want to start farming!

63
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:10,040
You're really good at this job.

64
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:14,840
My grandparents were farmers.
I used to help with the labors.

65
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:17,040
That is great.

66
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:22,570
No! This isn't why we invited you!

67
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:26,310
An earthquake?

68
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:28,130
It's pretty serious.

69
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:32,700
What happened?

70
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,420
The fruits are spoiled.

71
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,890
It happens a lot.

72
00:04:40,159 --> 00:04:43,670
The fruits on this island are usually smaller.

73
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:47,090
An earthquake can easily knock them off
from the trees.

74
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:50,150
The soil here is barren.

75
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,659
The soil is not fertile.
What do you use for fertilizer?

76
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:56,640
We've been using Buffo feces.

77
00:04:56,990 --> 00:05:01,370
But their number is dwindling,
so we don't get as much nowadays.

78
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:05,760
The Orcs' hunting habit affects even
the agriculture here.

79
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,550
Jiffon Island is a volcanic island.

80
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:12,130
The land is covered in volcanic ashes.

81
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:14,450
There aren't many organisms
to provide nutrients.

82
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:18,400
What else can I use as fertilizer
aside from Buffo feces?

83
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:21,960
Seaweed and seashells?

84
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:25,060
Are you sure we can use these
to fertilize the land?

85
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:30,110
Tear the seaweed into shreds and mix them
with the soil. Wait for it to decompose.

86
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,550
Can't we put them into the soil?

87
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:34,900
Fresh seaweed won't work.

88
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:38,900
They will go bad and cause the plants to wilt.

89
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:44,190
With Buffo feces, the bacteria will
handle the rest.

90
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:46,550
What are you looking at?

91
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:48,260
Do not stare at Yana.

92
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:52,900
-Yana's boobs are mine, and mine alone!
-Stop it!

93
00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:54,860
Don't do it in front of a guy...

94
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:57,909
Is this supposed to be normal between them?

95
00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:01,460
You two must be very close.
You're always together.

96
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:05,390
I'm keeping an eye out for any bad guy
that might mess with Yana.

97
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:07,310
No, I'm not a bad guy.

98
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:10,680
This guy is not interested in me at all.

99
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:14,100
Hey you! How dare you ditch Yana
like she was nothing!

100
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,540
What exactly do you want from me?

101
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:21,220
Only virgins like us are fit to be Baikudam.

102
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:24,300
We must retire when we lose our virginity.

103
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,900
But we have no one to take our place.

104
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,270
Virgins?

105
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:31,620
May I ask, how old are you?

106
00:06:32,659 --> 00:06:35,030
When we inherit the title of Baikudam at 12,

107
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:38,700
we thought we could retire at 18
after we got married.

108
00:06:38,890 --> 00:06:41,270
But we missed our chance at marriage!

109
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:44,650
Everyone thinks we are too lame
compared to our friends of the same age!

110
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,390
That was a critical impact to their spirit.

111
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:51,030
That's because there's no girl
to inherit the job.

112
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:55,240
Hang in there, Yana.
There will be one in a few years.

113
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:58,730
Could this be caused by the Orcs as well?

114
00:06:58,900 --> 00:06:59,470
Yes.

115
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:02,910
All the girl that would have become Baikudam

116
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:04,510
were all eaten.

117
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:10,200
I must level up as fast as I can.

118
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:13,300
Fried beans with shellfish and stem vegetable!

119
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:17,410
-It looks delicious.
-Cooking the shellfish I gathered

120
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:18,620
-Indeed!
-gives me experience for being a cook.

121
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:23,170
Smash the shells and mix them
with Buffo feces.

122
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,970
Good, it's a healthy stink.

123
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:31,500
There are hot springs on this volcanic island.

124
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:36,110
High heat and humidity environment
is great for breeding microbes.

125
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:38,659
Creature Magic,

126
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:42,380
accelerate the reproduction and
decomposition speed of the microbes.

127
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:48,830
I can't believe it.

128
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:52,850
He managed to make
fertilizer in such a short time.

129
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:55,159
Well, it should have taken longer.

130
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,070
This is only an exception.

131
00:07:57,940 --> 00:08:00,150
It concerns my leveling.

132
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:04,490
These simple tasks take forever to complete.

133
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:08,140
Do you have any radio station here?

134
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:09,680
Lasso station?

135
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:13,620
Something like singing
that makes farming less boring.

136
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:17,190
We're great at singing.

137
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:19,910
There is a Dengaku song
that's been passed down for generations.

138
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,210
Aoiu, let's get ready.

139
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:22,810
Yeah.

140
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:29,380
Dengaku? Is that what they sing while farming?

141
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:42,669
Now, the 100th generation of Baikudam

142
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:46,600
will now perform a song
that's been passed down for 800 years.

143
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:48,780
I hope you enjoy it.

144
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,460
"The Yaoyorozu Island Tune."

145
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:55,920
Dengaku, Dengaku! Mi-so Dengaku!

146
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,590
The dawn of the Eastern Island,
dancing Dango!

147
00:08:58,670 --> 00:08:59,910
The earth is shaking!

148
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:01,260
My heart is blooming!

149
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:04,050
Give it your best on the field!
Hey-yah! Go-lah!

150
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:14,490
Karehama, tofu, and jellycakes.

151
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:19,190
Mountaintop, ridge, and heaven's wrath.

152
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:24,800
-Yana!
-Ocean wave, let's enjoy Hamatokimi.

153
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:29,500
It melts in your mouth, hooley-hooley!

154
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:30,600
Aoiu!

155
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,580
What will...

156
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:34,390
become of us?

157
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:37,240
Dengaku, Dengaku! Mi-so Dengaku!

158
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:39,850
The dawn of the Eastern Island,
dancing Dango!

159
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:41,340
Island of prophecy.

160
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:42,700
Melodies of the island.

161
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:44,080
We'll sing...

162
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:45,970
just for you!

163
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:50,920
That's just some generic idol song!

164
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:55,880
EXP: EXPERIENCE IS NEED
TO LEVEL UP THE CHARACTER

165
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:56,800
AT LEVEL 10, THE PLAYER CAN CHANGE THEIR CLASS.

166
00:09:56,810 --> 00:09:57,930
ITEMS MADE BY THOSE FROM THE PRODUCTION
CLASSES SUCH AS FARMERS AND COOKS

167
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:59,150
WILL GET MORE EXPERIENCE IF THE QUALITY
OF THEIR PRODUCTS IS HIGH ENOUGH

168
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:18,830
Curse it!

169
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:21,980
You're too slow.

170
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:25,870
Ryce, how did you get those amazing reflexes?

171
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:26,980
Enjoy your food.

172
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:28,730
We're counting on you.

173
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:29,420
Thanks.

174
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,420
Here, have some food.

175
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:32,480
Thank you.

176
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:35,290
You too.

177
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,580
This girl can literally heal your soul.

178
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,720
Katz, are you slacking off?

179
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:50,630
No, I'm drawing the map for this island.

180
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:51,350
A map?

181
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:56,250
Knowing the terrain is part of the preparation.

182
00:10:56,890 --> 00:10:58,990
But it's partly my hobby as well.

183
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:00,630
I've had enough of this!

184
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:05,580
Is this simple training too much for you?

185
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,530
Then you can only dream of defeating the Orcs.

186
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:09,970
That's why we hired you.

187
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:14,850
We spent a fortune to hire you.
The mercenaries should handle the battle.

188
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:15,720
What?

189
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:17,500
Calm down, Lolle.

190
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,830
You have a point.

191
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:22,220
But please understand this.

192
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:26,120
This isn't about money, it's about resolve.

193
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,770
We must eliminate the Orcs once and for all.

194
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:32,700
If we failed, they would wipe us out.
There are no other ways out of this.

195
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:36,430
These are the only outcomes
when you launch a campaign against the Orcs.

196
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:40,810
I was against the idea anyway!
This is too reckless!

197
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:44,960
Enough of your ranting.
We all make this decision together.

198
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:48,100
But they will kill everyone if we fail.

199
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:51,540
We might as well just keep giving them
Buffos as tribute.

200
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:54,360
What? Do you want to spend your life
as a slave that raise cattle for them?

201
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:56,190
They are getting on my nerve.

202
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,590
Lives are at stake, so it can't be helped.

203
00:11:58,970 --> 00:12:02,390
-Why don't you bring more fighters here?
-They can't revive themselves like us.

204
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,660
We have the money.
Don't look down on us islanders!

205
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,970
Don't take it wrongly.

206
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:10,450
Even mercenaries cherish their lives
above money.

207
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:12,960
The probability of winning is too low.

208
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:16,100
But you managed to gather five people
who aren't afraid of dying.

209
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:17,530
That's already a miracle.

210
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,210
I don't care about miracles!

211
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:20,270
Hey, look!

212
00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:23,410
An Orc!

213
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,470
Let me handle it.

214
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:26,860
You're a fast runner.

215
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:30,310
It was no wonder you survived
the remnant cleansing.

216
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:31,640
"Remnant cleansing?"

217
00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:33,630
You shall not pass!

218
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:47,470
Nice job, Iu!

219
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:58,510
I expected great reflexes from this man,

220
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:01,190
it seems like his experience battling
the Orcs wasn't a bluff.

221
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:06,120
This battle is taking up
too much time and stamina.

222
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:08,500
But it's working!

223
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:10,510
Move aside!

224
00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:19,060
He chopped off the Orc's fingers
that were hard as steel!

225
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:35,400
So this is what a battle with Orcs looks like.

226
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:39,370
There are still 14 of these tough jerks around.

227
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:45,560
Why would an Orc leave the castle and
come all the way here?

228
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:48,050
Did they know about our battle plan?

229
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,090
We have a mole among us!

230
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:56,550
A traitor among us is leaking information
to the Orcs!

231
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:03,110
Cut it out!

232
00:14:03,330 --> 00:14:06,330
All of us must work together to defeat the Orcs!

233
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:10,650
What was that?
It was you who hired the mercenaries.

234
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:13,810
He's right. We were all against the plan.

235
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:18,870
We used to have peace on this island.
But thanks to you, we're more divided than ever!

236
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:20,800
That was mean.

237
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:24,450
If you call yourselves a grown man,
then don't push the blame to the ladies.

238
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:25,800
You're disgusting.

239
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:30,400
Curse it. I wish they would get beat up
worse than those disgusting Orcs.

240
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:35,240
All of you, stop it!

241
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:37,730
Thanzamer?

242
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:41,160
Aren't you Thanzamer who ran away from home?

243
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:43,650
You remember me at last.

244
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:47,020
Yes, I came from this island.

245
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:49,780
So listen closely.

246
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:55,090
What would our ancestors think of us
if they saw us fighting each other?

247
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:04,470
Around 900 years ago, our ancestors

248
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:07,720
came to this island in search
of freedom and peace.

249
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,760
"You don't find a paradise, you build it."

250
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:17,790
Our ancestors built their settlements on
this forsaken island. It took years of work

251
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:19,960
to build the Jiffon Island we now live on.

252
00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:22,790
Are you going to let some petty money
divide the people?

253
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:27,050
When have you become so selfish
to think that human lives can be bought?

254
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:30,230
What is it that you want to protect?

255
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:36,430
Is it money? Status? Or the pride you acquired
for making this island your home?

256
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:44,920
The land, the people, the culture,
knowledge, and the pride as an islander.

257
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:50,990
Without them, this island is nothing
but a false paradise.

258
00:15:51,570 --> 00:15:52,810
I'll keep fighting.

259
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:58,520
We can't let this island become
a false paradise that is worth nothing!

260
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:01,920
Fight on!

261
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,610
Yes! This is our island!

262
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:07,530
They are all fired up.

263
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:10,040
Yes. We have to win this battle, General.

264
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:11,730
Are you...

265
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:18,720
I see. That child fought bravely.

266
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:22,800
Unforgivable! This is unforgivable!

267
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:26,120
I will avenge my child.

268
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:40,120
Congratulations! Wizard (Creature)
has reached level 10!

269
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:42,140
It's finally here!

270
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:44,250
Blacksmith.

271
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:48,210
Another class with 0.5% chance of getting!

272
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:49,480
This is the third time!

273
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:51,230
You must be doing it on purpose!

274
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:53,450
So what's the point of
having this roulette anyway?

275
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:54,200
So long.

276
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:55,340
Hey!

277
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,450
A blacksmith.

278
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:04,200
Speaking of which...

279
00:17:04,950 --> 00:17:06,660
There is an island called Jiffon Island.

280
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,500
It's famous for its weapon manufacturing.

281
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:12,670
I should check out the skill first.

282
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,890
"Ability to craft weapons and armors."

283
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:17,780
"Certain requirements must be met."

284
00:17:18,369 --> 00:17:20,819
"Accessible by all players."

285
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:23,630
Given our predicament,

286
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:25,660
this is the jackpot!

287
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:29,590
Sir, this adventurer wants you
to be his master.

288
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:33,210
Please teach me how to create weapons
capable of defeating the Orcs!

289
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:45,590
It seems impossible to master the skill
of smithing in such a short time.

290
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:48,200
You could try casting metal.

291
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:51,910
This technique doesn't require great precision.

292
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,200
Yes, Master!

293
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:14,240
It's done!

294
00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:19,500
A stake capable of killing an Orc!
The "Great Stake!"

295
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:22,260
So it's an ax with a stake.

296
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,790
Note: "Orc" and "stake" share similar initials.
Is this supposed to be a joke.

297
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:25,140
This thing has a weird shape.

298
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,990
It looks very clumsy.

299
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:30,020
We'll find out if it works then!

300
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:37,380
Yeah!

301
00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:46,860
The Great Stake was made by casting metal.

302
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:51,780
Furthermore, we have Hakozaki and Tokitate
who aren't good at hand-to-hand combat.

303
00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:53,600
So I prepared something special for you.

304
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:56,500
Thank you, Yotsuya.

305
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,560
Thank you, Yotsuya.

306
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:01,660
Well, it concerns our chances of survival.

307
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,060
I should get back to work.

308
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,820
Well? Which of them do you have a crush on?

309
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:10,460
Those three girls.

310
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:14,690
I'm calling dib on Iu.

311
00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:18,000
But while you're busy,
I already softened her up.

312
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:20,070
I simply can't fail.

313
00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:22,100
Sorry about that, Yusuke.

314
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,180
This guy is an idiot.

315
00:19:25,850 --> 00:19:27,760
How are we on a first-name basis anyway?

316
00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:31,130
Is this the ammunition for that weapon?

317
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:35,470
Yes. A player can't use any weapon
that is not part of their load-out.

318
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:38,280
Thankfully, the smithing skill comes in handy.

319
00:19:38,930 --> 00:19:41,140
Miss Aoiu told me

320
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:44,750
you barely had any sleep,
and you had been working non-stop.

321
00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:48,870
It's all right. I'm doing this
so our team can survive.

322
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:51,980
Yotsuya, you're always saying that.

323
00:19:52,810 --> 00:19:54,480
It's about priority.

324
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:56,520
It's the value of life.

325
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:00,000
Whose survival would be more beneficial
to the world?

326
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:04,090
This is how I judge the circumstances.

327
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,470
All right, it's done.

328
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:10,520
I'll make sure both you and Shindo
get to return safely.

329
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:14,840
Honestly, even if Torii didn't make it,
someone would replace him.

330
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:18,430
Eugenic ideology? That sounds dangerous.

331
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:23,840
At least I based my judgments on
circumstances and outcomes, not the background.

332
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:29,400
But circumstances are mostly related
to the background.

333
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:30,760
I disagree.

334
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,370
Under the same negative circumstances,

335
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:37,700
the rich and powerful are low
on my priority list compared to commoners.

336
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:41,200
With worthless scoundrel as the ruling class,
things could only get worse.

337
00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:42,240
Yotsuya!

338
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:45,580
I didn't see that coming.

339
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:48,560
That hit a little closer to home for me.

340
00:20:50,010 --> 00:20:52,750
I was once a commander.

341
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:59,240
The army I led lost in all seven battles,
which ultimately led to my country's demise.

342
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:02,360
So you were a general.

343
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:08,630
As Ryce said, that battle was fated to be
a defeat regardless of who was commanding.

344
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:11,920
He also said you were a great general.

345
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:15,110
No, I was foolish as a leader.

346
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:20,160
I missed the opportunity for a retreat
and lost countless soldiers because of it.

347
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:25,650
So I cannot afford to lose this upcoming battle.

348
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:28,290
"STRONGHOLD"
I've done whatever I can for preparation.

349
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:30,730
"HIGH GROUND"
I wouldn't say we have a strong army,

350
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:33,330
"HIDDEN WEAPONS"
but as long as we can strike them first,
