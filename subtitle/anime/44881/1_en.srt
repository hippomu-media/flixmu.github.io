You're not as young as you think.

3
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:27,500
You fall sick at this rate.

4
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:33,210
I'm doing this for my beloved sons.

5
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:35,020
I have to work hard for you.

6
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:41,180
DON'T EAT THEM UNTIL THEY SPROUT, FROM: MOM

7
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:43,790
Give me a break. Don't push yourself too hard.

8
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:09,230
Hey, old hag. This money isn't even enough
to pay off the interest.

9
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:12,550
Cursed jerk...

10
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:19,940
Shuji...

11
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:22,530
Hey, you brats.

12
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:28,410
I have a good deal coming up.

13
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:32,500
If you manage to pull it off,
you can clear the debt in one month.

14
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:36,020
Don't you want your mom to have a better life?

15
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:43,800
It's nothing too hard.
Just get rid of some traitor for me.

16
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,030
Who is this?

17
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:55,780
Cursed brat!

18
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:57,980
Stop!

19
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:08,230

20
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,950

Let's go camping.

41
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,380
A camping trip? That's a lot of work.

42
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:01,760
There are camping sites that require no gears.

Did you check out the previous one?

52
00:04:17,529 --> 00:04:20,039
-Sure! It must be a parody!
-See you.

-It's no wonder Iu is so popular.
-See you.

Are Shindo and Hakozaki very close friends?

55
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,490
They never have many interactions
with each other.

56
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,790
One is standing at the top as a superstar.

57
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:36,700
The other is barely memorable.

58
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:38,650
They are totally different.

59
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:55,000
Two people may not have a similar personality,
but they have strong will.

60
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:57,110
Was that why they were chosen?

61
00:04:57,136 --> 00:04:58,691
WHO WOULD YOU USE THE HEALING DUST ON? 
WARRIOR, MAGICIAN, OR HUNTER?

62
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:03,970
That can't be right. Tokitake was chosen too.

What is this?

80
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,540
Come on! What was that?

81
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:15,700
What is this place?

00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:20,990

00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:38,320

Present Jiffon Buffo on Baikudamania.

90
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,440
It's just more words that I don't understand.

91
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,130
The revival time is now 50 seconds.

92
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:53,160
There seems to be a new system.

93
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:57,630
Fast travel to previous locations.

94
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:00,590
This is an old system with restrictions.

95
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:03,220
Everyone is getting the hang of it.

96
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:09,190
The class of the fifth player Keita Torii...

97
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:13,070
What class?

98
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:16,040
-What do you mean? What is a class?
-I hope he gets a lousy class.

99
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:19,150
Warrior (Spear)!

100
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:22,360
What is happening?

101
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,590
Well, so long.

102
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,370
First of all, let's find out more
about the quest.

103
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:33,320
We should check out Cortonel first.

104
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:36,050
We should explain the situation to Torii first.

105
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:38,900
After we used fast travel,

106
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:41,910
we have to wait 24 hours before using it again.

107
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:46,590
We should start working on it
rather than wasting our time here.

108
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:49,390
I really don't like your tone.

109
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:53,010
We have more pressing mattes
 than your stress level.

110
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:55,810
Stop, Torii.

111
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:57,560
I'll only explain once, so listen closely.

112
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:03,920
We are in a fantasy world. We are the warriors.
We will die unless we complete the quest.

113
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:04,910
The end.

114
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:08,110
Iu, I think you oversimplified it.

115
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:14,040
All right, I don't get it. But it's okay!

116
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:20,500
I dropped out of middle school.
I don't understand complicated things.

117
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:24,470
It's not like you got a certificate for that. 
Note: Middle school drop-out is not a qualification in Japan.

118
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:27,170
I don't know anything, but I'll follow you.

119
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,590
Speaking of which, you there!

120
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:36,270
Here I come.

121
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,490
You're a pain in the neck.

122
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:40,580
Sorry about that, Yotsuya.

123
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,110
He insisted on doing this
if we want to fast travel.

124
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:47,920
Do it that attack that stops people in motion.

125
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:53,520
Are you ready?

126
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:54,610
Start!

127
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:59,690
Kneel!

128
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,270
An easy victory!

129
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:28,000
That hurts!

130
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:30,510
I won the fight!

131
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:33,360
The extra kick was unnecessary!

132
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:39,510
We're really in Cortonel.

133
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:42,510
Fast travel can come in handy.

134
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:46,530
Kahvel must be here somewhere.
Let's go see her.

135
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:51,360
Who is Kahvel?

136
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,950
She's someone who had our back
in the previous quest.

137
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:03,800
A bunch of thieves caught us.

138
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:04,700
For real?

139
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:06,550
My name is Thecus.

140
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:14,170
How long has it been since we last came here?

141
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,470
Fellow warriors!

142
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,310
Miss Kahvel!

143
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:28,340
It's been so long, brave warriors.

144
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:29,930
It's been 15 years.

145
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:31,590
Did you say 15 years?

146
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:40,670
They are my children.

147
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,420
Aren't they adorable?

148
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:46,800
She's an entirely different person!

149
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:58,630
I love chopping on living flesh!

150
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:00,740
I guess 15 years are enough to change a person.

151
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:03,240
About Jiffon Buffo...

152
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:06,030
Yes. Do you know what it is?

153
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:08,160
I don't know what "Buffo" means,

154
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:10,010
but I know a place called Jiffon Island.

155
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:12,870
It's famous for its production of weapons.

156
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:15,150
So Jiffon is an island.

157
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:17,910
Miss Kahvel, are you still a knight?

158
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:20,270
I'm no longer a knight.

159
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,270
I lost my right hand on the battlefield.

160
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:35,350
It was 15 years ago when the Kingdom of Deokk
started its campaign to unite the continent.

161
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:41,580
Cortonel and the other nations form
a coalition against their invasion.

162
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:43,550
A great war broke out.

163
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:48,910
The battlefield was hell on earth.

164
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,130
I was in four campaigns against the invasion.

165
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:56,780
But when I gave birth to my sons, I realized
it's challenging and rewarding to raise them.

166
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,600
I knew I couldn't keep doing it.

167
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,410
I became weak.

168
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:12,120
Kahvel from the past was just like me.
We both wanted more strength.

169
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:19,820
I think creation is always
harder than destruction.

170
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:26,350
Indeed. Raising kids is much more difficult
than killing soldiers.

171
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,980
She's right. Miss Kahvel is still very strong.

172
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:33,080
She changed.

173
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,710
She went through a war

174
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,650
and is now having kids.

175
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,590
I can only dream of having her strength.

176
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:49,180
I had some experience with childbirth.

177
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:52,000
I was only around five years old.

178
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:54,280
My mother started having contractions.

179
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,030
I delivered my brother on my own!

180
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:57,730
Isn't that cool?

181
00:12:58,590 --> 00:12:59,440
That's amazing!

182
00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:00,410
I know.

183
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:01,390
What about your father?

184
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:03,030
No, I only had my mom.

185
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:08,040
Then the loan sharks sent me
on an assassination job.

186
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:09,910
Do you mean murder?

187
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:13,470
This guy came out of nowhere
so I managed to get away.

188
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:17,850
The loan shark was arrested,
so our debt was settled.

189
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:21,100
Yotsuya.

190
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:25,990
That kick earlier was for my brother.

191
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:28,420
But I'm grateful for what you did last week.

192
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:29,920
Thanks.

193
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:43,970
The words and strength they have

194
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:45,380
are something I'll never have.

195
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:50,410
I want to become stronger more than anyone does.

196
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:04,040
I love watching the sunrise from here.

197
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:07,440
I wanted to watch it with you one last time.

198
00:14:13,070 --> 00:14:13,590
I thought...

199
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:17,610
I wouldn't see you again.

200
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,510
Good job. Thanks for the help!

201
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:28,730
That farewell was a little rushed.

202
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:32,250
I thought we would meet soon after.

203
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:38,100
I'm sorry to have you caught up in it.

204
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:43,920
If it wasn't for me,
Lord Bihmsberg would still be alive.

205
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:50,760
It was great to be young.

206
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:56,290
I've never had any great adventure since then.

207
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:04,670
Perhaps those memories
saved me from that living hell.

208
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:10,330
Thank you for dragging me in.

209
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:13,670
Is that true at all?

210
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:18,150
Did I really save her?

211
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:24,070
We would make a great couple back then.

212
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:27,310
We did have a lot in common back in the days.

213
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:31,230
Have you heard about

214
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:35,350
the story where Yusuke passed out
from overusing his magic?

215
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:36,240
No.

216
00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:38,890
I see.

217
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:43,190
That is such a shame.

218
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:56,610
I was once in love with you, Yusuke.

219
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:05,610
But I went ahead and grew old. I'm sorry.

220
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:07,690
It's all right.

221
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:11,090
Hey, Game Master.

222
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,190
Let's go.

223
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:16,930
Yeah.

224
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:18,860
What is this quest about?

225
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:21,900
What does the future hold for us?

226
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:25,350
I came to have fun.

227
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,080
It turned out to be heartbreaking.

228
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:34,340
Warriors!

229
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:47,500
It's been a long time. I'm Thecus.

230
00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:52,260
I'm Thecus!

231
00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:56,480
Everyone, run! I'll buy you some time!

232
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:04,410
Thank you for saving the village
from those Trolls.

233
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:07,930
It's been too long.

234
00:17:09,349 --> 00:17:10,489
How have you been?

235
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:14,350
Does everyone in this world...

236
00:17:19,569 --> 00:17:20,619
on meet each other once?

237
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:25,211
PLAYER'S OBJECTIVE: COMPLETING THE QUEST
GIVEN BY THE GAME MASTER WITH EACH QUEST COMPLETION,

238
00:17:25,227 --> 00:17:27,060
PLAYER GETS TO ASK ONE THE GAME MASTER
ONE QUESTION EVERY QUEST WILL COME WITH A NEW MEMBER.

239
00:17:27,068 --> 00:17:28,925
AFTER TEN QUEST COMPLETIONS, THE GAME
IS COMPLETED SIX WEEKS FROM GAME COMPLETION

240
00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:34,750
It's an honor.

241
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,410
The warriors are visiting Jiffon Island.

242
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:40,890
Did you see the mercenary recruitment notice?

243
00:17:41,130 --> 00:17:42,000
Mercenary?

244
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:45,490
Isn't that why you're here?

245
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:48,150
We can see it from here.

246
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:50,920
That's Jiffon Island.

247
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:09,080
Welcome.

248
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:12,740
We are Dengaku shrine maidens. I'm Yana.

249
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:14,530
I'm Aoiu.

250
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:19,620
"MERCENARIES, WELCOME TO JIFFON ISLAND!"
Welcome fellow mercenaries!

251
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,880
But...

252
00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:28,650
We only told them we weren't mercenaries.

253
00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:30,940
The hospitality just vanished from their faces.

254
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:34,590
First, we need to understand the unknown word
in our quest objective.

255
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:37,990
May I what Baikudamania is?

256
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:41,400
It's a harvest festival.

257
00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:44,230
Do you know anything about Jiffon Buffo?

258
00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:47,700
Hey you! Why should we give free information?

259
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:48,740
That's right.

260
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:51,660
You two are so cute.
Can I ask you out sometimes?

261
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:54,190
They will think you're a pervert, so shut it.

262
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:56,870
What's wrong? Are you upset?

263
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:59,010
They are upset because we aren't mercenaries.

264
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,520
Well, I'll have to give them the thing...

265
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:08,090
Here it is!

266
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:10,090
Jiffon Buffo!

267
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:12,080
This is creepy.

268
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:14,740
So for our quest this time around...

269
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:17,310
On the harvest festival
known as the Baikudamania,

270
00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:19,840
we must use that cow-like animal as a sacrifice.

271
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:23,230
We're not having Baikudamania this year.

272
00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:30,300
That's the cause.

273
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,390
Kumamo Castle.

274
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:37,620
Our ancestors built it 400 years ago.
It's an impregnable fortress.

275
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:42,160
Five years ago, survivors of a shipwreck
took over the place.

276
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:43,300
They are...

277
00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:45,430
I see them.

278
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:47,430
Orcs.

279
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:51,430
The one at the front is their queen.

280
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:56,980
Five years ago, the Orcs came to this island
and started a war.

281
00:19:57,270 --> 00:19:59,230
Our people suffered a humiliating defeat.

282
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:03,670
Before the Orcs wiped us out,
we surrendered to them.

283
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,870
But we miscalculated.

284
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:07,440
What do you mean?

285
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:10,970
The Orcs aren't here for war,

286
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:14,540
they are here to eat our people.

287
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:17,920
Do the Orcs still eat the islanders?

288
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:19,610
Even if they surrender?

289
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:24,360
The islanders use Jiffon Buffos
as sacrifices for those Orcs.

290
00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:29,210
In order to survive, we serve the Orcs
by raising Buffos as tributes for them.

291
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:32,680
So all the Buffos belong to the Orcs.

292
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:35,430
That's why they can't be used
for the harvest festival.

293
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:38,250
Their number grows every year.

294
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:41,120
At this rate, there won't be
enough Buffos for them.

295
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:43,560
Then they will start eating humans again.

296
00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:46,010
Is this why you are hiring mercenaries?

297
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,580
We must strike first.

298
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:52,300
This year's Baikudamania is 11 days from now.

299
00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:58,320
We'll start by killing the Orc Queen
and eliminate this Orc menace.

300
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:03,400
All we need to do is to defeat them.

301
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:05,730
That sounds simple enough.

302
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:07,550
He's not worried at all.

303
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:09,680
But they outnumber and outmatch us.

304
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:11,560
How do we level the playing field?

305
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:15,680
I'm curious, what do the shrine maidens do
during the Baikudamania?

306
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:20,840
We perform the Dengaku dance.
We're mainly the event hosts.

307
00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:23,900
Is there no one else to take your place?

308
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:25,430
No.

309
00:21:26,770 --> 00:21:29,460
We have to make sure everyone
at the ceremony is safe as well.

310
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:31,630
There are too many aspects to cover.

311
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:37,330
They are hiring mercenaries.

312
00:21:37,690 --> 00:21:38,350
Yes.

313
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:44,120
You report was just in time.

314
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:55,080
