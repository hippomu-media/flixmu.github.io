The series begins showing a normal high school day of class 2-3, until a bright beam of light suddenly appears and destroys the entire class. As the screen fades to black, Kumoko wakes up only to discover that she has been reincarnated as a spider. To Kumoko's horror, there are hundreds of other spiderlings hatching around her. Since there are no food available the spiderlings resort to cannibalism by eating their siblings.
